"I also forgot what a big part Professor Lockhart played in this book I especially liked what he did for Valentines Day as this gave a chance for Ginny to show that she likes Harry quite a lot which is something we dont see in the movies till like the sixth movie I think ",?
"Overall I really did enjoy rereading this but I think I know now why I enjoyed it less than the others and it is probably because it feels like there isnt a lot of Hermione near the end because she gets petrified and if you didnt know she is one of my favorite characters out of the series ",?

"What distinguishes good magic from bad magic",?
"What stops anyone simply casting a spell",?
"I know that the spells end up going wrong without practice but there really arent a lot of procedures or ideas in these books that explain any of that to meSo my review here will stand as a brief examination of how Ive found the first two books in this series ",?
"Books that I finally decided to read after a long history of more classic childrens novels and fantasy ",?
"The question at this point is why did these books become so popularFirstly is it the fantasy",?
"I will say that most of the fantasy ideas in these two books are oldhat ",?
"Sure there are some new ideas or new ways of using the ideas here and there but on the whole the books are a conglomeration of previous myths fairytales and folklore ",?
"So maybe these books made these ideas more accessible for a whole generation to see how interesting the whole fantasy genre wasAnother thought that comes to mind is the whole growing up with Harry method ",?
"By which I refer to how Harry Potter ages as his readers age meaning that ",?
"Yet that said he lacks any great definition as a character ",?
"Im sorry to anyone who said JK Rowling was a brilliant prose author yes I see her moments from time to time but on the whole she spends her novel writing so sparsely and telling her readers so much about her characters that I just wish she would spend some time showing now and then ",?
"Which leads me to one other point marketing ",?
"Which is why I was so skeptical about these novels for so long ",?
"I looked at the craze surrounding them and thought it seems like some fad of marketing ",?
"And reading these trying to be critical I would agree ",?
"The plotting is messy which may be better in the films but again I havent seen those because I tend to read the books first the characterization and development isnt great in the first two books and most of the ideas are sourced from elsewhere ",?
"So my conclusion stands that these books became so popular because they were a whole new line of popular fantasy and the movies helped too ",?
"Its the same thing I see happening with Game of Thrones and what I saw happen with Hunger Games and Divergent though I like Hunger Games a little moreAnyway thats enough from me ",?
"At least until I finish A Dance with Dragons and can complain about that instead ",?

"I donUt even understand why Dobby felt Harry was in mortal danger ",?

"Regardless Moaning Myrtle is a GHOST ",?
" years prior the basilisk killed Myrtle ",?
"Myrtle says that she floated away but then came back and that she UCwas determined to haunt Olive HornbyUD page I got the impression perhaps from Order of the Phoenix from Sir Nick the ghost of Gryffindor House that becoming a ghost after death takes advance planning ",?
"Myrtle died unexpectedly not sure what year she was at Hogwarts but letUs assume too inexperienced to UCdo the magicUD to let herself come back as a ghost ",?
"Is MyrtleUs desire perhaps even when she was still alive to haunt Olive Hornby enough for Myrtle to have come back as ghostPerhaps some witches and wizards do UCplan aheadUD and become ghosts after their natural lives end ",?
"Perhaps for others who die before their time becoming a ghost is random and spontaneous ",?
"Case in point Professor Bins History of Magic teacher is said to have died in the teacherUs lounge but simply rose up from his chair as a ghost and continued to go about teaching his classes ",?
"Also Myrtle mentions to Harry that if he had died in the Chamber of Secrets she would have shared her toilet with him ",?
"Perhaps Myrtle was just hoping this random becomingaghost thing would happen with Harry if he had diedAs a side note it is interesting to note that it seems that Myrtle did not tell anyone that Hermione Harry and Ron were brewing polyjuice potion in her bathroom ",?
"Myrtle seems quite lonely so perhaps she enjoyed their presence even though a lot of times the three of them just ignored her Awards After the Chamber of Secrets ordeal in McGonagallUs office Dumbledore says that Ron and Harry will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School ",?
"In all seven books there is never any description of any kind of awards ceremony ",?

"Honestly listening to Dobbys voice being narrated in the audiobook was amazing ",?
"Regardless with all these warnings from Dobby Harry manages to return back to Hogwarts by the rescue from the Weaselys and their flying car",?
"I loved that scene in the movie and reimagining it again was amazing ",?
"Not forgetting their journey to Hogwarts in the flying car and almost getting killedUpon their grand arrival at Hogwarts theyre warned for breaking the rules and what not and they meet their new Defence Against The Dark Arts Professor Lockhart ",?
"I absolutely hated him and he was so phony",?
"Like I could see through him right from the start ",?
"Hated that douche bag",?
"All his miserable attempts at teaching in his lesson was hilarious too",?
"All the warnings from Dobby turned out to be true when there are people getting frozen and the cat being frozen as well ",?
"I just wonder how does Harry have such great guts to face such horrible creatures and mysteries ",?
"I would run away immediately ",?

"Harry still doubts his placing in Gryffindor ",?
"He feels that maybe the sorting hat may have made a mistake in placing him in Gryffindor ",?

"ThereUs too much idiocy really ",?
"The flying car is dumb ",?
"Hermione turning into a halfcat is dumb ",?
"Gilderoy Lockhart is dumb though played extremely well by Kenneth Branagh in the movie ",?
"Aragog the big blind spider is dumb ",?
"And even Dobby is dumb long before he becomes interestingFor all these reasons the book feels outside the Potter universe ",?
"Almost everything in the other book makes sense to me but this one is bizarre ",?
"What makes it worth reading despite its dumbness are the bits and pieces that hint at the world well see in the future the introduction of Dobby and the house elves the first taste of Tom Riddle the beginning of the long road of love for Ginny and Harry the naming of Azkaban as a prison that evokes terror and the introduction of the surprisingly important Moaning Myrtle set us up for whats to come ",?

"Some people tend to think this book is the worst in the whole series but I disagree I find this one of the best ",?
"Why",?
"Well of course it was incredible to be introduced to Hogwarts in the first book with all its houses and classes and festive traditions but a story needs more than that ",?

"Why",?
"Well of course it was incredible to be introduced to Hogwarts in the first book with all its houses and classes and festive traditions but a story needs more than that ",?
"To be good a story needs depth and in order to gain depth the writer must come up with enough background either to the characters individually and to the story itself ",?
"I am sure this series could have gone down hill with no more than three books had the author not perceived it needed to be matured young kids who had read and been enchanted by Sorcerers Stone would get older so the story had to get a few darker shades in order to keep up with their aging otherwise audience would declineThis book provides enough background for a second book making you feel like reading more ",?
"Of course we get to see Harry Ron and Hermione back together at Hogwarts but its not all happiness and welcoming friends anymore ",?
"The Chamber of Secrets already at its beginning sends us a clear message everything is different and there is real danger around ",?
"Most of the danger is caused by intangible old magic ",?
"After a very clever fashion Rowling gives hints to what the story would become years later as we see Harry and his friends discovering some of the dark past of some characters and of Hogwarts itself ",?
"Some of the messages seen in the first book are reinforced like the value of friendship and power of loyalty but other than that this book is much more complex dark and matureI wont spend much effort trying to explain anything down to details since pretty much everyone that hasnt been living under a rock knows most of the story ",?
"Instead I will just cover a few points which I really enjoyed and which I didnt like that much while reading The Chamber of Secrets ",?
"First of all despite the new shadowy atmosphere provided by the whole reopening of the Chamber of Secrets situation Hogwarts felt a lot more real and familiar here than in Sorcerers Stone ",?
"Part of it is due to the fact that at some point the fear of being attacked by the mysterious monster that was roaming around was so strong that everyone got closer to each other ",?
"There were lots of scenes describing people chatting on the common rooms having snacks together it felt cozy and warm despite the palpable danger ",?
"The other aspect that I liked was how difficult the author made every part of the investigation Harry Ron and Hermione were running in order to find out the truth about the heir of Slytherin ",?
"The fact that they had to work for months on the Polyjuice potion only enriched the story made it more real in most books about witches they just flick their wands and everything happensIve been trying to think about the negative aspects anything that I dont like about The Chamber of Secrets ",?
"The only thing that comes to my mind though is the same complaint that would come from Ronald Weasley spiders ",?
"I also suffer from arachnophobia so those chapters full of spiders were a real pain for me to read without having to check every corner of my room every five seconds ",?
"Overall though this book is flawless ",?
"Interesting quotes that I didnt include in the review It is our choices Harry that show what we truly are far more than our abilities ",?
"So this just happened ",?
"Yes ",?
"My first time reading this book ",?
"Did I love it",?
"Yes ",?
"Did I cry all the time at all those sweetcompassionate moments",?

"The entire concept of mudbloods is another thing that got me really thinking this time around because Rowlling has this whole action adventure series but manages to include these little bits of too much truth ",?
"Its prejudice and hate based on things people cannot control ",?

"I refused to peek ahead so I would be surprised ",?
"And I surely was surprised starting with the table of contents which was crawling with lifelike spiders ",?
"Im a bit phobic of spiders you see and there were many of them in this book ",?
"Im sure Ill see them in my dreams or should I say my nightmares",?
"But there were many more illustrations to savor that were atmospheric or dramatic or captured the essence of each character at any particular moment in time ",?

"Now thats artistic talent",?
"As for the story I enjoyed accompanying Harry as he began his second year at Hogwarts where he encountered a challenging mystery threatening peoples lives along with the very existence of Hogwarts ",?
"This second year at school was a trying one for Harry even before he headed off for classes due to the Dursleys determination to make him miserable over vacation ",?
"Most children wish for a break from school but not Harry since Hogwarts is the closest thing to what he can call a home ",?
"He made many friends there his first year but also enemies its clear when he returns ",?
"And he learned a lot in his first year especially about friendship but during his second year he learned even more though not all of his lessons were learned in the classroom ",?
"In fact his most important lesson his second year had nothing to do with defense against the Dark Arts or potion mixing ",?
"Instead it came from Dumbledore himself when he told Harry It is our choices that show what we truly are far more than our abilities Along the way Harry also learned about goodness loyalty courage trust patience and tolerance not to mention disappointment prejudice cowardice and the many forms in which evilness can masquerade ",?
"I wonder what Harry and his friends will learn in their third year ",?

"This book just read better the previous mild cheese coating dusted away leaving a fun joy behind ",?
"Its not all happiness and games however what good story would be",?
"Theres a darkness lurking around the corner and a mystery to solveFirst the professor Gilderoy Lockheart ",?
"The new Dark Arts teacher is introduced to this series bringing numerous hilarious scenes that worked perfectly ",?
"What fun it is to follow the three kids through their classes the clueless and boastful professor is a contrast to the experiences in the classroom of the slithering Snape who seems to have it against the kids ",?
"Hogwarts itself has such a strong presence in the novels from the teachers the classes the studied subjects Dumbledore Hagrid and his cottage of tea and bizarre animals that creepy Forbidden Forest with giant critters that nightmares are made ofand now lets throw in secrets passages and riddles and secret diaries ",?
"If that doesnt make a workable magical concoction then I dont know what doesSince Id experienced the story celluloid style it held little surprise ",?
"Im sure if I were naive going in Id have been surprised at the twist with the riddle for Tom Riddle the discovery of the creature waiting in the bowels of the school and the small twists that came about but it was still a joy to experience in written form even if I knew the waiting answers ",?
"Pacing is kept up strong youd think it may be dull to spend so much time in a classroom but not at all for it unfolds naturally applying in various ways to not only the main story of the Chamber but to small details of the characters lives that will continue enriching the seriesHarry is a wonderful protagonist hes reasonable and decent but still a typical type of wizard kid willing to break small rules all for a spot of fun or dire circumstances ",?
"Ron is humorous without meaning to be that unfortunate type who has bad luck and circumstance but shines with their general personality and of course Hermione is a great confidante and friend you like to have around especially when you arent sure of the right curse to muster or potion to mixDefinitely recommended hard to put down I enjoyed this one more than the first ",?
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone wasnt bad but something felt awkward to me kind of like the beginning of one those odd school moments where teachers are trying to get kids to learn lame square dancing and then sectioning the kids into gender to dance together ",?
"Im happy to say that awkwardness isnt present in Chamber of Secrets and the heart of the series has started beating harder its not possible for me not to continue this series now ",?

"One aspect of the book I loved was how Rowling built Harrys numerous conflicts ",?
"There was internal conflict which house does Harry really belong in external conflict with other individuals darn the Malfoy family and all of Slytherin and external conflict with society everyone suspecting Harry of being the heir of Slytherin ",?
"When all of these clashes are resolved by the end of the book it brings a strong feeling of satisfaction to those who empathize with Harry the underdog from the start ",?
"Not to mention that I saw none of the plot twists coming that shows how even adults can attain entertainment from this series even if they have more foresight than I do ",?

"The fact that this book in the series already started to betray the much darker themes that would come into the later books is something I love there is something so chilling about the bloodthirsty Harry hears the Petrified students and the messages daubed in blood ",?
"And one of my alltime favourite things about this book",?

"The last chapters of the book are the best in my opinionOne of the things I enjoy most about these books is how easy it is to read it how simple the story seems when at the same time is so complex and even though the plot focuses on one thing as its title says I think the writer manages to play many different topics as well without changing the main point UCHearing voices no one else can hear isnt a good sign even in the wizarding worldUD I love Ron and Hermione alike their personalities are so different and somehow have managed this beautiful friendship ",?

"Well I felt that way before starting this but I can definitely say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter seriesAnd while I will admit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor I still enjoyed it a great deal ",?
"I think the reason for my not liking it as much can be mostly credited to the introduction of a new character Professor Lockhart ",?
"Lockhart is an annoyingly pretentious wizard who is completely full of himself and the majority of his teachings were based on his own life and his supposed brushes with death that he escaped only because of his heroism and great knowledge of the magic arts ",?
"view spoilerRiiiiiiiiight ",?
"hide spoilerIn a summary I didnt find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harrys realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at HogwartsBut HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders not to mention the lovely cast of characters to more than compensate for this particular installments slightly lacking plot ",?

"Before he gets there though he had to fight the depression from loneliness as his adopted family does not care about him much and his Hogwarts friends seemingly forgotten about him ",?
"Fortunately a magical creature called Dobby shows up and instantly makes Harrys life full of excitement he is convinced Harrys life is forfeit if the latter goes to Hogwarts so Dobby makes everything in his power to stop Harry from doing this ",?
"Injures and maiming are fair game as long as Harry remains alive ",?
"To add to the fun it seems Harrys life as well as that of his friends might really be in danger Dobby hinted at ",?
"Like the first one this book can still fully qualify as a children book however it is darker and it does have some very gloomy and depressing moments children grew up and matured a little and so is the tale ",?
"We get to meet characters familiar from the first book and see their development as well as new interesting ones ",?
"Speaking about new people Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself he is excellent ",?
"His whole Valentine celebration made me laugh out loud ",?
"I think this is the first time we get to meet Lucius Malfoy in person he is another interesting guy the last scene with him is excellent ",?
"I would like to talk about Harry Potter a little ",?
"I saw lots of people say he is not the main hero of the series he is just a guy who always gets either lucky or have a helpful friend handy in tight spots ",?
"I saw Hermione named the main hero she is the brainpower behind Harrys successes most of the time ",?
"I saw Neville named the main hero he has the greatest and most unexpected development of all characters ",?
"I would respectfully disagree Harry Potter is the main hero albeit a reluctant one compare him to Lockhart to see why ",?
"For the proof of this look no further than the final confrontation in this novel ",?
"This was my reread of the book I knew exactly what to expect and I was sure I would rate it with stars until I found myself awoke well in the early morning hours finishing this reread despite the fact that I had to wake up early ",?

"Harry goes back to his old home for summer and spends time with his ugly family The Dursleys ",?
"They are no different then they were before but in fact are even more rude ",?
"As Harry thinks about going back to Hogwarts a new and ugly creature appears in Harrys bedroom as Harry returns upstairs ",?
"His name is Dobby and he is known as a houseelf one that is treated badly ",?
"But Dobby didnt come to chat with Harry he came to warn him ",?
"Warn him about Hogwarts and save him telling him he must not return to Hogwarts ",?
"He says this because he is trying to warn Harry and tell him that he can put the whole school in danger including his friends and himself ",?
"But because Harry does not listen and is actually able to go back to Hogwarts thanks to his best friend Ron a lot of things happen this second year and some arent the best ",?
"Some include agony being made and being taken back in time a new professor named Gilderon Lockheart a spiritghost who died in Hogwarts and now haunts the girls bathroom named Moaning Myrtle and even events having to do with Ron Weasleys younger sister Ginny ",?
"These arent the only events happening and the only ones making Hogwarts suffer ",?
"They actually have nothing to do with it ",?
"There is somethingUor maybe someoneUwho is leading Hogwarts to danger and putting everyone at risk ",?
"This person or thing is turning students into stone writing on the walls and killing a professors cat ",?
"As rumors spread nobody knows who this might be ",?
"It might be Draco Malfoy since he is known as an evil child wizard in Slytherin or maybe Hagrid since he has been in Hogwarts for a very long time including his studying years there ",?
"Or any other professor including Snape Dumbledore McGonagall or even Lockhart ",?
"But if it isnt any of those then it might just be Harry himselfI really dont know what to say ",?
"Words arent possible because this book was just so wonderful and so fun ",?
"There were even more magical journeys and I was so glad everyone has changes and JK Rowling decided to changer everyones character ",?
"Well almost ",?
"Where do I start",?
"Harry is still the cute cinnamon roll and I love his precious and cute character ",?
"I hate how he had to suffer even more with the Dursleys and had to even go back as the second year ended ",?
"I hope he escapes one day for good and never returns because I am so tired of him being treated like shit and like he really does not exist ",?
"His family is the only family he really has yet they treat him like they wish he was dead and didnt survive The Chamber of Secrets ",?
"Sure thats what they wish but they should show a little more empathy with him and treat him a little better maybe feed him more food and give him better clothes let him go out with his owl and have some freedom let him write back to his friends when they know he is miserable with them and just be the young Harry Potter he was made to be ",?
"Other than that he is growing and growing into a much better wizard and is slowly learning even more spells which he ended up using some to defend his friend and fight Draco withRon oh Ron he is so cute and precious but so dumb in such cute ways ",?
"He still cant figure out the right magic spells and how to use them making the rest of the crowd laugh at him because of his silly actions ",?
"Hes so funny and when hes worried his face reactions are so cute but so heartbreaking at times because he is just so adorable ",?
"Draco didnt mock him like he did in the previous book and I was glad for that but he still received laughter from others because of the message he got from his mother the way he tried learning transfiguration and for needing his mother to defend him ",?
"He isnt learning quick like Harry but I know the time will come and he will become a good wizard and be able to change things into the right objects be able to drive a flying car correctly and defend his friend like he defended him when he needed the saving ",?
"Hermione was probably my favorite ",?
"She has changed so much and isnt a bossy hightop nerd anymore ",?
"Shes always at the top able to answer questions before anyone and earning Gryffindor points and that is the reason I loved her a lot more ",?
"What would Gryffindor Harry and Ron do without Hermione",?
"Like my friends have said probably dead or lost because they cant figure out what to do or how things work ",?
"She actually breaks rules in this book to help Harry and Ron and is also helping them with the secrets they are trying to discover ",?
"She still supports Harry with his Quidditch matches and is there for them when they need help even when she wasnt supposed toYou might be wondering what the stars mean",?
"Well like others Ginny was my least favorite character ",?
"I wish she didnt get in the way and wasnt the reason for the secrets but she was also really dumb ",?
"She acted dumb in front of Harry and tried stepping up for him only embarrassing herself ",?
"She was embarrassed by her mom because she was accepted into Gryffindor but she was still dumb ",?
"She didnt have to listen to Riddle and couldve made the choice of leaving everything out ",?
"Of course the book would be different and maybe quite boring if it wasnt for her but I still didnt like her character majority of the time ",?
"I hear shes one of the least favorite characters and I can see why ",?
"Shes pretty annoying and is always blushing when she sees Harry ",?
"Im guessing she likes him",?
"Dobby was not my favorite either only because he tried telling Harry what to do but at the end sure I liked him and was glad he was free because Malfoy was not a good master for him ",?
"He kicked and hit him for no reasons so Im sure that the reason for his actions when Harry told him to sitThe friendship has definetely grown and Hermione Ron and Harry are just best friends ",?
"They worry about each and everything about them together is just so cute ",?
"I will admit that I liked this one a little less than the first one but just a little bit ",?
"I dont use half stars or anything anymore so dont be thinking the first one was better and this one had its flaws because it really didnt disappoint me ",?
"I just hated some characters and that happens in all novels and Draco is still one of them ",?
"Hes an asshole fight me",?
"Like him or not I feel like I will always hate him ",?
"I feel like he will grow out to be just like this father and become an evil wizard like all Slytherins do ",?
"I know his appearance wont change and his personality wont either ",?
"He treats Harry like shit as well because of who he is and sometimes he thinks hes cool because of his father ",?
"But his father is nothing but a lousy and loud man that tries to show off because of his son and because of what he can afford ",?
"There was nothing new about him and I hate him for almost everything ",?
"Well everything actuallyHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets did not disappoint and left me upset but it had different flaws than the first one ",?
"Bad ones but Im sure theyll be fixed sometimes ",?
"I just didnt like Dobby at the beginning but like I said I was glad he was free at the end and defended Harry from Lucius Malfoy ",?
"I know every story has its own improvement and all analyze but this one might be my least favorite ",?
"Its like I see it coming ",?
"Overall I cant wait to see where the next journey takes off and how Harry will escape the Dursleys again ",?

"The Chamber is filled not only with mystery but danger and legend its very existence is debated which no doubt refers to the elusive female orgasmMs ",?
"Rowling whose sexual impulses have no doubt been unfulfilled over the years is attempting to fulfill them by way of her own fiction ",?
"She has created a perfect sexual explorer in Harry Potter a young innocent and noble young man whose powers have not yet matured ",?
"Obviously a male that Rowling would feel comfortable with ",?
"This is especially interesting given the actual resident of the Chamber of Secrets a huge deadly serpent ",?
"And theres only one thing that a huge terrible serpent can representRowlings sexual past is the fertile ground in which this book was grown ",?
"It is her cathartic attempt to win over the guilty feelings that shes repressed from her former sexual life the one she regrets more than anything else by manufacturing a hero ",?
"That hero in Harry Potter represents the type of man for whom she would open her chamber pure of heart and noble of intention and most importantly under her control ",?

"Even those that should be above suspicion are not with the taint of pride and ambition and even the most beloved characters breathe with the fragility of humanity as the story relentlessly runs along through the darkened halls of Hogwarts ",?
"Beware secondyear students the desire to be great is a doubleedged sword beset with rubiesI first became a fan of Jo with Cuckoos Calling and it occurred to me breathlessly reading through Chamber of Secrets that the Riddle was solved ",?
"Finally ",?
"Why is Jo Rowling so good",?
"Its simple ",?
"Shes a mystery writerHarry Potter soars above Muggle mystery books because of its special additives ",?
"Magic yes and undeniably malleable lenient fantasy elements that Jo masterfully weaves and waves her wand over to manipulate and beef up the story as she sees fit but truly how many mysteries have we read collectively where we set them down and forget who the detective was or the suspect or whatever ",?
"Why is that",?
"Because of Jos reverse engineering no doubt an ancient Slytherin technique where the character comes first ",?
"No matter what and no matter which character ",?
"The books are entirely character driven and because we love The Boy Who Lived and He Who Shall Not Be Named and The Weasleys and Rubeus Hagrid and Ginny the cutest human being on planet earth and on and on and on we find ourselves shoulder to shoulder with our wouldbe sleuths and puzzle solvers and their we must we must attitude ",?

"Dear Diary I have a new favorite bookOh really what is itThrows diary out the window and runs away screamingAnd shivers at the mere mention of Azkaban I read Chamber of Secrets with far too much excitement and anticipation because knowing I was going into Harry Potter The Prisoner of Azkaban following Chamber of Secrets was the book I was waiting for the most and for that I blame Gary Oldman ",?
"I am a Sirius fan of Gary Oldman That said I had no idea that Chamber of Secrets would be so outstanding and leave me thinking the incredible Philosophers Stone was a perfectlypitched welcome handshake compared to the books to comeFor those who like to feel up a book for flaws I have none and I see none ",?
"I see the sheer verve of adventure and the scintillating luster of mystery gleaming hungryeyed and ready for more ",?
"You see as Philosophers Stone was about love Chamber of Secrets was about fearlessness ",?
"Fearlessness to speak the truth in the face of a lie fearlessness to stand up for whats inside your heart ",?
"Fearlessness to take a leap of faith and follow the path of destinyAlso I am very interested in how the issues gain maturity as Harry and the other characters age ",?
"Obviously there are deaths to come but in the case of Chamber of Secrets versus Philosophers Stone I could feel that sense of maturity creeping in just a bit and am so very excited for the continuation of the series Ill have to go buy some more chocolate frogs now as everything in the Wizarding World becomes increasingly dangerous and unhinged and wild and wondrously unforgettableRecommended for everyoneAnd points for Hermione for being epic even whilst being petrified ",?

"A lot of people cite this book as their least favorite in the Potter saga many of my friends included ",?

"Maybe its because I first read it as a child or its maybe because I was more interested in the fantasy aspect but I never really cared nor do I care now that it doesnt follow the same standard mystery guidelines ",?

"And our introduction to the Whomping Willow",?
"Come on people this is classic stuffI also love the part Ginny Weasley plays in this book not so much the whole helping the Heir of Slytherin thing but her mad crush on Harry ",?
"Maybe because I was granted the fortunemisfortune of having a brother a grade above me I also had the wonderful fortunemisfortune of crushing on all his super hott yes with two ts friends ",?
"Ah how I remember the days of pining for them of whining over their lack of return interest of cursing my blasted gapped teeth and frizzy hair ",?
"Of course unlike Ginny I was never able to woo any of them in the end even after my braces but I still think I did alright as far as men goOkay back to the text ",?
"I even enjoy ol Lockhart for what hes worth ",?
"Yeah hes obnoxious but thats the point right",?
"And yeah the degree to whch he is obnoxious is a little cartoony and unrealistic but lets not forget this is a childrens book after all ",?
