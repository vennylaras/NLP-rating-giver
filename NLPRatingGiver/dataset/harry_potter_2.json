Ms. Rowling does an incredible job in constructing not only her world but its inhabitants. But then they not only sold multiple millions of copies but seem to have inspired dozens (if not hundreds) of y/a books (and not a few adult adult reading level books)about (young) wizards and wizarding schools. Seems like Harry Potter may have been noticed. In this one we're going to find out more about the history of Hogworts and of course get clues and information that will serve us well as the series goes on. As the students of Hogworts come under threat stories of the long rumored Chamber of Secrets begin to circulate...is it real, has it been opened, was it ever opened before. Will anyone die?These are excellent books. "},

Plus I never get how wizards can manage normal life without learning basic stuff like maths and science. In this book, during the conversation between Harry and Dumbledore, it has a massive spoiler about the ending of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, particularly if you have read the Half-Blood Prince. This and all the books in this series have so many layers where at first it seems a simple story but also a story of good vs evil and the strength of love. The trio of friends has not really changed since the first book, but Harry is a bit snappier as he has got people believing he is attacking students. I like how Hogwarts feels like another character and changes in each book. I also like Dobby as he is loveable and Lockhart who makes me smile especially with the valentines Dwarves. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an amazing book full of mystery and danger and I would recommend it to fans of the first book.

The small oopses these kids make. Yet it is also what endears the book to me. The imperfection.We get more of a view of Diagon Alley, plus it's less savory companion, Knockturn Alley. I don't think I can ever learn enough about these places. So many interesting things and places!

It seems quite impossible to achieve, but it is so, believe me, I have read both. The Chamber of Secrets contains even more light-hearted humour and queer but high-spirited people. Not to forget more creatures, some that make me crawl, literally. Spiders, phoenixes, house-elves, you name them and they are there. I love how the Chamber of Secrets is a bit more challenging than the first novel. ItU+2019s a step up. Solving the riddles - pun intended - were more complicated and complex. As the characters are growing the riddles increasing in difficulty as well. I love the fact that there is clear character development. For example, Hermione, needs to convince Ronny and Harry (aka the rule breakers) to break the rules. She evolves as time goes by, as do the other characters. This is very realistic in its portrayal of the way people in the \"real\" world evolve and change too. The novelU+2019s story line is superb, it is truly impeccable. The way everything is introduced, explained, and done is executed perfectly. I am in love. I, hereby declare, that ANY novel written by J.K. Rowling is deemed worthy of praise. I trust her to write well. She has my sword, my axe, and my bow. Sonja, daughter of Suhaila, at your service *bows gracefully*.I cannot and I will not stop reading the sequels to this novel.

Harry Potter y la CU+00E1mara Secreta es uno de mis libros favoritos, presentU+00E1ndonos a Dobby, uno de sus personajes mU+00E1s entraU+00F1ables para todos los fans de Harry Potter. Recomiendo leer todos los libros de Harry Potter a todos los niU+00F1os, jU+00F3venes y adultos que aU+00FAn no lo hayan hecho. Es una historia fantU+00E1stica, equilibrada y de una escritura exquisitamente natural y bella. "},

Let's just go ahead and add that to the list of foreshadowing in my last review, shall we? 15/12/2012I first read Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets on a plane from London to Singapore in 1998. My mum handed it and Philosopher's Stone to me as I was boarding the plane, and told me to read them and let me know what she thought when she got back to Australia the following week. I read both books straight through without stopping. I read through dinner, and I kept reading when they dimmed the lights so everyone could go to sleep. Fourteen years later, I still love it. I love Gilderoy Lockhart's special bucket of crazy narcissism. I love the Ford Anglia. I love how there are so many little flashes of foreshadowing - the introduction of Azkaban, of Tom Riddle's diary, of the sword of Gryffindor, of the basilisk fangs, of Polyjuice potion. It's not my favourite Potter book, but I still love it."},

I was always looking forward to his scenes and no matter how tiny or \"useless\" they were, I enjoyed them all! He and his broken wand made me laugh so hard at times because those scenes were hilarious! And oh my, how protective he is over Hermione is just amazing. Yes, I already ship them.Another favorite part of mine was Dobby! I'm in love with this little elf and I was so, so happy in the end! He definitely deserved it and gosh, I hope I'll meet him again soon!  \"When in doubt, go to the library.\"Professor Lockhart really annoyed me but I didn't expect anything else. He was weird in the movie too and therefore I knew it wouldn't be any different in the book. I think I even disliked him more in the book than in the movie (of course). The other Professors were all fantastic and I liked how everyone seemed to be annoyed by Mr. Perfect-Hair. The Duelling Club was also pretty awesome and I loved Snape for what he did to Lockhart!

I love the characters, the storylines, the way it's written for children but reads like it's meant for absolutely anyone that wants to pick it up. It truly is timeless (I won't be surprised if Harry Potter is a classic in 50 years (maybe less)). The adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione will never be any less fun, and I know I'll miss the lighthearted air of the first two books once I dive in to the later part of the series. But still U+2014 I think the nostalgia that comes with reading these books over again will always be my favorite part, even if I'm going to be sobbing in Deathly Hallows. "},

I haven't read the series since I was 11 so the film adaptations's storyline was what I had in my head so it almost felt like I was reading the book for the first time which made it that much more fun. However, with that being said I also found myself picking up on a lot of small flaws or things that didn't quite add up for me but that didn't detract from my overall experience so this was easily a 5/5 read for me. I'm really excited to continue rereading the rest of the series. "},

Well I LOVE the Harry Potter movies so I waited until after I had seen the last movie before starting on the first book. Well my fears weren't well founded in this case. I love the book as much as the movie. Well written and well paced, the movie accurately represented the novel which isn't all that common, take The Hunger Games for instance.

I love the book as much as the movie. Well written and well paced, the movie accurately represented the novel which isn't all that common, take The Hunger Games for instance. I understand that the book will have more details than the movie did but overall I'm pleased with both media types. Harry is progressing at Hogwarts and all the intrigue continues in his second year of his wizardry school. He-who-must-not-be-named continues to hover around the edges and flavors the entire story. If you've seen the movies and enjoyed them I highly recommend reading the books."},

I already feel like a Hogwarts student tbh.Yup, I have to admit I'm officially in love with this series and also with the characters who, by the way, are perfectly well defined because this woman decided to make her books EVEN MORE perfect of course.Finally, I'd like to add that I love the way it's written. It's simple yet detailed and none of each books (1 and 2) bored me. There's not even one chapter in which nothing happens. Ugh it's just amazing okay?"},

With the Chamber of Secret's open, Harry has to face Voldermort again. You get just a little closer to learning more about what's going on with Harry. This is around the time Harry starts to realize the magical world isn't as happy as he thinks it is, what with how house elves are treated and all. He learns about the prejudices the magical world has for people of muggle decent and Squibs. The seeds start to get planted for the later books. It just gets better from here.I recently re-read this. It's still not my favourite in the series, but you get to see how brave Harry is, as if we didn't know already. There's so many concepts that come to life in Book Six, which makes the series seem very well planned out. Little details that seem like you can just toss them aside play an important role.I still like this book, but the Mandrakes are morbidly funny. They're all like, we're going to stew these plant people up. Stuff like that makes me enjoy the crap out of her books. She just has a weird, and fun sense of humour that shows up in the series regardless of how dark things get. Harry Potter books are like delicious ice cream."},

I also forgot what a big part Professor Lockhart played in this book - I especially liked what he did for Valentines Day as this gave a chance for Ginny to show that she likes Harry quite a lot which is something we don't see in the movies till like the sixth movie I think. Overall I really did enjoy rereading this but I think I know now why I enjoyed it less than the others and it is probably because it feels like there isn't a lot of Hermione near the end because she gets petrified and if you didn't know she is one of my favorite characters out of the series. In about a months time or sooner I will probably pick up Prisoner of Azkaban as I am quite excited to be rereading that book - it is by far my favorite in the series!!"},

These. Books. Honestly, I could end my review there, but I won't. Harry Potter is such a rare exception to my usual reading preference! I don't usually care for humor in books. You might think that makes me cold hearted, but I just really prefer other aspects of books more than jokes and silly situations. But what J.K. Rowling does with this series blends humor along with mystery, action, and adventure so seamlessly that I found myself laughing out loud on multiple occasions throughout the Chamber of Secrets and being totally charmed by it! Her writing is so unique and amazing!Hermione is much more likable in book two, thank goodness. She is still a little goody two-shoes for my taste, but her redeeming qualities far outweigh the annoying ones. At least she breaks a few rules this time! Harry continues to learn more about himself and his connection to Voldemort, which is really interesting to read the second time around, knowing what will happen later on and being able to piece it all together. Ron continues to be a hilarious character who I always feel a little sorry for (hopefully he gets a new wand soon)!Ginny, though... I know that she grows a lot through the series, but good grief she's dumb in this book. I can't help feeling that she acts much more immature than Harry, Ron, and Hermione did in their first year at Hogwarts, but maybe being the baby in the family will do that to a person. Professor Lockhart is so repulsive! I was right there with Ron and Harry gagging every time the man opened his mouth! Rowling definitely has a gift for bringing characters to life! As always, Dumbledore makes me smile and Draco makes me cringe... I could go on and on about all the other characters, but I'll stop there.Reading this book again makes me wish (again) that I had read them as a child - before seeing the movies. Even though I had forgotten a lot of the details, I can't imagine what it would have been like experiencing the story for the first time by reading the books with no clue about what the Chamber of Secrets was! If, like me, you missed out on this one as a child, I highly recommend you give it a try now! You'll regret waiting so long."},

As I'm studying these and looking for trauma and memory, I'm fascinated at what I'm finding. Memories so strong that they can come alive. Memories that can be obliterated in a moment with a spell. A cast system in the wizarding world made up of an ideology that there are wizards that are \"pure\" or \"mudblood.\" The system going even darker/deeper by enslaving certain magical creatures. For the life of me, I can't figure out how Rowlings justified sending Harry back to the Dursley's when they had bars on his window and were feeding him through a pet door. Seems a bit harsh. #understatement Next up on my Potter revival-Azkaban!! :)  \"Harry-I think I've just understood something! I've got to go to the library!\" And she sprinted away, up the stairs. \"What does she understand?\" said Harry distractedly, still looking around, trying to tell where the voice had come from. \"Loads more than I do,\" said Ron, shaking his head. \"But why's she got to go to the library?\" \"Because that's what Hermione does,\" said Ron, shrugging. \"When in doubt, go to the library.\" -pg 255  It is our choices, Harry, that shows what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" -pg 333 "},

I also disliked Ginny intensely and didn't enjoy the way she was basically just a damsel to be used and rescued. I am also getting tired of how many times the female characters are being described as \"being giggly\" every time they get in a group of two or more.It's written fairly well, though I did notice a few typos. I think the series really takes off once the books get a bit longer but the earlier ones are basically just children's books with fun magic stuff. It was a rather tedious read (and that 2-and-a-half hour long film was dire) but I still don't hate Harry Potter or the world in general, so it's still going well."},

When you do all the groundwork in the first novel, why cover the exact same territory yet again? The book adds little to the world-building and I am left questioning the limitations and ways in which the magic in Harry Potter's world actually works. What distinguishes 'good magic' from 'bad magic'? What stops anyone simply casting a spell? I know that the spells end up going wrong without practice but there really aren't a lot of procedures or ideas in these books that explain any of that to me.So my 'review' here will stand as a brief examination of how I've found the first two books in this series. Books that I finally decided to read after a long history of more classic children's novels and fantasy. The question at this point is: why did these books become so popular?Firstly is it the fantasy? I will say that most of the fantasy ideas in these two books are old-hat. Sure there are some new ideas or new ways of using the ideas here and there but on the whole the books are a conglomeration of previous myths, fairytales and folklore. So maybe these books made these ideas more accessible for a whole generation to see how interesting the whole fantasy genre was?Another thought that comes to mind is the whole 'growing up with Harry' method. By which I refer to how Harry Potter ages as his readers age, meaning that. Yet, that said, he lacks any great definition as a character. I'm sorry to anyone who said J.K. Rowling was a brilliant prose author - yes I see her moments from time to time but on the whole she spends her novel writing so sparsely and telling her readers so much about her characters that I just wish she would spend some time 'showing' now and then. Which leads me to one other point: marketing. Which is why I was so skeptical about these novels for so long. I looked at the craze surrounding them and thought: it seems like some fad of marketing. And reading these, trying to be critical, I would agree. The plotting is messy (which may be better in the films, but again I haven't seen those because I tend to read the books first), the characterization and development isn't great in the first two books and most of the ideas are sourced from elsewhere. So my conclusion stands that these books became so popular because they were a whole new line of 'popular fantasy' (and the movies helped too). It's the same thing I see happening with Game of Thrones and what I saw happen with Hunger Games and Divergent (though I like Hunger Games a little more).Anyway, that's enough from me. At least until I finish A Dance with Dragons and can complain about that instead. Although my complaining is happy complaining, if that makes any sense. The kind of complaining where I'm trying to let people know why I don't think it's as good as popularity demands..."},

Harry always chooses to remain at Hogwarts during vacation breaks. The DursleyU+2019s send Harry a pathetic Christmas present every year U+2014 how do they get their package to him? I certainly cannot imagine the DursleyU+2019s using owls. Likewise, Hermione left behind her copy of Hogwarts: A History at home because there was no room in her trunk U+2014 LockhartU+2019s books took up so much space! If the DursleyU+2019s can send Harry small parcels, why couldnU+2019t HermioneU+2019s Muggle parents have sent the book to her? (Plot-wise, I understand why this option wasnU+2019t explored, but it does make me wonder how Muggle families communicate with their kids at Hogwarts.)(2) Some of the Hogwarts staff are OLD: Hagrid was 13 when the Chamber of Secrets was opened. This book takes place 50 years later so Hagrid is 63. Likewise, Dumbledore is OLD too. Dumbledore was already on staff at Hogwarts (as the Tranfiguration teacher) when those events 50 years prior took place took place U+2014 he is much older than 63.(3) Dobby, Draco Malfoy, and the Chamber of Secrets: IU+2019m still not 100% sure what Dobby would have ever overheard about the Chamber of Secrets to cause him to try to prevent Harry from returning to Hogwarts. Dobby says that Harry will be in U+201Cmortal dangerU+201D (16) and that there is a plot U+201Cto make most terrible things happen at HogwartsU+201D (16). Dobby also says that he has known about the plot for months.Also, when Chamber of Secrets related messages were painted on the castle walls, Malfoy already seemed to be in the loop about them and also was not concerned for his own safety. Yes, the Chamber of Secrets is a legend, so perhaps Malfoy already had heard about it, but yet the students in the History of Magic class taught by Professor Binns were so keen to have him relate the story to them.But back to DobbyU+2026 What kind of conversation took place at the Malfoy Manor over the summer to have caused Dobby to try to prevent Harry Potter from returning to Hogwarts? I donU+2019t even understand why Dobby felt Harry was in mortal danger. House-elves have magic all of their own so maybe Dobby could read between the lines and figure some stuff out that I havenU+2019t even figured yet?(4) Moaning Myrtle is a ghost: Yes, we all know that. Even though I just finished reading SorcererU+2019s Stone, I canU+2019t recall if Moaning Myrtle was mentioned in the first book. Regardless, Moaning Myrtle is a GHOST. 50 years prior, the basilisk killed Myrtle. Myrtle says that she floated away but then came back and that she U+201Cwas determined to haunt Olive HornbyU+201D (page 299).I got the impression (perhaps from Order of the Phoenix) from Sir Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor House, that becoming a ghost after death takes advance planning. Myrtle died unexpectedly, not sure what year she was at Hogwarts, but letU+2019s assume too inexperienced to U+201Cdo the magicU+201D to let herself come back as a ghost. Is MyrtleU+2019s desire (perhaps even when she was still alive) to haunt Olive Hornby enough for Myrtle to have come back as ghost?Perhaps some witches and wizards do U+201Cplan aheadU+201D and become ghosts after their natural lives end. Perhaps for others who die before their time, becoming a ghost is random and spontaneous. Case in point, Professor Bins (History of Magic teacher) is said to have died in the teacherU+2019s lounge but simply rose up from his chair (as a ghost) and continued to go about teaching his classes. Also, Myrtle mentions to Harry that if he had died in the Chamber of Secrets, she would have shared her toilet with him (326). Perhaps Myrtle was just hoping this random becoming-a-ghost thing would happen with Harry if he had died.(As a side note, it is interesting to note that it seems that Myrtle did not tell anyone that Hermione, Harry, and Ron were brewing polyjuice potion in her bathroom. Myrtle seems quite lonely so perhaps she enjoyed their presence even though a lot of times the three of them just ignored her.)(5) Awards: After the Chamber of Secrets ordeal, in McGonagallU+2019s office, Dumbledore says that Ron and Harry will both receive Special Awards for Services to the School (331). In all seven books, there is never any description of any kind of awards ceremony. Perhaps Dumbledore merely makes these award announcements in the Great Hall at meal times U+2014 or maybe a proper awards ceremony is held each year but Rowling chooses not incorporate it into the stories. (And letU+2019s not forget, that during one detention supervised by Filch, Ron had to polish the silver in the trophy room. (118))I have to say, I am VERY MUCH enjoying my re-read of the entire series and look forward to starting Order of the Phoenix later, but for me, Chamber of Secrets is not as excellent as SorcererU+2019s Stone, mainly because of my thoughts for item (3).all my reviews can be found at www.isniffbooks.wordpress.comre-read from July 22, 2015 - July 29, 2015."},

And in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the much anticipated sequel to the award-winning Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, he is in terrible danger indeed. As if it's not bad enough that after a long summer with the horrid Dursleys he is thwarted in his attempts to hop the train to the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to begin his second year. But when his only transportation option is a magical flying car, it is just his luck to crash into a valuable (but clearly vexed) Whomping Willow. Still, all this seems like a day in the park compared to what happens that fall within the haunted halls of Hogwarts. Chilling, malevolent voices whisper from the walls only to Harry, and it seems certain that his classmate Draco Malfoy is out to get him. Soon it's not just Harry who is worried about survival, as dreadful things begin to happen at Hogwarts. The mysteriously gleaming, foot-high words on the wall proclaim, \"The Chamber of Secrets Has Been Opened. Enemies of the Heir, Beware.\" But what exactly does it mean? Harry, Hermione, and Ron do everything that is wizardly possible--including risking their own lives--to solve this 50-year-old, seemingly deadly mystery. This deliciously suspenseful novel is every bit as gripping, imaginative, and creepy as the first; familiar student concerns--fierce rivalry, blush-inducing crushes, pedantic professors--seamlessly intertwine with the bizarre, horrific, fantastical, or just plain funny. Once again, Rowling writes with a combination of wit, whimsy, and a touch of the macabre that will leave readers young and old desperate for the next installment."},

Don't let that put you off from reading this book. It is a very palatable book, exceptionally easy to read and \"get into\" and hard to put down! Rowling's style is a bit formulaic, but it's a formula that works!Once again, this book explores the differences between good and evil, further examining free will and free choice versus destiny. It's a great children's book that teaches children that they can choose to do the right thing even when they're being pigeonholed or pressured into doing the wrong thing.While I haven't read the books (or seen the movies) before, it seems to me that several items of interest were dropped in this book, or at least hinted at.

And so, Tom Riddle wrote his memory in a diary so he can lead the people that has found his diary in the future to open up the Chamber of Secrets once again which happen to be Ginny Weasley. Four of the mudblood including Hermione Granger and a cat which is Filch's cat has been petrified after seeing a basilisk through a reflection. Harry then learned that a basilisk is hidden in the Chamber of Secrets and is travelled using the pipe so that's why he can heard a sound that others can't. He also learned that the basilisk can kill people when a person looked it into its eye which Moaning Myrtle has when she was alive during Tom Riddle's time. "},

They're really horrible people! Harry misses his school and his friends and he is disheartened to find that neither Ron nor Hermoine have written to him. He feels as though what happened last year was nothing but just a dream; a dream he wishes to relive again. Little did he know, it was the work of an elf named Dobby who is here to warn him and try to stop Harry from returning to Hogwarts as Harry will encounter danger in this new year and Dobby does not want that. Honestly listening to Dobby's voice being narrated in the audiobook was amazing. Regardless with all these warnings from Dobby, Harry manages to return back to Hogwarts by the rescue from the Weasely's and their flying car! I loved that scene in the movie and re-imagining it again was amazing. Not forgetting their journey to Hogwarts in the flying car and almost getting killed!Upon their grand arrival at Hogwarts, they're warned for breaking the rules and what not and they meet their new Defence Against The Dark Arts, Professor Lockhart. I absolutely hated him and he was so phony! Like I could see through him right from the start. Hated that douche bag! All his miserable attempts at teaching in his lesson was hilarious too! All the warnings from Dobby turned out to be true when there are people getting frozen and the cat being frozen as well. I just wonder how does Harry have such great guts to face such horrible creatures and mysteries. I would run away immediately. Maybe that's why I wouldn't end up in Gryffindor. Harry still doubts his placing in Gryffindor. He feels that maybe the sorting hat may have made a mistake in placing him in Gryffindor. But c'mon, we all know that's the right house for Harry. The Parseltongue moment was genius! How the author linked an event from the previous book and made it into something of a greater mystery.

This is the third time IU+2019ve read the book, and the first time IU+2019ve read it out loud to my kids, and it just doesnU+2019t work well. ThereU+2019s too much idiocy, really. The flying car is dumb. Hermione turning into a half-cat is dumb. Gilderoy Lockhart is dumb (though played extremely well by Kenneth Branagh in the movie). Aragog, the big blind spider, is dumb. And even Dobby is dumb long before he becomes interesting.For all these reasons the book feels outside the Potter universe. Almost everything in the other book makes sense to me, but this one is bizarre. What makes it worth reading, despite its dumbness, are the bits and pieces that hint at the world we'll see in the future: the introduction of Dobby and the house elves, the first taste of Tom Riddle, the beginning of the long road of love for Ginny and Harry, the naming of Azkaban as a prison that evokes terror, and the introduction of the surprisingly important Moaning Myrtle set us up for what's to come. Yes itU+2019s a crummy book, but it's not horrible. And kids love it, so that's gotta be worth more than one star (but only just)."},

To be good, a story needs depth and in order to gain depth the writer must come up with enough background either to the characters individually and to the story itself. I am sure this series could have gone down hill with no more than three books had the author not perceived it needed to be matured; young kids who had read and been enchanted by Sorcerer's Stone would get older, so the story had to get a few darker shades in order to keep up with their aging, otherwise audience would decline.This book provides enough background for a second book, making you feel like reading more. Of course we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione back together at Hogwarts, but it's not all happiness and welcoming friends anymore. The Chamber of Secrets already at its beginning sends us a clear message: everything is different and there is real danger around. Most of the danger is caused by intangible old magic. After a very clever fashion, Rowling gives hints to what the story would become years later, as we see Harry and his friends discovering some of the dark past of some characters and of Hogwarts itself. Some of the messages seen in the first book are reinforced, like the value of friendship and power of loyalty, but other than that this book is much more complex, dark and mature.I won't spend much effort trying to explain anything down to details, since pretty much everyone that hasn't been living under a rock knows most of the story. Instead, I will just cover a few points which I really enjoyed and which I didn't like that much while reading The Chamber of Secrets. First of all, despite the new shadowy atmosphere provided by the whole reopening of the Chamber of Secrets situation, Hogwarts felt a lot more real and familiar here than in Sorcerer's Stone. Part of it is due to the fact that, at some point, the fear of being attacked by the mysterious monster that was roaming around was so strong that everyone got closer to each other. There were lots of scenes describing people chatting on the common rooms, having snacks together; it felt cozy and warm, despite the palpable danger. The other aspect that I liked was how difficult the author made every part of the investigation Harry, Ron and Hermione were running in order to find out the truth about the heir of Slytherin. The fact that they had to work for months on the Polyjuice potion only enriched the story; made it more real - in most books about witches they just flick their wands and everything happens.I've been trying to think about the negative aspects, anything that I don't like about The Chamber of Secrets. The only thing that comes to my mind, though, is the same complaint that would come from Ronald Weasley: spiders. I also suffer from arachnophobia, so those chapters full of spiders were a real pain for me to read without having to check every corner of my room every five seconds. Overall, though, this book is flawless.  Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review:  It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."},

In this world Harry Potter is a young wizard of 12,studying at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his friends Ron and Hermione.In \"Chamber of Secrets\" everything we know and love about this world,and especially Hogwarts is changed.And this change begins with the arrival of Dobby the House Elf.Now, this right here is a sign of a brilliant imagination.What, you think elves are pretty easy to imagine when you think of fantasy books?No,this is different.I can't stress enough how much I love Rowling's characters,but it's the weirdest feeling ever,feeling that each and everyone of them can be 100% real and alive.The same applies for Dobby the House Elf.He has a personality,a certain attitude and certain traits.Plus he has his own story(revealed later in the book).These details make the world even more real. Then we have an amazing scene with a flying car,come on,a flying car!It is a dream coming true!Then a wonderful,wonderful,wonderful look at the Burrow,Ron's home.The Burrow.This is everybody's dream house.Don't even fight me with that.Housework done by magic,magical radio and news,degnoming gardens,living with the Weasleys,planning pranks with the twins,making Percy's life a misery,collecting Muggle stuff with Mr Weasley,playing Quidditch at the fields.This life could be wonderful! Then we have some hardcore fantasy were the amazing J.K Rowling actually has created a whole network for travelling from place-to-place.I want to spare you the fun so I'm not telling how they travel but it's pure gold!Then Diagon Alley once again stands as the most magical location on earth.The eye for detail makes you smell the air in the streets of the alley,makes you feel like it can really be true. I can go on and on forever with all the wonderful details and so,but now is time to talk about the main plot in \"Chamber of Secrets\".This Harry Potter book,like actually all of them,feels weirdly like a mystery novel.A threat is released in Hogwarts,a threat that no one really knows what it is,but that causes serious trouble,attacking students and causing panic.No one is safe,as long as the culprit behind these attacks is caught.Things go out of order,the students' lives are threatened,someone has to act,otherwise the school will be closed forever. And then we know who is responsible for all this.The Heir of Slytherin.And here is were the adventure takes flight!Our heroes go in search for the heir,try to solve the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets,not at all wanting to do so.But things move in mysterious ways,causing them to act this way. A thrilling adventure,once again in the familiar grounds of Hogwarts.But Hogwarts is no longer safe.Hogwarts is at its darkest.Yet,it feels great being back!Quidditch matches,magical classes,a duelling club,a deathday party,nigth adventures and a great mystery synthesize the atmosphere of this book and form a completely magical story. It feels great being back,I really can't get enough of this world,I miss it tremendously,I miss the characters and the locations and I really can't get enough of Harry's adventures in the Wizarding World.Every reread is a new experience!"},

The are as always the \"hidden\" lessons that we can learn with these books.I thinks I will repeat this for all the illustrated books but the pictures are STUNNING!!! Some of them are so colorful that is pure joy.All those spiders gave me nightmares but that's fine, means that they were really well made, I guess lolI only wanted a full page portrait of Tom Riddle which I hope I can find one day or another...Do I have to wait another full year before the next one?[We explore a new dark part of the Hogwarts past, where the Chamber of Secrets had been opened, someone was expelled and worst of all, someone died.Now looks like this is going to happen again, and that's why Harry, Ron and Hermione are trying in any way possible (even with Polyjuice Potion) to find more about what happened and most important who's behind all the mess that's happening at school, meanwhile they continue with their normal school activities.Harry discovers that he is a Parselmouth thanks to Lockhart and his Duelling Club -even if for the rest of the school he is now the number one suspect.After putting the pieces together it's time to go and find the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets and find who's behind all of this, but first of all to save Ginny, who's missing and a creepy message about her was found in the corridor.With Hermione petrified, Harry and Ron go into the Chamber with the one and only Gilderoy Lockhart.

I didnU+2019t realize how enraged he could get because he doesnU+2019t have that portrayal in the movie and I found that super interesting. Hermoine is also getting to me a bit, I must admit.

It is sometimes splashed across entire pages or integrated with the text, but never intrusive. The illustrations only enhance the story and are a treat to view. I refused to peek ahead so I would be surprised. And I surely was surprised, starting with the table of contents which was crawling with life-like spiders. I'm a bit phobic of spiders, you see, and there were many of them in this book. I'm sure I'll see them in my dreams or should I say my nightmares? But there were many more illustrations to savor that were atmospheric or dramatic, or captured the essence of each character at any particular moment in time. One of my favorites was a very intuitive sketch of Draco on page 45 that showed not only a hint of malice, but a hint of vulnerability that elicited sympathy from me. Now that's artistic talent! As for the story, I enjoyed accompanying Harry as he began his second year at Hogwarts where he encountered a challenging mystery threatening people's lives along with the very existence of Hogwarts. This second year at school was a trying one for Harry, even before he headed off for classes due to the Dursleys determination to make him miserable over vacation. Most children wish for a break from school, but not Harry since Hogwarts is the closest thing to what he can call a home. He made many friends there his first year, but also enemies, it's clear, when he returns. And he learned a lot in his first year, especially about friendship, but during his second year, he learned even more, though not all of his lessons were learned in the classroom. In fact, his most important lesson his second year had nothing to do with defense against the Dark Arts or potion mixing. Instead, it came from Dumbledore himself when he told Harry, \"It is our choices that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" Along the way, Harry also learned about goodness, loyalty, courage, trust, patience, and tolerance, not to mention disappointment, prejudice, cowardice and the many forms in which evilness can masquerade. I wonder what Harry and his friends will learn in their third year. And I wonder what exciting illustrations Jim Kay will come up with to enrich their story. I intend to find out, same time next year. See you then! "},

The Sorcerer's Stone was still finding its feet, and poor Emma acted like she was reciting lines for a school play. The second was where everything really began to come together, cementing its place as a multi-million-dollar franchise. Of course, the film producers couldn't have done squat if the source material wasn't fantastic to begin with. The Chamber of Secrets may be my second least-favorite Harry Potter book (that honor goes to the Philosopher's Stone), but it's still caviar as far as books go.Now onto the next one.

Subtle, J.K....Diving into book number two after finishing the Philosopher's Stone was so easy. The progression between the first two novels is fantastic - they have a similar tone and pacing, the length is very reasonable and isn't daunting. Unlike the last four books in the series, the first three feel like reads you could pick up and peruse whenever - they don't seem like such a commitment. I think this is also why these first few books, including Chamber of Secrets, are much more child friendly and appropriate. They capture the audience attention right from the beginning and keep a consistent pace which enables even those with short attention spans to become engrossed in the magical world of Hogwarts.U+201CIt is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.U+201DMy poor memory should not be an indication that this book was somehow less of a piece of the Harry Potter universe. It still stands on itU+2019s own. I appreciate it for the nuances of Dobby created to stop Harry from returning to Hogwarts, Hagrid, Dumbledore, and McGonagall were reaffirmed as good characters, Snape was Snape (I donU+2019t think we get a real sense of him until later). The point is, Year Two at Hogwarts is just as important as Year One, and just as important as Year Seven.Again, like with my re-reading of book 1, I found myself forgetting how much humor was in this. Everything from Moaning Myrtle, to RonU+2019s broken wand (and slug curse), to all things Gilderoy Lockhart, had me laughing out loud. However, it was so interesting for my adult self to re-read and make all the connections in the world to book 7. This had to be the one book loaded with the most foreshadow. Everything from horcruxes, to hints of VoldemortU+2019s history, to Harry/Voldemort connections is here in this one. And again, IU+2019m awestruck at the level in which Rowling had the whole series mapped out.Review updated on September 30th, 2015.Visit my website HERE for full detailed review & discussion!"},

I'm not trying to exaggerate, not at all, but it's true. A high percentage of my generation will always be enthralled by the tales, of the young wizard with the oddly shapped mark on his forehead, no matter how many years will pass. Harry Potter is and always will be a cultural figure, a phenomenon, and for many the reason they start reading books.I still remember the day i got this one in my hands. It was 14th July of 2000 and i had my birthday, finally turning 9. My parents had arranged a big party in our new house and everyone was having fun. I was in my room playing with my friends when my Godmother came in bearing gifts. Clothes -meh-, gameboy cassettes -score- and a book -hmm-. That was't weird, i was always a keen reader even in my younger years, but this book was something else. I hadn't read the first one in the series yet but i didn't encountered a problem understanding the story. I started reading and reading and couldn't stop, not even to eat or sleep. I finished it in a day and a half, and after that i was forever a Potterhead.The Chamber of Secrets is my favorite of the series along with the Goblet of Fire. I have read them both countless times, i can still recite big chunks out of them, or remember the exact pages my favorite scenes are in. Nowdays the same books stand in my bookcase with somewhat broken spines, looking proudly well-read and reminding me what a great story should be like.Every character, every situation, every moral conundrum or ethical kerfuffle, every little detail, is so well thought out and brilliantly moulded that certainly blows your mind away. For me Hogwarts is an extended home and Harry, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and even Snapeare a part of me. I'm very proud of them, and i'm absolutely sure they will always be a few of my favorite characters."},

The base story is already familiar to me since I've seen the movies. While the first followed the movie plot line closely, I noticed little scenes and extras in this book that didn't make their transfer to film. As before, Harry starts in the house of horrors, aka the Dursley residence, where they treat the kid so poorly I'm surprised he doesn't lose it and become an evil wizard himself. I can totally understand his desire to go to Hogwarts and escape that household, as morbidly amusing as it is (and it DOES make a good opening to these novels). Hogwarts was already fleshed out fully in 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone', but the charm and magic of the series came further alive in this second installment. It seems that Rowland has become more comfortable with writing itself, something that's hard for me to put a finger on exactly, but it's felt all the same. This book just read better, the previous mild cheese coating dusted away, leaving a fun joy behind. It's not all happiness and games, however; what good story would be? There's a darkness lurking around the corner and a mystery to solve.First, the professor Gilderoy Lockheart. The new Dark Arts teacher is introduced to this series, bringing numerous hilarious scenes that worked perfectly. What fun it is to follow the three kids through their classes - the clueless and boastful professor is a contrast to the experiences in the classroom of the slithering Snape who seems to have it against the kids. Hogwarts itself has such a strong presence in the novels - from the teachers, the classes, the studied subjects, Dumbledore, Hagrid and his cottage of tea and bizarre animals, that creepy Forbidden Forest with giant critters that nightmares are made of....and now let's throw in secrets passages and riddles and secret diaries. If that doesn't make a workable magical concoction, then I don't know what does.Since I'd experienced the story celluloid style, it held little surprise. I'm sure if I were naive going in, I'd have been surprised at the twist with the riddle for Tom Riddle, the discovery of the creature waiting in the bowels of the school, and the small twists that came about, but it was still a joy to experience in written form even if I knew the waiting answers. Pacing is kept up strong - you'd think it may be dull to spend so much time in a classroom, but not at all, for it unfolds naturally, applying in various ways to not only the main story of the Chamber, but to small details of the characters lives that will continue enriching the series.Harry is a wonderful protagonist - he's reasonable and decent but still a typical type of wizard kid willing to break small rules all for a spot of fun or dire circumstances. Ron is humorous without meaning to be, that unfortunate type who has bad luck and circumstance but shines with their general personality, and of course Hermione is a great confidante and friend you like to have around, especially when you aren't sure of the right curse to muster or potion to mix.Definitely recommended, hard to put down, I enjoyed this one more than the first. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone wasn't bad, but something felt awkward to me, kind of like the beginning of one those odd school moments where teachers are trying to get kids to learn lame square dancing and then sectioning the kids into gender to dance together. I'm happy to say that awkwardness isn't present in Chamber of Secrets, and the heart of the series has started beating harder - it's not possible for me not to continue this series now. Let the magic continue!"},

Rowling continues Harry's quest to become the best wizard he can be at Hogwarts alongside his two best friends, Ron and Hermione. Great (though not beautiful or superbly sophisticated) writing, smart development of characters, and a clever plot with laud-worthy foreshadowing motivate me to give this second installment five stars. One aspect of the book I loved was how Rowling built Harry's numerous conflicts. There was internal conflict (which house does Harry really belong in?), external conflict with other individuals (darn the Malfoy family and all of Slytherin) and external conflict with society (everyone suspecting Harry of being the heir of Slytherin). When all of these clashes are resolved by the end of the book it brings a strong feeling of satisfaction to those who empathize with Harry, the underdog from the start. Not to mention that I saw none of the plot twists coming - that shows how even adults can attain entertainment from this series, even if they have more foresight than I do. The quote I included above also exemplifies this book's appeal to all readers; it's a crosscutting theme amongst all ages that our actions make us who we are, not just what we're given by biology or God or whatever you believe in.Everyone tells me that these books get more and more enthralling as they progress. If so, Harry Potter may become one of my favorite series of all time. Better late than never, right?"},

Forgive me if I leave out any details.I liked it. I liked it quite a bit - maybe not as much as the first one, but I still enjoyed it, nonetheless. This one was without doubt, intenser (is that a word?) than the first, and a mystery begins to reveal itself. Harry, who I felt was slightly underdeveloped in the first novel, is beginning to blossom into an amazing protagonist, Ron and Hermione are just as spectacular as they were in the first book, Draco is as un-spectacular as he was in the first book, and we're introduced to Ginny! I can't wait to see how her character develops throughout the series.      The Plot        U+201CIt is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.U+201D  Harry, Ron, and Hermione are certainly in for an excited second year at Hogwarts! Speaking of which, I never really noticed the ironic name of the school until now. Hogwarts - it's warthog in reverse!I'm so clever...The story takes off as Harry is visited at Privet Drive by a rather pestering house-elf named Dobby, who ceaselessly protests that something dreadful will occur if Harry returns to Hogwarts. Being the persistent (and stubborn) thirteen-year-old that Harry is, he ignores Dobby's warnings and proceeds to the school...by driving Mr. Weasley's magically enhanced, flying car there. Yep, that causes a wee bit of trouble.      U+201COf all the trees we could've hit, we had to get one that hits back.U+201D  But, ladies and gentlemen, that's only the tip of the iceberg. Not only, are students inscrutably being petrified to stone, but after everyone discovers that Harry is a parselmouth (a trait passed on from Salazar Slytherin, that allows you to speak to snakes) he is one of the prime suspects. Furthermore, rumors that the Chamber of Secrets, a mythical room that allegedly holds an appalling beast, may be opening once more...      The Characters  Ah, what more can I say about these characters? I still really really really like them all. Harry's internal and external conflicts and how he deals with them, along with his occasional burst of rage and frustration or dry retorts were more than amusing to read. Hermione's wits and haughtiness was just as perfect as it was in the first book, as was Ron's snappy remarks and bickering with Hermione...my teenage girl romance sensors are tingling.A little more light is shed on Voldemort He-who-must-not-be-named, and it'd be down-right lie for me to say I expected that ending. You know a book is really affecting you, when you shiver just thinking about the antagonist.      What I Loved  -Harry Potter! Yes, yes, yes! The first book was only 300 pages, so I can understand why Harry didn't develop that much, but in Chamber of Secrets, he begins to unravel many of his strengths and flaws.-I still like the characters from the first book, and I really liked Dobby. Hehe, that little house-elf is fantastic. I was laughing so hard every time he tried to save Harry (hence, the quote on the top). Fred and George continued to crack me up, and Ron and Hermione are still perfect for each other.-I loved how Riddle's Diary worked. I don't want to spoil anything, but the purpose it serves to the plot fascinated me!-Quidditch! Or more specifically, Lee Jordan's commentary at the matches. Ha ha.-The writing continues to entertain me, but I do wish there weren't so many dialogue tags with adverbs. But hey, this is a Middle Grade novel - you get what you pay for.-The ending was done much better than Sorcerer's Stone. It was slightly more complex, and interested me more to be perfectly honest.      What I Didn't Love  -Geez, the pacing again! As I just mentioned, the ending was done much better that in the first novel, but the rest of the novel felt much too fast!-I really wanted more Ginny! She really doesn't show up until the end. *sigh*-Where's Dumbledore? I feel like he does nothing throughout the whole book and then just pops in at the end to explain everything to Harry. I really want to see more of him.       Final Thoughts  Upon finishing this book, I was lying awake at 1 in the morning pondering, what's next? If that isn't a clear indicator that I'm officially hooked on this series, then I don't know what is! I never really liked the idea of magic and wizards - I thought it was tacky and frankly, (don't come after me with pitchforks, please.) stupid. These books have surely changed my opinion on that!If you haven't read this series yet, what are you waiting for? Read it! :D"},

Anyway, this is actually my least favorite of the series. I am far, far in the minority on this, but I just find Dobby to be a bit tiresome. I know why people love him, but each time I read this book, I like him a bit less. I did love Snape in this book, though he has a pretty small role in this one. His micro-expressions though... love them. When he finds out a student was taken into the Chamber, and he grips the back of the chair - that can be interpreted in so many ways. That is why I love Snape's character so much - he's not friendly, not likable, not charming... but throughout the whole series, his smallest moves and gestures can be seen to be whatever the viewer projects on them. He's like a blank slate. If you think he's evil, you will see his actions that way. I love that he's willing to walk that line. Also, this is the book that made me love Ron. His reaction when Hermione is attacked, and his slide down the wall when he hears about Ginny, are just perfect. His reaction when Hermione recovers is so adorable and great. It's one of my favorite moments in the book, and it's literally like one sentence long. (I love Ron & Hermione together. Harry and Hermione? No way.) Anyway...

He is honestly one of Rowling's best creations I think, and it doesn't even bother me that Kenneth Branagh now features heavily in my mind whenever I read his scenes, because it was perfect casting in my opinion.What else can I say?

In this book, it's primarily Dobby (a house-elf - and even though I don't like him, I do LOVE the plot-lines that his species opens up later in the series), and Gilderoy Lockhart. By the way - Kenneth Branaugh is brilliant as Lockhart.Lockhart is the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, a position that he seems to be eminently qualified for. Look, I know a lot of people hate Lockhart, I do too, actually, but I love to hate him. Seriously love it. He's a fantastic character, even though he is a prat, or maybe because he is.Confession 2: I'm not the biggest Ginny fan. Especially not here in the beginning. I feel for her, but the hero-worship...Ugh. Thankfully that doesn't last much beyond this book.But there are so many things that I enjoy here, too!1. Peskipiksi Pesternomi2. Potion brewing in the bathroom3. Hermione 4. Dueling Club - 5. Fawkes!6. Dwarves dressed as \"Cupids\" to deliver Valentines7. The thought of asking Snape for a love-potion!8. Harry's Valentine9. The MysteryThe mystery is actually quite good - something I've finally been able to realize and acknowledge on this last re-read. It unravels quite beautifully, and with an awesome amount of building suspense. Now, onto one of my absolutely favorites: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. YES!Review also available at The Book EatersPrevious review:I've gotta be honest. This was always my least favorite book, ever since the first time I read it. But on this re-read, I was enchanted, enthralled and left wondering what the hell my problem was previously.Once again I have no hope of doing a review of this book justice.On to my favorite in the series: Prisoner of Azkaban!!

After reading (and enjoying) the first book some days ago (and just about ten years too late), my expectations for this second book were probably too high, as it is often the case with second installments in a series.J.K. Rowling delved deeper into the world of Harry Potter, his friends and his enemies, but in the end, I felt as if we didn't learn many new things about this world. Apart from some very interesting bad-ass moments, the character development lacked some of its profound depth from the first book and ultimately made me consider the book as a transition phase between Harry Potter as a child and a teenager.However, don't you think I didn't enjoy or like it! It was still a great book, a magical world, an exciting plot, but its flaws emerged a little bit more apparently and were unable to fulfil my expectations in their entirety. Draco Malfoy continues to be annoying, not because of the character's annoying appearances, but because of his character traits being nearly non-existing. It can be argued that it is difficult to create full characters out of children, but J.K. Rowling succeeded with trying this procedure with Harry, Ron, Hermione and even Ginny, so why not with Draco? Hopefully, his character is going to be explored in more profundity during the other novels.It seems like I keep defending my relatively low rating of this novel, but Goodreads describes a three-star-rating as 'liked it', and I absolutely did. It simply was no 'really liked it' or 'it was amazing', so I will lower my expectations a little bit and hope to be able to award five stars again after reading the next book.When I'm 80 years old and sitting in my rocking chair, I'll be reading Harry Potter. And my family will say to me, 'After all this time?' And I will say, 'Always.'Isn't this a lovely statement? Sources say Alan Rickman created this quote, but others insist on the quote being misattributed, so I'll just leave it at that and turn to the third novel of the Harry Potter series."},

I always wondered what spurred his hatred for muggle-borns and this book really clarified that question for me.And now, rather than seeing Voldemort as this all-powerful evil wizard, I just view him more as a tragic character who had such a potential to truly be the greatest wizard in the world that he so wished to be, but because of his past and his choices, it twisted him and transformed him into the very epitome of evil starting at such a young age.I loved this book so much more than the first!

The last chapters of the book are the best, in my opinion.One of the things I enjoy most about these books is how easy it is to read it, how simple the story seems when at the same time is so complex and even though the plot focuses on one thing, as its title says, I think the writer manages to play many different topics as well, without changing the main point       U+201CHearing voices no one else can hear isn't a good sign, even in the wizarding world.U+201D  I love   Ron and Hermione alike, their personalities are so different and somehow have managed this beautiful friendship.

And how that will influence their relationships and their lives, their families and Hogwarts.I'm excited. :)  Hagrid and Dumbledore are still my favorites when I read it , I think they have the most interesting parts of the plot even though they are minor characters, they are always involved in some way.Hagrid is an adorable and funny character, he's always getting into trouble xD. Dumbledore continues to have the best lines in history, with his great wisdom and kindness has earned a place in my heart :).I'm still not sure about   Ginny, not even what her rol in the plot and although this time has had a very important role, her personality makes me a little upset, I don't know, maybe become a character stronger with time, but still don't know how I feel about her. Her complete obsession with Harry it was for me at times a little creepy, it's a girl and she is in love , I know that, but at times the writer describes her , and I imagine a stalker (?. I said it.So this is getting better for my guys, so no doubt, I'll continue with the saga :D. I am increasingly excited about what will happening :)"},

Granted, his fame obsession and ludicrous self-absorption make for some amusing Rowling-esque moments that make the series good (such as a dozen Lockharts running for cover in the photo frames with rollers in their hair), but at the expense of the reader's patience. This degree of narcissism, even if plausible in the real world, stretches my suspension of disbelief too far. Like every page with Malfoy on it, I'd rather flip past them than read them. The greatest problem I have with this series is the two dimensional villains (or irritating Defense Against the Dark Arts teachers). Good villains should draw out some sort of sympathy in the reader, or reveal at some point their humanity. At the very least, you should be able to understand why they are the way they are, and that back story allows you to look at them from a different perspective. This moment never happens for Lockhart, and incidentally it never happens for Malfoy. Rowling allowed the perfect opportunity to make Malfoy a good, three dimensional villain when Harry and Ron used the Polyjuice potion. For the first time, we had Malfoy out of the public eye and in private, where we could see the real him, and not the front everyone else sees. Here was the chance to see his humanity U+2013 that heU+2019s such a prick because heU+2019s afraid of disappointing his father, that he worries about his grades, that thereU+2019s a girl he likes and heU+2019s secretly worried she doesnU+2019t like him back, anything that humanizes him and draws out some sympathy, because thus far heU+2019s gotten nothing more than eye rolls out of me. But we didnU+2019t get that moment. Rowling wrote him no differently than she does when he is on parade in front of everyone, which was really a shame.

The second is the character of Tom Riddle and all the scenes involving him.Since I am reading all the books in direct sequence, the events and characters of each book blend together pretty fast, so I will probably do a more detailed series review at the end.For now, all there is to say is that I am actually enjoying Harry Potter.

I don't know why I'd bother myself trying to figure out what are the flaws of the book and I enjoyed myself so much reading it.I'm not one of those people who try to find every needle in a haystack. I can be satisfied with imperfection, and that's not at all imperfect. It met all of my standards I had set after reading the first book. It was adventurous and the world grows more and more complex, just like I wanted it to be. Learning more about magic, was just as wondrous and exciting as it was for Harry, Hermione and Ron and all those other kids at Hogwarts. I almost feel like I'm a student there, which I wish I were. Take out the Basilisk & Voldemort though because I'd shit my pants. Not that the kids weren't afraid. Of course, they were and that makes it that much more real. The kids have a magnet for trouble. It's so deep, it is a book any kid should be reading instead of reading and obsessing about instead of playing pc games all day and night long. I'll be careful enough to teach my kids how to read and appreciate what books give to us. I love that in the end Harry stands alone and face the enemies without the immediate help of Ron & Hermione. They help him along the way, and that's just as important. It was such a great read and writing this after almost 1 year I feel so drawn to just pick up the book and reread it."},

Well, I felt that way before starting this, but I can definitely say that Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter series!And while I will admit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor, I still enjoyed it a great deal. I think the reason for my not liking it as much can be mostly credited to the introduction of a new character, Professor Lockhart. Lockhart is an annoyingly pretentious wizard who is completely full of himself, and the majority of his teachings were based on his own life and his supposed brushes with death that he escaped only because of his \"heroism\" and great knowledge of the magic arts. (view spoiler)[Riiiiiiiiight. (hide spoiler)]In a summary, I didn't find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harry's realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at Hogwarts.But HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders - not to mention the lovely cast of characters - to more than compensate for this particular installment's slightly lacking plot.

Before he gets there though he had to fight the depression from loneliness as his adopted family does not care about him much and his Hogwarts friends seemingly forgotten about him. Fortunately a magical creature called Dobby shows up and instantly makes Harry's life full of excitement: he is convinced Harry's life is forfeit if the latter goes to Hogwarts, so Dobby makes everything in his power to stop Harry from doing this. Injures and maiming are fair game as long as Harry remains alive. To add to the fun it seems Harry's life as well as that of his friends might really be in danger Dobby hinted at. Like the first one, this book can still fully qualify as a children book however it is darker and it does have some very gloomy and depressing moments; children grew up and matured a little and so is the tale. We get to meet characters familiar from the first book and see their development as well as new interesting ones. Speaking about new people, Gilderoy Lockhart is so full of himself he is excellent. His whole Valentine celebration made me laugh out loud. I think this is the first time we get to meet Lucius Malfoy in person - he is another interesting guy; the last scene with him is excellent. I would like to talk about Harry Potter a little. I saw lots of people say he is not the main hero of the series; he is just a guy who always gets either lucky, or have a helpful friend handy in tight spots. I saw Hermione named the main hero - she is the brainpower behind Harry's successes most of the time. I saw Neville named the main hero - he has the greatest and most unexpected development of all characters. I would respectfully disagree: Harry Potter is the main hero albeit a reluctant one (compare him to Lockhart to see why). For the proof of this look no further than the final confrontation in this novel. This was my reread of the book; I knew exactly what to expect and I was sure I would rate it with 4 stars until I found myself awoke well in the early morning hours finishing this reread despite the fact that I had to wake up early. Any book which can do it to me deserves 5 stars. I do not have anything else to add to what I already said; each installment of the series was analyzed and reviewed countless number of times by better qualified people. I will stop right here."},

Oh little did I know about the happiness I feel when I read about Harry and his friends and little am I expecting what is coming up.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets stars off where Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone left off. Harry goes back to his old home for summer and spends time with his ugly family, The Dursleys. They are no different then they were before but in fact are even more rude. As Harry thinks about going back to Hogwarts, a new and ugly creature appears in Harry's bedroom as Harry returns upstairs. His name is Dobby and he is known as a house-elf, one that is treated badly. But Dobby didn't come to chat with Harry, he came to warn him. Warn him about Hogwarts and save him, telling him he must not return to Hogwarts. He says this because he is trying to warn Harry and tell him that he can put the whole school in danger including his friends and himself. But because Harry does not listen and is actually able to go back to Hogwarts thanks to his best friend Ron, a lot of things happen this second year and some aren't the best. Some include agony being made and being taken back in time, a new professor named Gilderon Lockheart, a spirit/ghost who died in Hogwarts and now haunts the girls bathroom named Moaning Myrtle, and even events having to do with Ron Weasley's younger sister, Ginny. These aren't the only events happening and the only ones making Hogwarts suffer. They actually have nothing to do with it. There is somethingU+2014or maybe someoneU+2014who is leading Hogwarts to danger and putting everyone at risk. This person, or thing, is turning students into stone, writing on the walls, and killing a professor's cat. As rumors spread, nobody knows who this might be. It might be Draco Malfoy, since he is known as an evil child wizard in Slytherin, or maybe Hagrid, since he has been in Hogwarts for a very long time, including his studying years there. Or any other professor, including Snape, Dumbledore, McGonagall, or even Lockhart. But if it isn't any of those, then it might just be Harry himself.I really don't know what to say. Words aren't possible because this book was just so wonderful and so fun. There were even more magical journeys and I was so glad everyone has changes and J.K. Rowling decided to changer everyone's character. Well, almost. Where do I start? Harry is still the cute cinnamon roll and I love his precious and cute character. I hate how he had to suffer even more with the Dursley's and had to even go back as the second year ended. I hope he escapes one day for good and never returns because I am so tired of him being treated like shit and like he really does not exist. His family is the only family he really has, yet they treat him like they wish he was dead and didn't survive The Chamber of Secrets. Sure, that's what they wish, but they should show a little more empathy with him and treat him a little better, maybe feed him more food and give him better clothes, let him go out with his owl and have some freedom, let him write back to his friends when they know he is miserable with them, and just be the young Harry Potter he was made to be. Other than that, he is growing and growing into a much better wizard and is slowly learning even more spells, which he ended up using some to defend his friend and fight Draco with.Ron, oh Ron he is so cute and precious but so dumb in such cute ways. He still can't figure out the right magic spells and how to use them, making the rest of the crowd laugh at him because of his silly actions. He's so funny and when he's worried, his face reactions are so cute but so heartbreaking at times because he is just so adorable. Draco didn't mock him like he did in the previous book and I was glad for that but he still received laughter from others because of the message he got from his mother, the way he tried learning transfiguration, and for needing his mother to defend him. He isn't learning quick like Harry but I know the time will come and he will become a good wizard and be able to change things into the right objects, be able to drive a flying car correctly, and defend his friend like he defended him when he needed the saving. Hermione was probably my favorite. She has changed so much and isn't a bossy high-top nerd anymore. She's always at the top, able to answer questions before anyone and earning Gryffindor points, and that is the reason I loved her a lot more. What would Gryffindor, Harry, and Ron do without Hermione? Like my friends have said, probably dead or lost because they can't figure out what to do or how things work. She actually breaks rules in this book to help Harry and Ron and is also helping them with the secrets they are trying to discover. She still supports Harry with his Quidditch matches and is there for them when they need help, even when she wasn't supposed to.You might be wondering what the 4 stars mean? Well, like others, Ginny was my least favorite character. I wish she didn't get in the way and wasn't the reason for the secrets, but she was also really dumb. She acted dumb in front of Harry and tried stepping up for him, only embarrassing herself. She was embarrassed by her mom because she was accepted into Gryffindor, but she was still dumb. She didn't have to listen to Riddle and could've made the choice of leaving everything out. Of course, the book would be different and maybe quite boring if it wasn't for her, but I still didn't like her character majority of the time. I hear she's one of the least favorite characters and I can see why. She's pretty annoying and is always blushing when she sees Harry. I'm guessing she likes him? Dobby was not my favorite either, only because he tried telling Harry what to do but at the end, sure, I liked him and was glad he was free because Malfoy was not a good master for him. He kicked and hit him for no reasons, so I'm sure that the reason for his actions when Harry told him to sit.The friendship has definetely grown and Hermione, Ron and Harry are just best friends. They worry about each and everything about them together is just so cute. I will admit that I liked this one a little less than the first one, but just a little bit. I don't use half stars or anything anymore, so don't be thinking the first one was better and this one had its flaws because it really didn't disappoint me. I just hated some characters and that happens in all novels, and Draco is still one of them. He's an asshole, fight me! Like him or not, I feel like I will always hate him. I feel like he will grow out to be just like this father and become an evil wizard like all Slytherins do. I know his appearance won't change and his personality won't either. He treats Harry like shit as well because of who he is and sometimes he thinks he's cool because of his father. But his father is nothing but a lousy and loud man that tries to show off because of his son and because of what he can afford. There was nothing new about him and I hate him for almost everything. Well, everything actually.Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets did not disappoint and left me upset, but it had different flaws than the first one. Bad ones, but I'm sure they'll be fixed sometimes. I just didn't like Dobby at the beginning, but like I said, I was glad he was free at the end and defended Harry from Lucius Malfoy. I know every story has its own improvement and all analyze, but this one might be my least favorite. It's like I see it coming. Overall, I can't wait to see where the next journey takes off and how Harry will escape the Dursley's again."},

But with the new book coming out in a couple of weeks, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as someone who's just getting into Freudian theory.From the very beginning, the true nature of this story is quite obvious - The Chamber of Secrets. There is only one \"chamber of secrets\" that is of any human concern, and it is no coincidence that the book of such a title was written by a woman.By sending her young, immature male character, Harry (whose name, along with Tom and Dick, just happens to be one of the \"universal\" male names) into the mysterious Chamber, Rowling is exploring her memories of early childhood sexuality. The Chamber is filled not only with mystery, but danger and legend - its very existence is debated, which no doubt refers to the elusive female orgasm.Ms. Rowling, whose sexual impulses have no doubt been unfulfilled over the years, is attempting to fulfill them by way of her own fiction. She has created a perfect sexual explorer in Harry Potter - a young, innocent and noble young man whose powers have not yet matured. Obviously a male that Rowling would feel comfortable with. This is especially interesting given the actual resident of the Chamber of Secrets - a huge, deadly serpent. And there's only one thing that a huge, terrible serpent can represent.Rowling's sexual past is the fertile ground in which this book was grown. It is her cathartic attempt to win over the guilty feelings that she's repressed from her former sexual life, the one she regrets more than anything else, by manufacturing a hero. That hero, in Harry Potter, represents the type of man for whom she would \"open\" her \"chamber - pure of heart and noble of intention and, most importantly, under her control. The vanquishing of the serpent-symbol is her victory, leaving her free to explore other aspects of her life, including the eventual resolution of the Electra complex that appears to have been built up around Professor Dumbledore..."},

This saturday, I read this book until 04:30 am and I completely didn't realise that I was reading for 4 hours or so and on that same day I had an economy course with my teacher and I completely forgot about that too until my mom reminded me of it. the course started at 10:00 am o'clock and I woke up at 11:00 am and maybe I'll get into a little bit trouble when I'm coming to school on Monday because of this. But I really couldn't help it! THIS BOOK WAS SO GOOD AND I COULD NOT STOP READING IT!!okay now let's talking about this book!   My Opinionomg! this book! I had a lot of feelings! Anger. Sadness. Happiness and many more and the chapter I most loved was The Duelling Club. it was so funny to see Professor Snape disarmed Lockhart until he was flying because of the impact of Professor Snape's spell hahaha. xDI don't like calling Lockhart a Professor because he clearly didn't know any spells that were usefull for his students or anyone... Maybe just a Memory Charm. but it was only usefull for him to do his nasty business. ugh and he was a liar too. all those books he wrote were all faked. If Hogwarts were real, I would be really happy to learn all about Defence Against The Dark Arts. this is the most interesting subject that have really caught my interest since I began reading the first book. what about you guys? tell me on the comment section below! ^^and that Duelling Club was so amazing! learning how to fight with spells! and what schocked me was that Voldemort was used to be a human! and Voldemort was not his real name. His real name was Tom Marvolo Riddle but he changed it. I mean, not an ordinary human,of course. he was a muggle-born. his father was a muggle and his mother was a witch. I knew he was a Slytherin and he studied at Hogwarts too but I never thought him as muggle-born or a child or a teenager. because he was so evil that I couldn't even imagine what he would look like in the past and he *coughs coughs * used to be handsome...oh! I love Quidditch too! I don't really like sports but it's different with Quidditch. Quidditch is wonderful and amazing! I even always scream like \" YOU CAN DO IT HARRY! YOU CAN CATCH IT!\" and when Gryffindor wins I always scream like \" YAY!! GRYFFINDOR! GRYFFINDOR! \" Am I weird? hahaaha. AHHH. I wish Hogwarts were real. I wish I were at least a muggle-born. I have only read two books in Harry Potter series but they already have changed my life. thank you guys for reading and liking this review! I hope you guys have a great day and Happy Reading!!

They try to carry out their plans about the clue that left behind. I enjoyed watching the way they solve the problem and while they're conducting something, Ron is the one that always made me laugh out loud. Hermione is the brain of this group, though, she's smart and subtle. And Harry is the brave one, although he is so scared about the whispers, he drives into the pipe without hesitation in the end. I really adored him !This book is entertaining for many reasons. Lockhart is a colorful character, without him, this book will not be complete.

Well....I now know definitively why according to JKR but we had some fun ideas too.For a children's book I can't stress how well thought out all these are and the magical feeling I get when reading one. I'm almost always sad to realize that I'm probably a muggle *gasps* or a squib but either way I don't care I'll always try on occasion to cast a spell...because yes I have a wand and I'm convinced that one day it will work so I just have to keep trying.*wyngardium leviosa*"},

I feel the pressure to put out the best review that I can possibly think of right now...just for her- for her favorite series. The series that got her through the hard times in her life. Books she thinks of as family.I'm not worthy. But I am going to try...Gryffindor- Passionate about their beliefs, and standing up for what they believe in. First to defend their friends. They prefer to deal with a situation directly, even if it means a fight - and they want that fight to be a fair one.Ravenclaw- Defined by curiosity and the love of learning- first and foremost. A Ravenclaw will always seek knowledge. They want to know the why of everything. They love learning, and will want to seek as much knowledge as possible.Hufflepuff- Ultimately, Hufflepuffs are interested in helping both people and animals- much less confrontational or daring than the other houses. They are also the least likely to care about individual achievement or House points- more apt to to focus on their relationships to others rather than things they personally have done.Slytherin- Slytherins are seeking individual greatness, and the dark and mysterious appeals to them greatly, even if it seems dangerous. TheyU+2019ll go for experiences that other houses are too afraid to touch.Which house are you?http://www.allthetests.com/quiz30/qui...Harry has spent another horrible summer dealing with the Dursleys...but hope comes with a rescue from one of his best friends- Ron Weeeeeeeeeasley *said with a squeaky British accent*- and his father's flying car.So in the dead of night- they arrive at Hogwarts- ready for what the year ahead awaits them...As usual I will not give too much away...but excitement lurks behind these pages- for young and old....and I for one (somewhere in the middle)- am looking forward to what comes next.* Even though I like for people to think I fall under the mysterious Slytherin- No matter how much I try- I am still a Hufflepuff at heart...apparently."},

Then why is it the lowest rated of the 7? Why do so many consider it to be their least favorite?I don't know! I thought it was flipping amazing.Why?Because Jo Rowling, so very English and erudite, with her topsy turvy hilarious and creepy narrative, her human characters and her timeless topics; Jo, who knows the human heart like Hermione knows the works of Gilderoy Lockhart, hides the motives of every character till the perfect moment of revelation. Even those that should be above suspicion are not with the taint of pride and ambition, and even the most beloved characters breathe with the fragility of humanity as the story relentlessly runs along through the darkened halls of Hogwarts. Beware, second-year students, the desire to be great is a double-edged sword beset with rubies.I first became a fan of Jo with Cuckoo's Calling and it occurred to me, breathlessly reading through Chamber of Secrets, that the Riddle was solved. Finally. Why is Jo Rowling so good? It's simple. She's a mystery writer.Harry Potter soars above Muggle mystery books because of its special additives. Magic, yes, and undeniably malleable lenient fantasy elements that Jo masterfully weaves and waves her wand over to manipulate and beef up the story as she sees fit, but truly, how many mysteries have we read (collectively) where we set them down and forget who the detective was, or the suspect, or whatever. Why is that? Because of Jo's reverse engineering (no doubt an ancient Slytherin technique) where the character comes first. No matter what, and no matter which character. The books are entirely character driven and because we love The Boy Who Lived and He Who Shall Not Be Named and The Weasleys and Rubeus Hagrid and Ginny (the cutest human being on planet earth) and on and on and on, we find ourselves shoulder to shoulder with our would-be sleuths and puzzle solvers and their \"we must we must\" attitude. Chamber of Secrets was an outstanding mystery, chock-full of red herrings, an incredible combative climax, and too many laugh-out-loud lines to count. Dear Diary, I have a new favorite book.Oh really, what is it?*Throws diary out the window and runs away screaming*And, shivers, at the mere mention of Azkaban, I read Chamber of Secrets with far too much excitement and anticipation, because, knowing I was going into Harry Potter, The Prisoner of Azkaban, following Chamber of Secrets, was the book I was waiting for the most, and for that I blame Gary Oldman. (I am a Sirius fan of Gary Oldman) That said, I had no idea that Chamber of Secrets would be so outstanding and leave me thinking the incredible Philosopher's Stone was a perfectly-pitched welcome handshake compared to the books to come.For those who like to feel up a book for flaws, I have none, and I see none. I see the sheer verve of adventure and the scintillating luster of mystery, gleaming hungry-eyed and ready for more. You see, as Philosopher's Stone was about love, Chamber of Secrets was about fearlessness. Fearlessness to speak the truth in the face of a lie, fearlessness to stand up for what's inside your heart. Fearlessness to take a leap of faith and follow the path of destiny.Also, I am very interested in how the issues gain maturity as Harry and the other characters age. Obviously there are deaths to come, but in the case of Chamber of Secrets versus Philosopher's Stone, I could feel that sense of maturity creeping in just a bit, and am so very excited for the continuation of the series (I'll have to go buy some more chocolate frogs now) as everything in the Wizarding World becomes increasingly dangerous and unhinged and wild and wondrously unforgettable.Recommended for everyone.And 50 points for Hermione for being epic even whilst being petrified."},

When I asked one of my friends why he felt it was the worst of the bunch, he gave me a very reasonable reply.

When I asked one of my friends why he felt it was the worst of the bunch, he gave me a very reasonable reply. He'd come in late on the Potter game, having only read them last year in fact, when a Professor of his was walking them through what it takes to be a good mystery-- using Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone as an example of a perfectly fashioned mystery.Moving on to the second book, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, my friend (let's call him Rex) found that this book wasn't up to standard mystery-wise in the way the first book had been, which is what he'd been expecting. Maybe it's because I first read it as a child, or it's maybe because I was more interested in the fantasy aspect, but I never really cared, nor do I care now that it doesn't follow the same standard mystery guidelines. Rex was the only person who gave me an answer other than \"I don't know, I just don't like it as much,\" so therefore his is the only one that I'm able to analyze. But enough negativity, allow me to explain what I do like about it.Um, Ron's broken wand? Hysterical. Well, if I'm being honest, any single scene including Mr. Ron Weasley is bound to make me smile and any interaction between him and Hermione (yes, even this early on) is bound to make me squee!!!!!!!!!! Notice how quick he is to jump to Hermione's defense; notice how distraught he is over Hermione's being petrified. Oh, how I love them.To add a few more- Harry's first trip to the Burrow! The flying car! Fred and George marching ahead of Harry, announcing him mockingly as the Heir of Slytherin! The singing Valentine's Day Dwarves! And our introduction to the Whomping Willow! Come on people, this is classic stuff!I also love the part Ginny Weasley plays in this book; not so much the whole \"helping the Heir of Slytherin thing,\" but her mad crush on Harry. Maybe because I was granted the fortune/misfortune of having a brother a grade above me, I also had the wonderful fortune/misfortune of crushing on all his super hott (yes with two t's) friends. Ah, how I remember the days of pining for them, of whining over their lack of return interest, of cursing my blasted gapped teeth and frizzy hair. Of course, unlike Ginny I was never able to woo any of them in the end, (even after my braces!) but I still think I did alright as far as men go;)Okay, back to the text. I even enjoy ol' Lockhart, for what he's worth. Yeah, he's obnoxious, but that's the point, right? And yeah, the degree to whch he is obnoxious is a little cartoony and unrealistic, but let's not forget- this is a children's book, after all. Chamber of Secrets also sees Harry destroying his first Horcrux, and offers us our first insight into one Tom Riddle. I would never discount this book, or cast it so carelessly aside as least favorite of the bunch (I don't believe in ranking these books, by the way). Anyway, it receives a full five stars from me with zero hesitation. I appreciate it's contribution to the Potter world and will look forward to reading it again when the time comes...which it will."},
