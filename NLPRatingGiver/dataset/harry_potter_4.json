Certainly it is darker and slightly more mature in subject matter. However, there's a lingering \"freshman\" feel which I blame on the inclusion of the Tri Wizard Tournament. It seemed out of place at this point in the story. I have no problem with the idea that the wizarding establishment didn't believe (or want to believe) that Voldemort was back and ergo they would naturally carry on with their lives, as would the students, so the big sporting event is not precisely my issue. It's the amount of time spent on the event I'm taking to task. As readers, we know the ultimate evil has come again, so it's hard to suspend our dread and enjoy the fun and games of the tournament, or at least it was hard for me. Others I've spoke to don't seem to mind the \"fun and games\" aspect of this book. However, to me it seemed like Rowling hadn't given the storyline maturation its due. Was this a lack of skill on her part? Mishandling of story pacing is just as important as plot, realistic characters, appropriate dialogue and knowing how to put one word after another in the correct order. Perhaps the \"let them eat cake\" atmosphere of tragedy veiled is just what was called for. Time and again, history proves this scenario holds true for some. I wasn't buying it though.Rating: 3.5 - Goblet... gets perhaps a higher rating from me than you'd think after reading that complainypants review, but the fact is the book is still entertaining, and at this point I was so very wrapped up in the series that Rowling could've taken a dump, published it and I would've given it at least two stars.

They lose the will to live. You could always tell when a death was coming, because the Dementors could sense it, they got excited.U+201DThere certainly are some incredible quotes and passages throughout this novel, and I bow down to you, J.K.

While the first three books were comparatively short, this one was - so far - the longest with 766 pages. 766 pages? It felt like 300, considering my pace while rushing through this book.Please choose wisely before reading this review. There are no specific spoilers, but in case you haven't read the first four books in the series, you might want to turn away from this review.Until now, The Goblet of Fire was the Harry Potter book I enjoyed most because it managed to find the perfect point of balance between the dark, gloomy and complex plot elements surrounding the return of Vol ... sorry, You Know Who, and the light-hearted, funny scenes which managed to conjure a smile on my face whenever another one of those appeared during the course of the book. Still I couldn't bring myself to rate this with five stars, as there were quite a few things which bothered me. (And yes, I know that I am getting myself in severe danger right now with saying this. I will better take to my heels and run as fast as I can after posting this review.)First of all, in case you have not already realized this during The Prisoner of Azkaban, the Harry Potter series is far away from being a children's book series anymore. Especially in the beginning and the ending, horror elements outweigh everything else, crying at the reader, \"This is no children's book you are reading anymore!\" Well, then why does J.K. Rowling still constantly fall back to the habit of using childish language? A short search of the story brought up nearly 1,400 exclamation marks. And everytime I stumbled upon yet another one, the only thing I could think of was this picture ...But well, by now, I have developed a soft spot for Harry Potter books, and sometimes childish writing style is not that bad, just ... kind of annoying. However, quite a few other things bothered me while reading this book, and I will now try to go through them as fast as possible. After all, I have learned one thing about discussions in my school time which still stays with me - list the arguments your reader should forget about first, then he will be even more convinced by the positive arguments you will list afterwards.U+25BA Rita Skeeter. I am sure just dropping her name makes a lot of fans of the series want her to meet a Dementor. However, the way she appeared made me think of her as a pure caricature, causing nothing but trouble, without being even the slightest bit complex, simply annoying and not the least obstacle to write as a character because of her one-dimensional appearance. I would have loved to see some more insight into her character, but sadly ... J.K. Rowling decided to just present us with a caricature.U+25BA How could someone as dumb as Fudge be Minister for Magic? (That's no true criticism. After all, just look at some of our real world's politicians. And yet ... can someone please lock up Fudge right beside Rita?)U+25BA The next tournament should include a World Cup of Perfection. Dumbledore would almost certainly win.U+25BA Why isn't Hermione more prominent? Certain parts of the books made me wish for her character to have a more major role.Now that the reasons for my 4-star-rating are out of the way, here comes what I loved about the book:U+25BA DOBBY. I know there are quite a few people who didn't like his uncommon behavior, but I fell in love with him. He is probably the cutest and most adorable character of the entire series, and his actions are always based on good-hearted motivations. Go, Dobby!U+25BA Socks that scream when they stink? Definitely my favorite moment of the book.U+25BA DRAGONS!U+25BA There are new characters, there are old characters, but they all have a certain depth. (No, Rita, I am not speaking of you.) I especially loved how the dynamics between Ron, Hermione and Harry were explored by throwing some obstacles for their friendships into the game. And this article perfectly highlights why Hermione should have a more prominent role in the books.U+25BA The Triwizard Tournament was pure awesomeness. I loved every part of it, and I am not ashamed to admit it.U+25BA (Almost) nothing is predictable in this series. I was so sure to find out (view spoiler)[Bagman (hide spoiler)] is the true culprit, but ... J.K. Rowling took my prediction and shred it to pieces. (I only wish that my intention to predict things will not continue to be destroyed by spoilers people seem to carelessly leave all over the internet. I will leave a huge thank you right here to the person who spoiled all the upcoming deaths in the next three books to me ... in a review for the second Harry Potter book. Thank you.)U+25BA There are actually signs of romance! Now let's hope there will be some more developments on the romantic level of these books, because even though I hate when romantic entanglements are thrown into the story just to make sure the reader roots for the oh-so perfect protagonists, these books need some romance. Harry, Ron and Hermione are teenagers now, and I totally want to see them discovering that children aren't born just because two people care about each other.U+25BA I want more of Cho Chang. Seriously.U+25BA Hagrid might not be as cute as Dobby, but he is certainly just as adorable.U+25BA This has the best world-building ever. I never liked the fantasy genre; there was even a time which saw me absolutely and whole-heartedly loathing it.And then I read Harry Potter.Two final thoughts on this book:(view spoiler)[An athlete: What was the most important moment in the history of sports?Me: Viktor Krum caught the snitch, but Ireland won.

Well, this was a Star Destroyer sized plot hole. (view spoiler)[ Rowling goes to some length spelling out that portkeys can be anything. A cup. A book. A fluffy bunny. She also establishes that you can't teleport in and out of Hogwarts, because it's warded. Fair enough. BUT, Harry and his chums have often left the grounds of HG's, to go and drink 'butterbeer' or buy living chocolate frogs or snog in alleyways or whatever. The precedent has been set that they can and do leave the school grounds. FFS, Harry lived outside of Hogwarts for YEARS (and yeah Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru's [or whatever] place was magicked so folks couldn't find him, but how did he get back and forth to it, eh? A TRAIN.)SO, you are an evil overlord trying to take over the world. You need Harry's blood to get your body back. You have an agent WITHIN Hogwarts, despite all these magical defenses, disguised as a teacher that Harry implicitly trusts.Do you:a) Set in place an elaborate ruse, framed around this enormous tri-wizard tournament, which (presumably) is under scrutiny by the most powerful wizards in the world and the ministry of magic, in which you manipulate events so that Harry not only enters the tournament (despite rules that expressly say that he's not old enough) but wins it, touches the tri-wizard cup, which, despite all these defenses and wizard-y scrutiny and security, you've managed to turn into a frackin' portkey (yes, you're that good) so that he gets teleported away from the tourney grounds into your evil clutches and hey, you bleed that bitch.b) Have your agent (who Harry implicitly trusts) say \"hey Potter, what's say we head down to the pub for a mug of butterbeer and I'll tell you some stuff about your dad/mum/long lost twin?\" use all your evil-wizardyness to change a mug of butterbeer into a portkey, and save everyone around 400 pages of this book.Sorry, but I didn't buy it. I've read many fan arguments explaining why the tri-wizard tournament and everything around it wasn't window-dressing on an overly complicated plan, the fruits of which could have very easily been borne by a far less convoluted and complex Evil Scheme(tm) which, granted, probably wouldn't have made a very interesting book, but YOUR WAREZ, I AM NOT BUYING THEM. (hide spoiler)]But second, and more importantly, it was in GoF that I realized that Harry was going to win. That he was just awesome, and no matter what rules were set in place (you're too young to enter the tournament/you're ten years old, why on earth would we put you in the CLUTCH position on our Quidditch team/you wear glasses, the ladiez don't dig dudes in glasses) he would triumph. Rowling LOVED Harry. She loved all the Harry gang. Too much. And it became painfully obvious that these kids were going to win, without a single fatality/crippling sacrifice/crushing loss. That in the end, Voldemort would be beaten, and Harry would marry Ginny, and Ron would marry Hermione and everyone would live happily ever after and make lots of adorable wizard babies.This was the book Harry ceased being a character and became a caricature. A SUPERHERO. Superheros bore me. I want torment. I want LOSS. I want my heroes to pay a TANGIBLE and TERRIBLE price for their victories. And no, killing tertiary characters doesn't count. (view spoiler)[Digory? The Weasley twin? Even Dumbledore (yeah I know he dies, I got spoiled) is disposable.  (hide spoiler)]I need to believe my heroes could fail. I know they probably won't. I know the good guys will eventually win. But I need to be afraid for them. I need to be scanning the faces of the MAIN characters and wondering \"which one of you will be dead/emotionally crippled/hideously disfigured before the final act is over?\" And I never believed for a second that Rowling would harm a hair on their heady-head-heads.(view spoiler)[And, turns out, she didn't. :P (hide spoiler)](shrugs)[ Rowling goes to some length spelling out that portkeys can be anything.

I know that's how they'll be in the rest of the series, yet it doesn't make my surprise smaller.You're probably tired of me saying this, but I must again say how changed the characters are from how they were three books ago. Still in their early teen years, but more mature.I read this book for the first time more than four years ago, and of tge seven books, this is the one I remembered the most vividly before rereading. That led me to the conclusion I wrote at the beginning of this review: This is the best book in the series.Actually, I am mistaken. This is not the best book in the series. They grow better the more you read - the complexity and darkness is greater with each book - but for some reason, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire stuck in my memory better than the others had and became my favourite of the series. Perhaps it was the Tournament and the tasks, or I don't know, but it's clear one thing: This is the book I love the most in the series.Now, no more ramblings from me.

While Rowling certainly doesn't mention a magic school anywhere near me, she opens up for the possibility. She expands her universe of wonder; she pushes the boundaries, and somehow everything seem closer. More relatable. Magic stops being a distinctly British thing and becomes an international phenomen. Something that could perhaps happen to a girl in Denmark as well. At least that's what I thought then. Rowling's novels are good, but they can at times feel very constricted. There are very few actual environments described; you have the village of Hogsmeade with all its colors and wonders (matching up to Diagon Alley), you have the muggle life with the Dursley family U+2013 always dreary, boring and painful, and you have Hogwarts of course, buzzing with energy, magic sparks and new adventures. At times you have a glimpse of London mixed with a visit at the Weasley's, an occasional tale from the dark prison of Azkaban, but that's really it.Until this book. Not only does it introduce new schools and new environments U+2013 it also takes us to graveyards of horror and Rowling finally mixes her two spheres (the muggle world and the wizarding worlds) in a glorious game of Quidditch. You get to see the union of these two, very different, worlds, and you finally understand how they aren't as separate as one would think; how they depend on each other, gravitate towards each other, and hide each other. Constantly.It's beautiful. And well worth the wait."},

Tell him yourself. It's the only way to sort this out.\" Unlike many teens today, Hermione doesn't resort to Twitter or Facebook or Tumblr to resolve her conflicts - she actually uses conversation and compromise! Before anyone mentions the fact that they didn't have Facebook way back when, remember that they could've used owls... or something...2) She starts the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare. Not only does she create the club, she believes in her cause even when every other person shuts her down. While I admire her activism, I also love how Rowling incorporated subtler messages about racism. Ron being racist to an extent exemplifies how you don't have to be the KKK to discriminate, and Rowling did a great job portraying positive role models like Lupin and Hagrid as minority groups.3) On page 214 when Hermione tells Moody to stop the Cruciatus Curse, she does so because she senses Neville's discomfort - thus showing that she is sensitive to other people's needs. What a winner.4) Throughout the book when Harry is castigated by his peers Hermione is the only one who sticks by his side. She has no regard for what other people think of her and abides by her own beliefs. I'm glad J.K. Rowling incorporated such a positive role model not only for young girls, but for anyone who reads the series.5) When Ron admits that he would go to the Yule Ball with a girl who were stupid as long as she was pretty, Hermione snaps at him and walks away. She does not give into society's conventions in terms of valuing physical attractiveness as opposed to intelligence. Then, when Ron notes that Hermione is \"a girl\", she does not devalue herself by appreciating his late realization - she storms off, once again propelled by what she thinks is right.6) At the end of the book when Hermione captures Rita Skeeter she exhibits mercy by promising to eventually set her loose - other characters may have just killed her or allowed her to suffer a much worse fate. Once again, Hermione acts as a great combination of emotion and logic: these days it may seem like young protagonists, especially of the female variety, may only have one of these traits... but, Hermione disproves that.Alas, perhaps I am a hardcore fan of Hermione just because I see so much of myself in her. Overall, I enjoyed reading the fourth installment - Rowling knows how to write a tightly-spun yet scintillating plot. While she overuses adverbs sometimes and has a tendency to reveal everything at the end of the book through heaps of dialogue (this was the case in the previous books too), I stayed up until 2 AM just to speed through the last 150 pages of this book. Looking forward to reading the last three, and apparently much darker, books in this series."},

Shows what they know.I don't know if anyone on goodreads followed the intense Harry Potter fanbase core in the good old days. I wasn't on goodreads until after the last book came out. Goblet of Fire was the last Harry Potter book before all of the bitching naysayers. It was never as much fun after that, either to discuss theories or pick apart clues. It was also the book that started the \"I hate Ron!\" club (the Draco Malfoy is a conflicted hero idea started around the Chamber of Secrets film. Hey, I could be a Harry Potter scholar). It was pretty much like looking up any movie on the imdb or a tv show on Television Without Pity. No one hates something more than an obsessive fan, right? Fanfic writers who actually preferred their interpretations more than the original source (crazy!). The fanbase could be deterimental to nuturing ones own \"ohmigod I'm going to die without the next book\" that I so desperately needed. Harry Potter was my \"something to look forward to\". I haven't found anything else to take its place. I've not tried to hang around the fringes of a big fan base again, either. (My random goodreads tastes probably don't count. I have no idea what the big thing is. I liked The Hunger Games for the cozy district twelve parts and didn't give a rationed fig for love triangles or political outcome. I'm a loner bookworm freak!) Almost as bad were all of the people who felt some pressing need to inform me that they were too cool to even try to read Harry Potter, as if it made one bit of difference to me. [I suspect that I was expected to backtrack. You know, the way a person will immediately downplay how much they liked or disliked something based on what someone else says about it.] I was going to read it with or without them. They were not beating me by being too cool for school (especially if that school is Hogwarts!). Why were they too cool for Harry after Goblet of Fire? The fans, I mean.I don't remember an awful lot about plot points (I'm older now and my memory wasn't that good to begin with). There is some overlap between books, for sure. I do remember savoring the details and not because it would help me figure out was going to happen. I WANTED surprises. Harry disliking Ron for the bit of skin showing between his ankles and his pajama ends? That would totally have swayed me to be unwilling to hear an apology and nurse the annoyance another few days. I loved it when the whole school hated Harry (which is about all of the time). I loved how he didn't study and had to work up to the last minute nerve for everything. Those kinds of details made it for me. I remember the wait between the books and being excited to find out what Neville was up to over the summer (long live Neville Longbottom!). But no, the base was miffed 'cause they didn't get another Sirius Black who owned the motorbike that Hagrid used to escort Harry to Privet Drive appearing in Prisoner of Azkaban. If that's what you wanted the appeal of Harry Potter would be dead in the water with the giant squid after the last book. That's not me!Oh yeah, so it was a huge turning point in the series. Voldemort rises again, the romance shit (Rowling's one big flaw, in my mind). They got longer and less tightly edited (we fans were greedy for closer release dates. They had no one but themselves to blame!). Maybe some details got piled on (I can't remember which book had the useless James Potter quidditch info. Half-blood?). I think it was the Ron thing, anyway. D'oh. It has to be that. Maybe it was like season three of Buffy when Buffy goes to L.A. in the first episode and they still cut back to Sunnydale to show how the Scooby gang are faring without her. The new factors of the war is out there situation was like cutting into the Scooby dynamic. It's painful to go your own way and be all alone. It was like reaching the end half way through. Harry has to grow up, he has to defeat Lord Voldything and leave Hogwarts. And that's a sad feeling 'cause it means that I also have to leave Hogwarts. The bitching had to be about change. It still worked, it just worked in a different way. Change isn't popular.There are faults in the series but I loved what I loved so much that I didn't care. I just want to be in Hogwarts. I could tease about what I didn't like and still loved what I loved. How to be a Harry Potter fan in the style of Mariel 101. I'm sure I'll be rewarded with my Hogwarts letter any day now.D'oh! Of course! S.P.E.W. I remember now. (Society for Promotion of Elvish Welfare for the non-nerds. Oh wait, those people will not be reading this.) All the dumbfucks argued that the house elves wanted to be enslaved and that the point of the series was that Hermione was representing America rushing in to save oppressed civilizations when they shouldn't have been involved. (Dudes, they were probably the ones they needed saving from.) Uggggggh. So children should have always slaved away in factories because that was their only wages? Because they saw the film Newsies and Christian Bale looked like he was having a lot of fun? Killing Mudbloods is bad (\"Sure, I don't want to kill kids but wars in the middle east are still a great idea!\") but reading about equality for all is less interesting if it changes the bottom line? I probably started resenting the fanbase a whole lot right around that time. Rowling could have made the point less hammer-head like (via Hermione). The films succeeded in that quite well. But still! It is like being in the wizarding world itself to have read that kind of crap. Bigots everywhere. Poor Dobby! Sobs. (Winky was fucking annoying, though.)I also didn't mention the \"Harry is a Death Eater\" people. I wonder where they are right now. Probably in a dark corner of the internet somewhere, writing about the \"truth\" of the Harry Potter series. Grrrrrrrrrrrr. Harry is all that is good and pure in this world!P.s. I always skipped Quidditch scenes. The Triwizard scenes were kinda Quidditch-y to me. For that reason Goblet is my least favorite of the series. And I hated reading about Ron not liking Harry. But still! I remember when I got Goblet of Fire. I had to go to work and stop reading it. I didn't think about anything else but what was going to happen next in this book. Every other day was I numb with wanting to be anywhere else. That day I was happy to be in my own head. Goblet of Fire is a great book by my own definition because of that."},

I absolutely adore his narration. If you haven't listening to the audio books I would highly recommend the investment! This book was great and I loved every page of it (can I say that even though I'm listening?), obviously it's Harry Potter, though The Prisoner of Azkaban still remains my favorite. I absolutely loved the time Harry spent with the Weasley family and getting to know their dynamics better. They are hilarious and witty and fun and can J.K. Rowling write a book just about them, please?! With every book J.K Rowling opens our eyes a little more to the wonderful world she has created between the pages of her books. In this book we get to see more about the wizarding world outside of Hogwarts and England, what daily life looks like as a wizard, and we definitely get to learn more about it's past. The only non positive, I don't want to say negative because once again it's Harry Potter and there are no negatives, thing I would say about this book are the tasks in the Triwizard Tournament. They were rather lackluster and definitely more exciting and entertaining in the movie.

As the warm, easy, potato chip prose crossed my blood-brain barrier, euphoria ensued. My inner child was smitten. I...was...hooked and I...was...happy. Ignore the so-called \"experts\" who say POTter is brain cell killing pap. DonU+2019t listen to those jaded, book snobby squares. Most of them are wound so tight they wouldnU+2019t know a good book if it sat on their face and wriggled. POTter makes you feel good. POTter makes you smile. POTter makes you joyous and giggly. Hell, POTter makes you want to use the word giggly. POTter is enjoyable and fun. That's enough for me. So what made  the Goblet so much more addicting than the rest of the POTter I had tried. Part of it was that I had already seen the movies (up through Order of the Phoenix) before I got my hands on genuine POTter. The first 3 were fun but I felt like I had already \"been there done that\" as they were pretty faithfully adaptated for the screen. Still enjoyable, but not enough to put the POTter monkey on my back. Then came the Goblet of POTter and it was a big, huge, tightly-rolled fatty at 750 pages. The cut, diluted movie strain couldnU+2019t hope to be as potent as the primo original and the story was finally given the room to breathe and take on an epic feel. It was completely addictive. The world-building details started coming fast and furious and the characters were given considerably increased depth. Add that to RowlingU+2019s breezy, U+201Cear friendlyU+201D prose and I found myself spaced out for hours turning the pages and still hungering for more. ItU+2019s high praise indeed when I say that 750 pages did not contain a single dull, ploddy moment. This was fun and wonderful and a pleasure to experience. It deserves to be recognized for the iconic work that it is in the realm of YA fantasy. Is it popcorn? Certainly. Is it a joy to read? Definitely. Is it one I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to all lovers of feel good, comfort food? YES. 5.0 stars.

I love that Bill stood up for himself and was like NOBODY GIVE AN F HOW I LOOK, AND NEITHER DO IIIIII. It was a nice thing to throw in there.-Dobby is also in this book more, and seeing how different he is was really fun.-Harry and Ron fighting made my heart hurt so much.-All of the drama at the Yule Ball just made me SQUEEE because it's so obvious that Ron and Hermione like each other and they just don't want to admit it and GAH. THE FEELS.-I also love how much Hermione stands up for what she believes in, which you can particularly see in this book. She wants justice for the house-elves, she won't let Ron get away with being an idiot (like when he says he just wants a pretty girl to go to the ball with), and she is especially confident in this book as well. Malfoy and many other people are constantly teasing her, but she is completely above it, and for that I admire her.-WHEN HARRY IS LISTENING TO HAGRID AND MADAME MAXIME AND HE SEES THE BEETLE?

He was such an amazing person, and I wish that he could have survived so him and Harry could have been buddies.-VOLDEMORT FORESHADOWS HORCRUXES IN THIS BOOK.

Then they get a little tricky b/c while 4 and 5 look to be about the same length, the font in Order of the Phoenix is much smaller, hence a longer book. I just started that one and it honestly feels longer already. More of a book book and less of a fun afternoon's diversion. But I like these books as they get both darker and longer.But to focus on Goblet of Fire specifically for a moment...again, not that I think I can bring anything new to the table in discussing these books. Nevertheless, I'll throw a few ideas out there just for your reading pleasure. One thing that struck me, as I mentioned before, was the increasing maturity and complexity of situations and themes. Clearly having someone die is a huge deal and I found that whole series of events really moving this time around. I may have last time as well, but I don't remember. In a way, though, some of the more complex issues feel jarring next to the goofy concepts she originally created. Calling non-magical people \"Muggles,\" for instance. It's just a stupid word and yes, it sounds funny and makes kids laugh, but sometimes it's hard to take all these people seriously. \"Mud-bloods\" on the other hand is vicious and definitely drives the point home. I just wonder if she was to do it over again if some of those terms or ideas would change a bit. Yes, we'd all like to revisit what we did/wrote when we were less sure of ourselves and our voices and ideas, but of course we can't and neither can she. And what do I know? She claims she always knew what would happen to Harry, so maybe for her \"Muggle\" is the ideal word.Since, as usual, I find it impossible to discuss the books without referencing the films, let me just say that although I hated Dobby in the movie (2?) and was glad to see him mostly cut from subsequent screen incarnations, I really loved him in this one. The dialogue is actually quite funny and Hermione's whole S.P.E.W. thing just cracks me up. Yes, I know a lot of people hate it and find it annoying and whatever, but I love it. Of course she would have a cause like that. That's who she is! And poor Winky. They're weird creatures (and OH how I love Kreacher in the next one!) and I can't decide whether I am with Hermione or everyone else on their \"plight.\" Either way, I like that they exist; they provide a bit of moral ambiguity in a world that is mostly cleanly divided between good and evil. You might wonder about people, but for the most part they end up squarely one or the other. Other than Snape - another great piece of moral ambiguity whose complexity grows from book to book.I also continue to marvel at Rowling's ability to write about the teenage mind. Ron and Harry's fight is spot on, as are Hermione's various reactions to it. And oh these poor boys having to ask the girls to the feast. I wish I had known when I was in middle school how truly hard it was for boys to talk to girls like that. Although I probably wouldn't have cared, being the good self-involved teenger that I was. I still want to go to Hogwarts."},

Greetings, loved ones, and let us talk of a young witch named Hermione Granger.Hermione is, and always has been, a delight to read. Not necessarily because she's a girl, but because she is the only character amongst those 14 year olds who actually has a good head on her shoulders. When I was young and gullible, I hated this book. Hated how it killed off Cedric and how bloody the series got afterwards. I hated it enough to renounce the franchize. Now that I re-read it, I still hate it, but for all different reasons. Cedric, on second reading, is as dull as toast (so I guess the movie casting must have been really spot-on). Harry has finally started to shed his unnatural maturity, and has turned just as obnoxious as most boys at 13. Ron is a wanker. So it's beyond me why Hermione hasn't stolen the spotlight here, as she is easily the most relatable character of them all.Let's look at her character - she is from a muggle family, but through hard work she has become the best student in the school. She studies hard, follows the rules, but makes exceptions when the circumstances are right. She comes off as stuck-up at first, but looks after her friends. She keeps her promises, even though she barely has time to take care of herself. And yet Ron is Harry's best friend, not her.Why?Harry and Ron are much closer than Harry and Hermione. In the previous book, Hermione was at odds with the boys not one, but twice, and that put a serious hinge on their friendship. Even so, that doesn't nearly come close to the drama that follows Harry and Ron's falling out in this book. And then, when they do make up, Hermione is once again pushed back as a tercery best friend, even though she sacrificed her efforts and sleep in order to help Harry learn a spell that would save his skinny ass.Hermione is defined by her intelligence. It falls squarely on her shoulders to help the guys when they're in a pickle - whenever they discover that rushing at an obstackle headfirst isn't going to cut it, they turn to her for advice, and she's also acutely aware of issues of inequality. In this book, she actually starts an organisation to help house elves! She stands up for Hagrid when Rita Skeeter takes a sling at him, and she kept Lupin's secret for months in book three simply because she believed he was a good guy! And where do her efforts to promote equality lead to? They're used for comedic relief.It's equally disgusting how little the boys seem to appreciate her. Not only do they refuse to take her seriously, they consider she's for granted. I mean, sure, Harry has lived with his relatives as an upper middle class brat (a much abused middle class brat), but Hermione's parents are dentists and yet she has a better awareness of social issues than he does! Is Rowling trying to suggest that young activism is only for women, because only women seem aware of these issues?But that's not even the worst this book gets. On the Yule Ball, Harry and Ron take ages before they realize Hermione is a girl, and thus, qualified to be a dance partner (obiously, they can't go with each other, altough it would be most logical, what with all the sparks flying among them). Hermione, though, refuses to be taken for granted. She knows she deserves better than to be a go-to girl, and she does - she gets to be Viktor Krum's date, and she damn well got someone who appreciates her! But are her friends happy for her? No, they're shocked, and in Ron's case, offended, that she dared *gasp* make plans without them! Ron goes as far as to make a scene - in which he (not for the first time) makes Hermione cry. This was supposed to establish some beginnings of the love between Hermione and Ron, but, quite frankly, it just makes Ron look like a wanker. After Rita Skeeter's article, Hermione becomes the target for bullying which, in some cases, turns rather dangerous. Grown-up witches send her hate mail packed with all sorts of deadly stuff, one of which makes the skin of her hands fall off. Ron's commentary? She should have seen it coming, messing around with the paparazzi like that. I bet the bumrag was happy she got punished for liking Krum. But that's not even what's most disturbing about this thing - it's that witches who have never even met Hermione before are willing to take Skeeter's word for it, even if the woman's as trustworthy as a snake. Even Mrs. Weasley, whose own husband got blackened twice in \"The Daily Prophet\", believes her! Nice message for female solidarity, Ms Rowling, real subtle.Again, I ask, why can't Hermione be the hero of these series? I don't think I'm alone in thinking it could be so much better. "},

His enemies still want to kill him (what else is new?) and this time they use a very elaborate scheme to do just that. Poor Boy Who Lived have to fight ever more difficult challenges on the top of his ever more difficult classes.In case somebody still did not get a clue that the series left children book territory in the end of the previous book, this one begins with a chapter seemingly taken straight from an adult horror story instead of showing Harry's misery with his life with his adoptive parents as was always the case before. The said misery starts in the second chapter. This novel is also practically as big as the first three put together.The structure of the book looks strange if you stop the (exciting) read and think about it. The beginning and the end of it are quite gloomy and contain some horror elements while the middle part is actually quite humorous and lighthearted at times. Surprisingly it actually works. We finally got to see other schools of wizardry, their headmasters and some of their pupils. Some new fascinating (both in good and bad sense) and important people are introduced. Some interesting people/creatures are back (go Dobby!!!). Good people die. No resolution is in sight by the end and the situation became much worth than it was in the beginning. Somebody mentioned that in this book the reader gets to live in Hogwarts; I missed this the first time around rushing through all the excitement of the events, but I noticed this during the reread. The freaking School of Wizardry feels alive and real! This is not a small feat of the author. This is also the reason I gave the higher rating this time.

This book! lot of things happened and I'm still in shocked. okay let's begin with Cedric Diggory.   My Most Saddest SceneCedric was a nice guy and he was really sweet and I liked him. I was so shocked when he died because I thought he would be alive until the last book and he died so fast that I just sat on my bed and I was like \" What did just happen? \" I still can't believe he died in such a young age and it was all because of Voldemort. Oh! and I was so proud of Harry too! he's so kind that he suggested Cedric to hold the cup with him, So there would be two winners not only Harry or Cedric and I was so confused who I wanted to get the cup first, I liked Cedric but I also liked Harry. So I was very happy when Harry suggested that but that happiness vanished as fast as it came. The cup was a portkey and the cup transported them to Voldemort and Cedric died so fast that I didn't even cry. I was just so shocked.because what would Harry say to his parents?! and I was so worried what about if they blamed Harry for this ?!? but thankfully that didn't happen. Cedric's parents were very sad but they didn't blame Harry. They even thanked him for returning Cedric's body to them.   My Favotite ScenesI think there is something change between Hermione and Ron.Ron was so mad when Hermione went to the ball with Viktor. He said it was because Viktor was from Drumstrang and he said Hermione was fraternizing with the enemy. But I still don't believe this at all. Before Hermione went to the ball with Viktor, Ron liked Viktor so much that he even wanted to get his autograph and I think he acted like that because he was jealous. hahaha. it was so funny and sweet to see Ron got jealous and there's also this scene : 'Known what?' said Ron quickly. 'You haven't been mixing up Love Potions, have you?''Don't be stupid,' Hermione snapped, starting to pound up her beetles again. ' No, it's just ... how did she know Viktor asked me to visit him over the summer?'Hermione blushed scarlet as she said this and determinedly avoided Ron's eyes. 'What?' said Ron, dropping his pestle with a loud clunk.'He asked me right after he'd pulled me out of the lake,' Hermione muttered. 'After he'd got rid of his shark's head. Madam Pomfrey gave us both blankets and then he sort of pulled me away from the judges so they wouldn't hear, and he said, if I wasn't doing anything over the summer, would I like to -''And what did you say?' said Ron, who had picked up his pestle and was grinding it on the desk, a good six inches from his bowl, because he was looking at Hermione. 'and he did say he'd never felt the same way about anyone else,'Hermione went on, going so red now that Harry could almost feel the heat coming from her, 'but how could Rita Skeeter have heard him? She wasn't there ... or was she? Maybe she has got an invisibility Cloak, maybe she sneaked into the grounds to watch the second task ...' 'And what did you say?' Ron repeated, pounding his pestle down so hard it dented the desk. 'Well, I was too busy seeing whether you and Harry were OK to -'but before she could finish that sentence Snape came. Ugh. why did he have to come when she hadn't finish it!?!? but that scene was sweet and funny wasn't it?! AHH MY HEART!!  The Plot Twist The plot twist in this book was better than the plot twist in first book, second book and third book. I swear I didn't expect that at all! I thought the bad guy was Ludo Bagman because he acted so strange. He asked Harry whether he wanted his help or not and so I thought he was the bad guy. then there was a scene where Moody was the bad guy but he wasn't Moody. he was the imposter of Moody and the real Moody was imprisoned in his own trunk and this imposter was Barty Crouch's son.

U+23E9This is the year when the rivalry between houses has a slightly subdued presence as the Beauxbatons and the Durmstrang crowd arrives. In the face of stiff international competition, the rare display of camaraderie between Hufflepuff and Gryffindor is an indicator that Dumbledore's party is capable of standing united to tackle the external adversary, whether it is only the harmless fellow wizarding schools or a more nefarious death eater or the ultimate Dark Lord himself. U+23E9No other untoward incident in any of the previous Harry Potter books hurt as much as the horrific death of the charming, beloved Cedric Diggory.

[image error]Rowling has always exercised caution in doling out punishments unnecessarily to the undeserving people, but, maybe she wanted the Triwizard Cup to be a turning point. The moment Cedric and Harry touched the cup was also the moment that brought contradictory, unhappy feelings to our hitherto always-feel-good Harry Potter moments.

Add in the changing dynamics between girls and boys at Hogwarts, and suddenly Rowling's fourth book has a weight and seriousness not as present in early books in the series.

Cedric Diggory)* We get a glimpse of the friendship and absolute loyalty that is shown to Harry by Ron and Hermione (after Ron throws his little hissy fit of course and comes to his senses)Amazon ReviewIn Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, J.K. Rowling offers up equal parts danger and delight--and any number of dragons, house-elves, and death-defying challenges. Now 14, her orphan hero has only two more weeks with his Muggle relatives before returning to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Yet one night a vision harrowing enough to make his lightning-bolt-shaped scar burn has Harry on edge and contacting his godfather-in-hiding, Sirius Black. Happily, the prospect of attending the season's premier sporting event, the Quidditch World Cup, is enough to make Harry momentarily forget that Lord Voldemort and his sinister familiars--the Death Eaters--are out for murder.Readers, we will cast a giant invisibility cloak over any more plot and reveal only that You-Know-Who is very much after Harry and that this year there will be no Quidditch matches between Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Instead, Hogwarts will vie with two other magicians' schools, the stylish Beauxbatons and the icy Durmstrang, in a Triwizard Tournament. Those chosen to compete will undergo three supreme tests. Could Harry be one of the lucky contenders? Long before her fourth installment appeared, Rowling warned that it would be darker, and it's true that every exhilaration is equaled by a moment that has us fearing for Harry's life, the book's emotions running as deep as its dangers. Along the way, though, she conjures up such new characters as Alastor \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, a Dark Wizard catcher who may or may not be getting paranoid in his old age, and Rita Skeeter, who beetles around Hogwarts in search of stories. (This Daily Prophet scoop artist has a Quick-Quotes Quill that turns even the most innocent assertion into tabloid innuendo.) And at her bedazzling close, Rowling leaves several plot strands open, awaiting book 5.

This one started out much darker, focusing on He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named and his initial attempts to regain his physical form.Second, while this is still a kids' book, the are some very strong, very dark undertones throughout the entire book. The storyline moved from the \"Scooby-Doo\" format to something along the lines of dark fantasy, which happened at about the 80% point of this book. I wouldn't go so far as to compare it to George R. R. Martin or Joe Abercrombie, but the underlying threat and potential violence is definitely there. The twists in this one are surprising, especially in finding out who falls on which side, both good and evil.Third, this is the first book of the series to end without concluding the main storyline. The first three were like a 70s sitcom, resolving some problem within the half-hour time frame of that week's episode. In this one, very little is resolved.

She's got a Quidditch World Cup happening; she's got the crazy Triwizard Tournament, and all its machinations; she's got Harry's hormones starting to rage; she's got a jumble of adult politics and the old and new wars against Voldemort competing with Harry for time; she's got the endless Rita Skeeter vs. Hermione subplot; then she's got the Hermione - Dobby - Winky - SPEW debate; she's got the first appearance of the Pensieve, and its onslaught of explication; she's got not-Mad Eye Moody to introduce, the first serious appearance of Voldemort, another ghostly visitation, Padfoot hanging around in caves, Fred & George scheming their brains out, and Dumbledore being his usual forthcoming self; she's got Tournament challenges and school to deliver; she's got humiliating dances for us to attend; she's got the death of Cedric Diggory; and she's got all her usual suspects -- Snape, McGonagall, Neville, Hagrid, the Malfoys, etc., etc.. It's a lot of ground to cover. I think it is too much, and I am sure that if she hadn't been an institution, she'd have been forced to cut and trim.But I am damn glad she wasn't forced to cut and trim. Sure Goblet of Fire could have been tighter. Sure it could have been a slicker story, more compelling, faster in the telling. But fuck all that. Life is messy. Shit is always going on around you. Just look around tomorrow and you'll see it happening. And all of those diversions, all of that messiness, is a reflection of the way life is. More importantly, though, I just love the fact that an author -- ANY AUTHOR -- reached that stage with her writing, reached the point where it was so beloved she could tell the story her way without any interference. Most authors only get to do that if they stay in the ghettoes of self-publishing, but Rowling moved into the gated suburbs and painted her house all the colours of the rainbow, and she was so fucking rich and powerful that the community council just let her do her thing. That is authorial victory, and that makes Goblet of Fire a personal fave.Besides, it's kinda fun despite its flaws. And it is the first time I really fell for Hermione. She's one of the great supporting characters in all of literature. Seriously. She's up there with Dr. Watson (but better)."},

There's still so much more detail in the books that obviously can't be put into the films due to timing, so i still get to enjoy the books tremendously. It's still great getting a more detailed view of the magical world and its many characters. I think the Triwizard Tournament chapters were my favorite, they were fun to read and interesting to see how the contestants would react to certain circumstances. To be exact, my favorite one was the second task which took place in the Black Lake. The Yule Ball was also interesting and a bit chaotic.. Hagrid, Maxime, Hermione, and Ron entertained me so much during the Yule Ball chapter. I also enjoyed getting to know the backstory of Hagrid's past! You feel sympathy towards him as you are reading about him. I learned so much about his origin and how he is perceived by other people. The house elves contributed a decent amount to the novel, i enjoyed reading about them and Winky was funny to me but also frustrated me a bit. House elves are strange little creatures... I also found the reporter Rita Skeeter to be quite annoying and irritating, i am pretty sure that was one of Rowling's objectives when she was developing the character, so she excelled at that. There's just so much i enjoyed in this novel. I won't go into more detail since i don't want this review to end up being eternal and to have spoilers.

The big reveal at the end makes so much sense, but being able to read it knowing what was happening really made me see the smaller details of it all and I think it's one of the cleverer ones plot wise. I feel like it perfectly hits that mix of dark plots and events with humour and fun that characterises Harry Potter. The scenes at the end with Cedric dying, Harry having to explain what happened are so, so incredibly sad. Much sadder than I appreciated the first time I read them. But Harry has come to mean so much to me and seeing him sad makes me really, really sad. He's such a good lad who's seen too much. Pretty much the whole maze/graveyard scene, the scenes with Crouch and the scenes of terror at the Quidditch World Cup are genuinely frightening and really well written. Also think the whole pensieve scene is well done, and any scene with Dumbledore and Harry interacting. But on the other side, the side plot of Fred and George trying to get their gold from Ludo, the plots about Rita Skeeter and the news articles, The Yule Ball and the teen relationship angst are so funny and lighthearted and I feel that contrast is what really makes Harry Potter. This book takes on that tone that the later ones follow and I really, really like that. There's just so much to like here from the epc opening Quidditch game, to the expansive plot, to the loveable and awful characters and the humour and the sadness and the heartbreak.

I love how the clues, if you're able to add them all up to the right answer, are all cleverly imparted within the text. Never does it feel like extraneous information, but it also doesn't feel important - Of course, we come to find out later just how important those pieces of information were.If you're one that's only been watching the movies (and don't get me wrong, I love the movies), you're missing out - a lot - here in this story. The book is so incredibly big that they had to cut some of the storylines, had to shorten and paraphrase others, and I think, overall, it really does suffer for it. Yes, yes, I know - SPEW isn't necessary and doesn't really matter, but *shrugs* I love it. I love that storyline, I love what it implies, and I love what it shows of a certain character. That's by no means the only cut that this book suffered when it was translated to the big-screen, though.There are other things that are softened, or made less horrible in the movies - I remember the first time I read the books after having seen the movies. I love Snape. I always have and always will, but it's easier to love Rickman's portrayal of him in the movies. He's an ass in the books - abusive, at best, to his students. (And let me clarify here, I don't love what he does, always, but he's an excellent character.) In the movies, though, he's still a jerk, but the 'best intentions' are written all over him. And that's kind of unfortunate, too. Another loss is Ron's shitty behaviour. Honestly, I'd nearly forgotten about his behaviour in this one, but his character really stands out to me as ... not good. He constantly believes the stereotypes and rumors and things other people have told him about other magical beings and people. He is very hard pressed to form his own opinions. He believes the absolute worse of his BEST FRIEND and treats him like shit. He mocks and berates his other BEST FRIEND. Ugh. I don't like you, Ron. And every time I read the books that dislike gets a little more intense.Anywho - let me get off that rant. I love this book. I love the suspense, the tension, the mystery. I love the tasks - even if there are only three of them. I loved learning more about other wizards and their cultures. This book really builds towards the climax - and I remember exactly how shocked I was when I reached it the first time. I felt sure that it couldn't happen, it shouldn't so it wouldn't.This book definitely brings out the emotions in me. I still tear up near the end, and cheer when Harry faces his first task.

It was like, one of the most awaited and amazing part of the book. And so many things were really confusing and could be only understood by reading the book.The things I didn't about this book:1) J.K Rowing, full respect and admiration from me to you, you are an awesome writer, but I just felt weird throughout the whole book. I really, really wanted this book to have other people's point of view, not that I don't like Harry, but I really wanted to know what was happening with Hermione, especially with Krum, since I am girl with great expectation from Hermione when Yule Ball happened. And I was so disappointed and annoyed because I really wanted to know what Krum said to Hermoine in the end of the book.2) A great point made by a reviewer. (Christopher Ferry)Why did fake-Moody/Crouch Jr. set up this immensely complicated and low probability plan to get Harry to win the Triwizard Cup and be teleported to Voldemort when he was his trusted teacher the whole school year. He could have just made a pen be a portkey and then dropped it and said \"Harry, could you pick that up for me?\" Much easier than dealing with dragons, suborning house-elves, and casting outlawed curses. 3) The book was unnecessarily long. Seriously, I can just cut 100-150 pages from this book by removing all the scenes of Rita Skeeter's shit and house-elf's crying and Hermione's debating. J.K Rowling should have just focused on The Triwizard Tournament (which was by the way, awesome!) and on the last chapters. And Cedric's death, GOD! Either I am an obsessed fan of Cedric and was expecting more or that J.K Rowling is not that good in writing someone's death. I was even surprised at Crouch's death.\"I killed my father and then buried him\" said Crouch's son.\"... o.o ... o.O ... -_-I mean come-on! He was in this book for a pretty long time and just telling this and then going on to the next chapter was just weird. Besides all the things I mentioned above, I found this book really good, exciting and now I want to find out what happens in the end even more eagerly! The last 100 pages were indeed awesome and I will rate this book 3.5/5 stars. And yeah, how can I ever forget. :) *evil grin*THE HOTTIES!KRUM! CEDRIC! I love you both.

But, god i was wrong. Goblet of Fire swept Prisoner of Azkaban from my favorite spot and settled there gracefully, it didn't have the dark tone of Prisoner of Azkaban, but it had a cheerful, festive feeling, which really fits the book, the world continued being built in an exquisite way, tons of new characters gets introduced and noneof them is boring or typical, and my favorite part about this book is it's mystery element, imagine all the questions that you had in Prisoner of Azkaban and double it, that's how perplexed the situation were, and of course Rowling just dazzled all of us by foreshadowing the answers to each question several times during the book, and branch out with some genuinely exceptional sub-plots, and connect them all together at the end in a frustratingly skillful way to unravel the mystery of the book. and of course the writing style is so whimsical, it's simple but still so rich, it adds a lot to the story, the world and the character, the character development, and the growing up difficulties are depicted in this book in a very natural and distinctive manner, it's so brilliant to see how our three main character growing up and get jealous of each other and fight with each other and avoid each other. all these elements comes together to add so much depth and layers to Goblet of Fire, which made it for me a complete masterpiece in every single way, and to claim once again that Goblet of Fire is my favorite of the series (So Far)."},

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire starts as the others did, where Harry has to leave the dastardly Dursley's and come to Hogwarts. Once there the book picks up again, but the small, darker themes seen before have become magnified. While Quidditch was the game in the previous books, this time they have a special and bizarre wizarding tournament that has some seriously scary stuff. You have to wonder what goes on in the mind of school administrators in the wizarding world.The tests and trials are divided up into months and scenes since they can relax in between (thank God.) The trials themselves are interesting, especially the last as it shows the twist of betrayal and the resurrection of a certain big-bad of the series. Besides in between the trials, Harry has to contend with his friend Ron's growing jealousy and frictions that added an in interesting and realistic touch. It's small and evens out quickly, but it highlights Ron again as one of the best series characters. Mrs. Weasley is even more likeable- she was always rockin' before, but she's even more so now as she's taken over the mothering role for our favorite orphaned wizard. There's a lot of good characters introduced in this one, especially One-Eyed Mad Moody; the professor is a riot and has a twist of a surprise at the end. Sirius is present a lot too, loving the godfather role and protectiveness he feels toward Harry. I feel so bad for him, however, for first he's committed to Azkaban for crimes not committed and now he has to struggle with wanting that connection with Harry so badly because of the loss of his friends. Such sad stuff. Dumbledore has always been a great character, and he's even larger than life than before with plenty of heroic scenes.Hermione has always been likable because she stands out as different - but she is even more so likable now with the S.P.E.W. angle and her passion for fighting for the rights of those who she feels is treated unfairly. We also get to see a further side into the Ministry of Magic, their powerful fingers in all sorts of pies, flawed moral ineptitude, and the potential of all that leading to holes and working against the wizards instead of for them.The story has taken it into darker waters, showing it's definitely not a series just for children anymore. There's a tragic death that affects Harry and others (readers included). You can almost see the graveyard and all scenes through Rowling's talented writing style. She can bring forth a surprising range of depth from her characters from the simplest scenes and events. We even get bizarre mermaids in one particularly riveting scene, a flying dance of dragons, and finally a maze that ends up to a horrific finish.Some people have said this was their favorite - it's not my top favorite of the first four (I preferred Prisoner of Azkaban a little more), but we get more in-depth glimpses into favorite characters, new characters introduced that are amazing, and an excellent adventure into the wild and complex wizarding world that is Harry Potter."},

They are completely unbelievable in how terrible they are to a kid who could grant them every wish under the sun if they were only nicer to him. I mean, they are greedy narcissists. Wouldn't it be more likely that they'd treat Potter's magical ability like a fifty-cent hooker on Half-Off Whoreday? Them wanting to hide his magical magery simply to save face doesn't gel with me, and probably never will. Oh well, moving on... When I picked this fourth book back up (I'm determined to finish this series before the end of 2015) the next 300 pages were... so-so. I didn't hate them. There was a cool part here and there, but I was sorta just hoping it would end. It wasn't until the final third of the book that The Gobbler for Hire gets impossible to put down. And let's be honest. That bit in the graveyard was fucking awesome. I loved how brutal that section was. But what I liked most about this book is the development of the characters. Ron and Hermione especially. If these were older characters I would have been screaming \"Get a fuckin' room already!\" about halfway through the novel. Oh, and the fact that Potter isn't a whiny-ass by the end was a major plus. I dug that none of his friends were able to help this time. Made his character finally shine for me.In summation: This is the best book in the series... so far. I'm really not looking forward to the 850+ doorstop that is book five, but I will nevertheless jump into it next month. At this point, I've forgotten what the last three movies were about. I'm going in with fresh eyes and an open heart. Let's just hope it doesn't eat the booty like a fatman at a porkbutt barbecue.Final Judgment:  "},

I loved this. It was simply extraordinary and unlike any other Harry Potter novel. This was considerably more mature than any of its predecessors. I loved the size of it. It was a book I couldn't get enough of even though it's actual the biggest so far and the most detailed one. Mrs. Rowling never ceases to amaze me.I loved how in each and every book we see how Harry's changing to become the amazing grown-up man he is meant to be. Ron & Hermione & Harry. Our unbeatable trio. They are growing up so fast and it is amazing to read about them and how they overcome everything together. This one was mostly Harry working by himself because it wasn't allowed for him to have any help while participating in the Triwizard Tournament.   U+201CWe are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.U+201DThis marks the beginning of darker times ahead.. This was suprisingly darker and more morbid than any other book. Like Mrs. Rowling had said when this book came out: \"Book Four's a very very VERY important book. Something very important happens in Book Four. But also, it's literally a central book. It's almost the heart of the series, and it's pivotal.\"In this book we see Voldemort for the first time. The first time in his physical form. It's all amazing to read. How he is involved with the Triwizard Tournament and how it all becomes a big mess. There is death and there is suspense, tons of it. There is a kinds-of prom. There is falling in love, and jealousy, for the first time in the Harry Potter series. And it's so breath-taking reading about our favorite characters falling in love, getting their feelings hurts, and tasting rejection for the first time ever.If you've loved the previous books then you're bound to love this one just as much and maybe a little more.

YOU NEED TO READ THIS .. because the movie is not enough whatsoever .. More details and bigger plot.Rowling didnU+2019t leave anything for chance at all .. As if she has been planning for every single word in order to put it in the write place.This Riddle made by the sphinx was my favorite .. I loved it so muchWhat I really loved is what Hagrid said to Harry at the endU+201CwhatU+2019s cominU+2019 will come, and weU+2019ll meet it when it does.U+201DThese were really deep words .. Got the meaning that we should live by in this life .. We shouldnU+2019t think about the Unseen and make our lifes like hell .. We should wait for it and when it happens only then we have to start thinking about it and find a way out of it.It wonU+2019t be my last year at Hogwarts of course and I canU+2019t wait to start my next year with my favorite friends and teachers. See you next year.

My personal feelings differ, but there is literally not a single Harry Potter book that is bad.

As it stands now, my favorites are in the following order: Order, Hallows, Prince, Stone, Prisoner, Goblet and Chamber. Now, be mindful of the fact that they ALL get 5 stars. We are talking about such a small difference in love it is hardly worth commenting on. But, I digress. In Goblet of Fire we encounter all sorts of new and exciting things. We get to see the Quidditch World Cup! We get to see Death Eaters tormenting muggles and muggle-borns! We get to see just how much work goes into hiding the wizarding world from muggles on an everyday basis. We are introduced to Mad-Eye Moody and his intriguing career. We have our minds blown at the what-should-have-been-obvious fact that there are OTHER schools throughout the worldU+2026NOT just Hogwarts. Upon his arrival at Hogwarts after the events of the Quidditch World Cup, Harry is shocked to hear that there will be no Quidditch this year at Hogwarts. However, he can barely register his shock when Dumbledore announces that in its stead Hogwarts will be host to an event that has not happened in over a centuryU+2026.the TriWizard Tournament. Representatives from two other schools will be joining the students and worthy champions will be selected by the Goblet of Fire to compete. Rules are aplenty though, as we find out just why the tournament has not been held in so longU+2026 students have died. So no student under the age of 17 is permitted to enter their name into the goblet. So how does it happen that HarryU+2019s name comes floating out of that Goblet? Being 3 years younger than his fellow champions surely puts him at a disadvantage. There must be dark magic involved. Someone is out to kill HarryU+2026 Goblet of Fire is a fast-paced and exciting read; a wonderful addition to the series and a crucial one. The series starts to take a dark turn here and is just the tip of the iceberg for what happens in the next three. Delee is a first-timer to the series and was supposed to read this one with me, but life happens sometimes and it got set aside temporarily. SheU+2019s lucky I love her as much as I doU+2026or sheU+2019d be locked in my basement with Mr. King and that MahFah Jeff. But, I decided to give her a passU+2026 this time."},

I mean, Rita Skeeter as (view spoiler)[a beetle (hide spoiler)]!!!!!! - gah so good - and, of course, the introduction of Portkeys at the Quidditch World Cup. And the ending, with Priori Incantatem, gets me every time. It's emotional and believable and so inventive. But though I've read this one countless times and I love the ever-expanding Potterverse, this was weirdly enough my least compelling reread. Maybe it's because it was annoying to keep holding together a 700-page book on the muni, or because I was too familiar with the plot and wanted to speed through to the less familiar OOTP. The flaws of this plot - brilliantly engineered though this book is - were too noticeable this time. (view spoiler)[There's this strange tension between everyone believing that whoever entered Harry into the tournament is trying to kill him and the false Moody's mission to get Harry, in one piece, to the graveyard at the end of the book. If false Moody is so determined to get Harry to Voldemort unscathed, why bother to enter him in the tournament at all? Just bewitch some other Portkey and get him out of the school at the end of the year, if Voldemort does indeed need that time to prepare for the ritual.

Anyway, this book is where things start getting dark, and where things always start picking up for me. I mean, I GUESS one could say that they start getting dark with book 3, but for me, the delineation is always book 4 - the first time that we see a character that we actually knew in the story die. Up until this point, death was an offscreen event, or averted in some way. So book 4 is the dividing line for me. After this point, the books get much more \"real\" to me. I love watching Harry grow throughout the series, and I can't wait to get to the next books because these last three are the ones that I wait for the entire series long. "},

Bigotry is intolerance towards those who hold different opinions from oneself. In the Harry Potter Universe this can be clearly read. Pure-bloods, half-bloods, wizards from Muggle decent, wizards who are half-giants all of them are prejudiced. J.K. Rowling displays the reader not to judge someone by their blood but by their actions. The novel is exciting until the ending. Rowling ends all her novels exceptionally well. The closure ends as how a closure of an adventure in oneU+2019s life would end. ItU+2019s smooth. It doesnU+2019t make the reader feel unsatisfactory. Many surprises are present in the novel. Characters are yet again not who they seem to be. I felt particularly betrayed when (view spoiler)[the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Alastor U+2018Mad-EyeU+2019 Moody, turned out to be a Death-Eater who impersonated Alastor to give Harry to He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. The rise of Lord Voldemort was done splendidly and impressively. For instance, I felt scared when he came to power, as if he was rising to power in my world not in the fictional Harry Potter Universe. When all his Death-Eaters came I had the urge to cast one of the Unforgivable Curses on them. (hide spoiler)]The characters, especially Harry, face many challenges which question their braveness, honesty, goodwill, power, wisdom, courage and many other heroic qualities. Harry never fails such a test. I can clearly read HarryU+2019s character and the way he thinks, and what his morals are. Because of this I firmly stood behind him when he faced challenges.The novel is very touching. Because I connected and understood the characters well I sympathised with them as well. I must admit that I cried when (view spoiler)[Mrs Weasley told Harry that it wasnU+2019t his fault that Cedric died. Harry could have never known that their good intentions and goodwill towards each other caused CedricU+2019s tragic ending. (hide spoiler)] I cried a bit as well when (view spoiler)[Dumbledore said to remember Cedric during the Leaving Feast. The characters feel like friends that I have known for four years, since they enrolled Hogwarts. And to see one of them die a horrific death is very dreadful and sickening. (hide spoiler)]The comical aspect of the Harry Potter novels hasnU+2019t faded. From names (RonU+2019s tiny and thin eagle named Pig) to hilarious lettres (from Ron as well) and comments (from the Weasleys in general and once from Amos Diggory (please-men = Muggle police men)), this novel didnU+2019t disappoint. I love how J.K. Rowling makes the novel more light-hearted and easier for the heart by writing some foolishness and hilarity in the novel.

They cut all of the strongest, best scenes and added stupid tacked on scenes that did nothing for the story! Avoid the movie. Read the dang book!

(view spoiler)[I enjoyed Mad-Eye Mood[I enjoyed Mad-Eye MoodThis is my second time reading The Goblet of Fire, and I still (mostly) loved it. The Weasleys' house, the Quidditch World Cup, being at Hogwarts, the tournament, and seeing Harry actually struggle to learn charms and curses - these were all so fun. I love this world, and loved seeing new parts of it. BUT, it's getting dark. I found myself dreading certain parts, knowing what was coming. And with prior knowledge, events seemed even more sinister than before. (view spoiler)[I enjoyed Mad-Eye Moody the first time around, but this time I saw his actions in a completely different light. (hide spoiler)] People are betraying and cursing each other left and right, and even good wizards and witches are just generally being ugly people. Not to mention the killings. This is not a children's adventure story anymore. Honestly, this is where I begin to miss the wonder and charm of the wizarding world that balanced the dark in the first three books. Now everything starts to become tainted by realistic meanness, adolescent angst, real violence and death. So sad. I love the story, but hate some of the things that happen in it. I'm so conflicted! Still a favorite, though.[I enjoyed Mad-Eye Moody the first time around, but this time I saw his actions in a completely different light. (hide spoiler)]"},

So the first 100 or so pages, while they set up some mysteries, kind of bored me. And the finale let me down a little because there was a LOT of info-dumping. But that's it. That's ALL I disliked. CAN I NOW LIST ALL THE AWESOMENESS?(Everyone reviews and reads Harry Potter, so 'scuse me, but I'm not writing a proper review. Go read it, if you haven't. It's awesome.) - The Weasley family.  AS ALWAYS. I will never stop loving Mr and Mrs Weasley. And the whole big family dynamics is spot-on-perfect, and I would know, because I feel like a Weasley in my family sometimes. Fred and George will always make me laugh. LOVE THEM. And Ron. Ron is awesome as well.  - Ron, Hermione and Harry.  They are my all time favourite friendship trio, these days. Except it's getting awkward and strained because BAM PUBERTY. But still. I love them! I  hate  it when they fight though. Gaaah! I feel like Hermione when Harry and Ron had that hissy fit at the beginning. Knock their little heads together.  - Magic school.  It's worth mentioning continually, okay? I want to go to magic school...I waaaaant it.  - Woah, new characters everywhere.  (view spoiler)[ And our first death. WOAH.  (hide spoiler)] I was a wee bit confused with the sheer quantity of people, but hey. That's this series, apparently.  - Riddles and mazes and things!  They always impress me. I like to see if I can figure them out along with the characters. Clue: I cannot.  - Sirus.  Thank you, JK Rowling, for finally getting a grownup who really cares for Harry. Even if said grownup is mostly a dog. BUT I DO HAVE A FROWNIE FACE.  Why the HECK is Snape still hired?? He's a pure teacher-bully and, like, sue him or something, but it's  wrong  the way he treats the Gryffindor students. Not even just Harry! He's downright cruel to Neville and Hermione, too. It's infuriating.So to appease my SNAPE HATE, I rewatch this GIF fifty-two billion times. Then I feel better. BRING ON BOOK #5!!

It becomes difficult to see who can and can't be trusted. JK Rowling is so amazing at creating interesting and layered plots.I really love the smaller characters in this book, such as Winky, Dobby and Pigwidgeon. Every detail is there for a reason and every character is well developed, no matter how small their plot is.Of course the Triwizard Tournament is phenomenal and I never feel like this book is boring, no matter how many times I reread it, as we are always heading towards the next task.I always feel conflicted, especially in Goblet of Fire. I can't decide if I like Dumbledore and respect the decisions he makes, or if I think he is manipulative and nasty for using Harry the way he does."},

I really like this book for it is, as I see it, the one where Rowling finally puts loose ends from the previous ones together.

I really like this book for it is, as I see it, the one where Rowling finally puts loose ends from the previous ones together. This is where the author finally proves that she is not just writing a childrenU+2019s story; she is writing a far more complex symphony of events than anyone could have guessed. As usual, the book begins with Harry feeling miserable, having to endure the Dursleys during one more summer break. This time, however, he has one more reason to look forwards to the end of the summer besides returning to Hogwarts. He has received an invitation from the Weasleys to go to the World Quidditch Cup final! Soon enough, after a hilarious interaction between Dursleys and Weasleys, we get to learn more about the small but wonderful details of WeasleysU+2019 home and way of living.tRowling quickly leads the events to the place where the Quidditch game will happen, and it is fantastic. It is cool seeing wizards from all different parts of the world interacting with each other in other place than Hogwarts. Everybody is anticipating the game and Rowling does a good job of explaining each team through the characters; we end up with enough background to start cheering for one or other team ourselves. The way the game itself was written is really good; I felt almost like I was there watching the whole thing myself. However, the part that I liked the most was when the teams got to display some of their countriesU+2019 magical creatures during the halftime. Leprechauns are interesting, but what really stood out to me were the Veelas, as I had never heard of such a creature.tMoving on from the game, we are back to the camp where the tents are set. Everybody is chilling out inside the WeasleysU+2019 tent, discussing about the game, just having a good time. And that is when everything falls apart. It seems that the dark forces prophesized to arise at the end of the third book have finally awoken. Dark magic from a not too distant past seem to be gathering under a unifying evil power. Differently from previous books, we see Harry and his friends having to face danger and imminent death already at a very early stage of the book, and that is amazing.tFrom this point we are moved almost directly to Hogwarts, where things are also about to change a lot. It seems that the Ministry of Magic has decided it is a good time to bring back an old competition between the best sorcery schools of Europe: the Triwizard Tournament. Therefore, all of a sudden, we have a bunch of new characters thrown into the story, what really hadnU+2019t happened so much in the previous books. That is refreshing but also somewhat disturbing, because we do not know (at least at the beginning) who should be trusted, so that old sense of danger awaiting in the corners is back. tThe whole book follows the events set for the competition and, during this process, we get to see significant character development. The message is clear: it is not a childrenU+2019s book anymore. There is conflict, all drama that comes with becoming a teenager, even a little bit of teenage love starts being explored by the author. It is also a different experience seeing Hermione being interested in social/revolutionary causes, instead of just being a bookworm.tAs the story moves on it gets darker and darker. It is not a book for attached people; people die here and you might not be ok with that. At the end, we are thrown in a hurricane of nightmares; Harry, despite his young age, has to face once again forces too powerful and too evil for his abilities. The end is very emotional, dark and it sets the crescendo for the symphony that this story is.: there is no more room for happiness and innocence, war is coming.  Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review:  If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.  It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.  Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it."},

I really wish I could play Quidditch! Alas, I'll have to settle for Ultimate. The first glorious 200 pages of this book are spent mostly on Quidditch and the Weasleys. I could not ask for better!!The Weasleys are awesome as always. The fireplace. Fred and George vs. Dudley. Speaking of which, Hermione is an awesome friend! I loved her character in this book so much better than the previous books. And I loathed Rita Skeeter. I'm right with Hermione on wanting to find a way to stop her.

So after term it will be. *sigh*I've always heard Harry Potter described as fantasy. I didn't know they were mysteries!

I've found that Ron and Harry are pretty much the same as they were since the beginning, and I've never really much enjoyed Harry as a character anyway (how much better would it be if Neville were the protagonist? Funnier, in any case), but the way Hermione handled herself, spoke to others (both those her own age and those older or younger) and just her general demeanour was nice to read about. I also thought Molly really came in to her own, too, though I'm surprised there isn't more Ginny around in these first four books considering how bleedin' important she becomes later on.The plot never really grabbed me and I don't think it ever had. I can barely remember anything of the film at all either (about to be re-watched later...). I've found that a lot of the things that happen are just co-incidental, or seem that way. I also think it's quite infuriating the way magic is used in such a blasU+00E9 manner: oh, one night to grow back bones? How handy. A specific spell for that one specific problem? How handy. There being hardly any consequences for doing any kind of magic? How handy. The magic system isn't the best and I feel like it's become quite background, until it's needed to disarm or kill or something, and I find that I kind of skip over the magical elements that are wand-provided.I'm still not really feeling the vibe and at this point I can't see myself re-reading them ever again, though the next book has Luna and everyone bloody loves Luna, which oddly hasn't put me off her like it usually would other things. If anyone can make me feel the magic, it's Luna."},

The writing seemed to lack subtlety and nuance in certain places, becoming rather cheesy rather than charming as Rowling wished to allude to. Further the fact that you have heroes in these novels who are witches and wizards without a sense of proper limitation on their power (aside from that some witches and wizards are just stronger and naturally better than others) irked me. But that all said I finally found plenty more to enjoy in this fourth novel in the series and am already moving onto the fifth novel.The strength of this novel is in the overall worldbuilding. Rowling has created a world of magic that you would almost want to visit, yet in the previous novels I also felt that this magical world was too 'safe'. Sure you had trolls, dragons and werewolves, but there wasn't this real sense of danger. Not so with The Goblet of Fire. Indeed everything from characterization, plotting and overall writing seems to have improved in this novel - although Rowling also becomes much more incredibly lengthy in how she writes. I'm rather glad, this all said, that I didn't read these novels when they were hyped up exercises in marketing. I feel that I would have been disappointed in returning to read them again as a young adult in my early twenties as it were. Not to mention that I previously had little desire to dive into the world of these novels. So that all said I would actually recommend getting young teens (rather than children) to read these novels by themselves, or would use them and read them with young children. I would, however, prefer to direct teens to other books that I find to be better on the whole but you can't deny there is a certain charm to these novels that rubs off on the reader... They feel somewhat like timeless children's novels and I have no doubt that they will continue to be read in the future."},

I was amazed that on this, my third time reading this book, I was still biting my nails just as soon as Harry entered the maze at the end. I knew what was coming and it really gave me deep sads to think about where it all would lead. I said in my last update that it was wonderful to watch the kids growing up and I'll only add to that that it comes together with the series growing up as well. We see it take a turn for the dark here. I know people give Harry a lot of flack for being angsty, but can you just imagine? I get so frustrated for him and how no one ever believes him, starting with not putting his name into the Goblet of Fire and ending with Voldemort's return. Plus, he now feels directly responsible for the return of Voldemort and the death of Cedric Diggory. I have bad associations with Cedric and Robert Pattison, and that's unfortunate, because Cedric is a great character. When Dumbledore gives his \"Remember Cedric\" speech, there were definitely sniffles happening. I LOVED Hermione in this book. In a lot of ways, she's super self-confident. She tends to be so above the teasing and prickling of the other students. When she gets it in for Rita Skeeter, she is just CONFIDENT that she's going to stop her and show her. And she does because Hermione is the best forever. Yes, she can be a bit rigid, but Harry and Ron are so lucky to have her as a friend. So much gets done because Hermione gets it done. It's interesting, though, that it's in this same book that we get the scene with Hermione's teeth growing. This is a good a time as any to mention how much I HATE Snape. He made fun of a 14-year-old girl's appearance so much, it pushes her to permanently change her appearance. WHO DEFENDS THIS CREATURE? PLEASE STOP HE'S AWFUL. He also reads one of Rita's columns out loud in class so all the other students can laugh at Harry and Hermione. Also, when Harry goes running to fetch Dumbledore because Barty Crouch appeared from the forest, Snape just stops him because it pleases him to be mean to Harry. I hate him so much. Whenever I think of Sirius, I think of how hard I fell in love with him in what seems a short amount of time. I saw a little more clearly why in this book, where his presence is pretty constant throughout. Sirius really cares for Harry and it's so nice that Harry has that. There is this whole scene at the beginning where Harry needs to tell someone about his scar and he can't think of who, but then it dawns on him that he has Sirius now. He's never had that kind of person to turn to and it's just... gah. Feelings. Feelings right up until Sirius has to leave at the end and Harry's like \"WAIT! NO!\" No, please Sirius. Don't leave. Dear goodness, THE WEASLEYS. They are warmth and love and humor and caring and I LOVE THEM SO MUCH. From Mr. Weasley at the beginning, running off with his older sons to see about the dark mark, to Mrs. Weasley and Bill coming as Harry's family before the last task. I forgot they showed up and when Harry walks into that room and Mrs. Weasley is there and he just lights up... So good. And then at the end when Molly gives Harry a hug and it's the first time he can feel his feelings about everything that's happened. He says that no one has ever hugged him this way, like a mother. I might cry right now just typing this. Finally, J.K. Rowling is so very specific about every element she introduces into the world. Every once in a while, it comes off a little convenient, but for the most part, I appreciate how intentional and connected and foreshadowed everything is. At the beginning of the story, she tells us about port keys for the first time as they are whisked away to the Quidditch World Cup. At the end of the story, it's a port key that takes Harry to face Voldemort. A couple of books ago, Dumbledore straight up told Harry that it's possible that some part of Voldemort is in Harry and this book, Voldemort talks about the measures he took to evade death. There are so many other things like this and I love it. I'm hesitant to go on. Bad things happen, guys. Very bad things.[December 25, 2013] - Marking for reread. I remember that the first time through, I marveled at how Rowling was growing these characters up before our eyes. Their first dance and the changing dynamics of their relationships. Bigger challenges and very real danger. Death. This time, I suffered for Harry more, knowing what is still ahead of him, and resenting Ron even while understanding him. Sirius, though. God I love that man."},

We see Harry go through some real challenges in this book, and not just the ones that Voldy cooked up through his devious evility, but challenges that any normal teen may go through... jealousy, a strained-to-the-breaking-point friendship, a crush, and bullying... and that's a day in Harry's life BEFORE anyone tries to kill him. There's something about these books that just pulls my heartstrings, too... and his name is Ron. I love love love love Ron. He is my favorite character, by far, of the series. It breaks my heart a little to see him wearing too-short PJs, and it's embarrassing to me, both on Ron's behalf and for Harry, to know that Harry sees it, acknowledges and pities Ron for it, but disregards it in his anger. And Ron's reaction to Harry's anger, or lack of one, speaks volumes, and breaks my heart still more. And this is the kind of thing that I love about JKR's writing. That scene seems so simple on the surface - Ron interrupts Harry when he's trying to talk to Snuffles, and since Ron has been acting like a jerk, Harry uses the interruption to vent his frustration. But what's implied, and what's NOT said are what makes the scene so emotionally powerful to me. And every single time I tear up. There are some things that I noticed on this 374th reading of the book that stood out as improbable, like how does Voldemort keep his wand for 13 years of being incorporeal? Someone else would have had to have held onto it for him, but if that's the case, why wouldn't they have helped him arise again? And likewise, I find it hard to believe that Voldy did ZERO magic between killing Lily Potter and then killing Bertha Jorkins 13 years later. Priori Incantatem shows the spells that a wand has performed... It showed the hand that Voldemort had conjured for Wormtail, and screaming to indicate the Cruciatus curse he used on Harry, so why did it not reflect any of the magic he'd have had to do to get to Bertha's memories? Likely this is just due to the amount of time that it would have needed to show them all, but some sort of explanation would be better than none. But still... I love this book, and there's a reason why it was my favorite for so long. I love the emotional impact of this book, and how draining it is to read. I love that I finish this book with tears in my eyes and an ache in my heart for the things that I know are coming... but I can't help but want more. "},

'The terror it inspired...you have no idea, you're too young. Just picture coming home, and finding the Dark Mark hovering over your house, and knowing what you're about to find inside...' Mr Weasley winced. 'Everyone's worst fear...the very worst...'-----------------------------------------------------  MOMENT #6: *The Triwizard Tournament*-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #7: The arrival of Mad-Eye MoodyA man stood in the doorway, leaning upon a long staff, shrouded in a black travelling cloak. The lightening had thrown the man's face into sharp relief and it was a face unlike any Harry had ever seen.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #8:'Don't talk to me,' Ron said quietly.'Why not?' said Hermione in surprise.'Because I want to fix that in my memory for ever,' said Ron, his eyes closed and an uplifted expression on his face. 'Draco Malfoy, the amazing bouncing ferret...'----------------------------------------------------- MOMENT #9:'Now...those three curses - Avada Kedavra, Imperius and Cruciatus - are known as the Unforgivable Curses. The use of any one of them on a fellow human being is enough to earn a life sentence in Azkaban. That's what you're up against.'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #10: \"Spew\"?' said Harry, picking up a badge and looking at it. 'What's this about?''Not spew,' said Hermione impatiently. 'It's S - P - E - W. Stands for the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #11:'I don't believe it!' Ron said, in a stunned voice. 'Krum, Harry! Viktor Krum!'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #12:Dumbledore reached inside, and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden cup. It would have been entirely unremarkable, had it not been full to the brim with dancing, blue-white flames.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #13:- but next moment, there was a loud sizzling sound, and both twins were hurled out of the golden circle as though they had been thrown by an invisible shot-putter. They landed painfully, ten feet away on the cold stone floor, and to add insult to injury, there was a loud popping noise, and both of them sprouted identical, long white beards.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #15:And then Dumbledore cleared his throat, and read out - 'Harry Potter'----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #16: *The Four Champions*-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #17: 'Dumbledore!' cried Rita Skeeter, with every appearance of delight. 'I hope you saw my piece over the summer about the International Confederation of Wizards' Conference?''Enchantingly nasty,' said Dumbledore, his eyes twinkling. 'I particularly enjoyed your description of me as an obsolete dingbat.'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #18:'...but I tell you this, I don't envy the one who gets the Horntail. Vicious thing. It's back end's as dangerous as its front, look.'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #19: *The First Task*-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #20: *The Unexpected Task*'The Yule Ball is of course a chance for all of us to - er - let our hair down,' she said, in a disapproving voice.Harry could see what was funny this time: Professor McGonagall, with her hair in a tight bun, looked as though she had never let hair down in any sense.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #21: *THE YULE BALL*-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #22: 'I don't know who Maxime thinks she's kidding,' Harry said. 'If Hagrid's half-giant, she definitely is. Big bones...the only thing that's got bigger bones than her is a dinosaur.'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #23:'Well, if you don't like it, you know what the solution is, don't you?' yelled Hermione.'Oh yeah?' Ron yelled back. 'What's that?'Next time there's a ball, ask me before someone else does, and not as a last resort!'     -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #24: *  Rita Skeeter's Scoop*-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #25: *The Second Task*-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #26: 'Yes,' said Hermione in a heated voice, 'he sacked her, just because she hadn't stayed in her tent and let herself get trampled -'  'Hermione, will you give it a rest with the elf!' said Ron.But Sirius shook his head and said, 'She's got the measure of Crouch better than you have, Ron.'  -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #27:'This is called a Pensieve. One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure.'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #28:   *The Third Task*-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #29:Cedric was lying spread-eagled on the ground beside him. He was dead.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #30:...and Harry stared back into the face that had haunted his nightmares for three years. Whiter than a skull. with wide, livid scarlet eyes, and a nose that was as flat as a snake's, with slits for nostrils...   Lord Voldemort had risen again.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #31:'His mother left upon him the traces of her sacrifice...this is old magic, I should have remembered it, I was foolish to overlook it...but no matter. I can touch him now.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #32: And as he heard Voldemort draw nearer still, he knew one thing only, and it was beyond fear or reason - he was not going to die crouching here like a child playing hide-and-seek; he was going to die upright like his father, and he was going to die trying to defend himself, even if no defense was possible... -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #33: *Priori Incantatem*'When the connection is broken, we will linger for only moments ... but we will give you time...you must get to the Portkey, it will return you to Hogwarts...do you understand, Harry?'  -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #34: -----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #35:Harry saw a man lying before him, pale-skinned, slightly freckled, with a mop of fair hair. He knew who he was.-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #36: *The Parting of the Ways*'I tell you now - take the steps I have suggested, and you will be remembered, in office or out, as one of the bravest and greatest Ministers for Magic we have ever known. Fail to act - and history will remember you as the man who stepped aside, and allowed Voldemort a second chance to destroy the world we have tried to rebuild!'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #37: 'It is my belief, however, that the truth is generally preferable to lies, and that any attempt to pretend that Cedric died as a result of an accident, or some sort of blunder, is an insult to his memory.'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #38:-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #39:  'Lord Voldemort's gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.'-----------------------------------------------------MOMENT #40:'Listen.' said Harry firmly. 'If you don't take it, I'm throwing it down the drain. I don't want it and I don't need it. But I could do with a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs. I've got a feeling we're going to need them more than usual before long.'  -----------------------------------------------------"},

{"rating": 5, "text": "Gosh I love book 4!! It's still got such a happy tone but it's the start of the dark stuff! Not to mention I love the tasks and meeting other wizards from other countries! Once again, here are little tidbits about the book and some things I noticed differing from the movie.-I think it would have been important for the movie to tell us that the house at the beginning is the Riddle house. -I am noticing this as a trend in every book.. in the book it's Harry's idea to write to Sirius about his scarGosh I love book 4!! It's still got such a happy tone but it's the start of the dark stuff! Not to mention I love the tasks and meeting other wizards from other countries! Once again, here are little tidbits about the book and some things I noticed differing from the movie.-I think it would have been important for the movie to tell us that the house at the beginning is the Riddle house. -I am noticing this as a trend in every book.. in the book it's Harry's idea to write to Sirius about his scar hurting and yet in the movie it's Hermione's idea. It makes it look like Harry is too dumb to figure it out and that Hermione is the one that has to think for them all. It undermines Harry and Ron and I don't really see why they continuously do this every movie.-I love that JK developed the Dursley's as characters so well when they are not really central to the story at all.-Watching the Weasley's with the muggle world is always hilarious. The entire scene when they pick up Harry is hilarious. I'm upset it's not in the movie because it's the best scene.-I love that Harry taunts the Dursley's with Sirius to get them to be nicer to him.-I wish they included Bill and Charlie in the movies. We never get to meet Charlie and Bill is only a small figure in the last 2 movies. It was fun meeting them at the triwizard tournament. And of course more Percy which the movie has too little of anyways.-I love Pidwidgeon so much and I am sad he wasn't in the movie. -The movies don't ever explain what apparating is or how/when they learn it. Not to mention that they never explain splinching, even when it happens to Ron.-Since a random old boot is their portkey, I'll always wonder if trash on the street is a portkey. -They always ask Harry for muggle help even though Hermione is also a muggle? Why not also ask Hermione?-Super curious if Dean and Seamus were ever really gay.-I LOVE that Barty Crouch calls Percy Weatherby.-I don't get it in the movie where Draco has to comment how poor the seats are and how they have seats in the ministers box when the teams come out of their seat. And lets not forget in the book that they are all in the SAME box.-Winky though -Veela are hilarious. I would have liked to see them, and even a LITTLE bit of the world cup stuff in the movie.-The entire dark mark death eaters scene was horribly done.-S.P.E.W - I will forgive Hermione for this. It was one of the most irritating things to read. She had sincere intentions but was really annoying with it after a while. Everyone (including the house elves) TOLD her that they don't want to be paid.-Hedwig's sass is my favourite.-The Goblet of Fire/Tournament stuff is all out of order in the movie.-I hate that classes become so unimportant in the movies starting now. Classes are the best part sometimes!-Why are the Pavil twins in the same house in the movie? And also they aren't identical in the movie but they are in the book?-Why is Beauxbatons an all girl school? Is it so hard to imagine that the cup picked a girl? Or is it only possible that a girl would be picked if there was no other choice. Clearly ridiculous. And why is Durmstrang an all boy school though.-Everyone's most hated thing: HARRY DID YOU PUT YOU NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIRE?!?!?! \"said Dumbledore calmly\" yeah real calm movie.-Why was Harry so stressed in the book about the summoning spell for his broom? Worrying that it might not make it all the way? Like get Hermione to hide your broom somewhere near by so you know it'll be quicker.-The entire first task scene was horrible in the movie? The rooftop showdown? wtf?-There was also no point system..-I wonder why the Yule ball was only open to fourth years and above? Would it have only been 6/7 years if Harry wasn't in it?-So umm everyone wants to go to the ball with Harry in the book and no one does in the movie?-Hermione's PERIWINKLE BLUE dress. I wish we saw that.-The best thing though is Herm-Own-Ninny-Maxine + Hagrid fighting over being a giant would have been fun in the movie.-which makes me wonder how Hagrid's mom had sex with his dad like I am really curious about this.-The movie entirely cut out Ludo Bagman like he was not important at all. -I prefer book Dumbledore to movie Dumbledore. Movie Dumbledore is kind of an ass.-Does Harry ever get his Mauraders Map back from Moody?-Also why is Hermione Krum's closest person? That's weird.-Dobby is so precious I'm sad they cut him out of the movies.-Krum talking to Harry about his flying would have been fun.-Krum says \"your ministry...\" does that mean that each country has their own? -What do Ron and Hermione end up doing as jobs when they graduate (im sure this will be answered to me eventually...)-I love that in the end Mrs. Weasley got Hermione and Harry as children too. You can tell that she wanted Ron and Hermione together all along though because she gets mad at Hermione for \"dating\" Harry.-If they know Lucius Malfoy is a death eater why do they continue to let Draco come back to Hogwarts?-The Graveyard scene was actually well done in the movie surprisingly.-Clearly the Potter gene is really strong since his mom and his wife have red hair and his children still have dark hair.-I don't see why they cut out the Winky/Crouch story at the end, it's really quite important the the events of the movie.-They basically cut out Sirius from the movie and that pisses me off he's so prominent in the movie, the end especially.-Also why does Harry never cry. That seems a little unrealistic to me tbh.-The movies just never say what happens to Crouch JR? -I like that they set up the Order a bit at the end, even though the reader doesn't really know about it yet.-I liked reading that Dumbledore makes Harry go back to the Dursley's ever summer and I liked knowing that Mrs. Weasley at least invites him for Christmas and Summer. -I am sad the movie cut out so much Krum he seems like a stupid dumbbell in the movies but he's really actually great in the movies. Plus I liked his and Hermione's romance.-I just wish more than anything we see Harry giving Fred and George the money from his winning because that explains their storyline so much but nope movie just makes it look like Fred and George have always been rich.Time for book 5. Not my favourite at all but still looking forward to it!"},

I knew I had to get them and listen non-stop. I LOVE IT. Yes, I have the book but mostly stuck to the narration because it was so good - that's a recommendation for everyone btw, go check it out if you haven't already!I don't even remember much about the movie and therefore I was constantly surprised/confused and awestruck while listening because I forgot almost everything. There were certain things that I remembered, of course, but others I just completely forgot. IT WAS AWESOME. It's like I was experiencing this whole adventure from the scratch! However, I don't seem to be able to form proper words to express my love, therefore I'll just make a list with things I loved and things that bothered me a little.      \"It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.\"    Things I loved:- The Weasley's: they're like one of my FAVORITE familes ever. I adore each and everyone so, so much and care so deeply for them! Mr and Mrs Weasley are amazing and always make me smile, as well as Fred and George. They're so funny! I already expressed my love for Ron in the previous reviews but again here: I ADORE HIM.- Sirius Black: HE'S ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHARACTERS, OKAY? Honestly, I loved him in book 3 and am so happy that he also was a part of this book (even if just a small one). How much he cares for Harry and how he's trying to protect him and be there for him even though it's dangerous ... goooosh!- DRAGONS: I didn't remember dragons from the movie??? Like, WHERE WERE THEY?! It was so epic to read about them ... I don't even need to say more, right? Dragons are epic. Enough said.- CU+00C9DRIC DIGGORY: Yes, my heart broke for him. That's one detail I remembered and it was as sad as I expected it to be. Maybe even more so. I was heartbroken. *cries* I think a Harry/CU+00E9dric friendship would've been great.- THE ENDING: I was listening to it on the train and when a certain thing was revealed I was like: \"WHAAAT?!? No, that can't be true!!!\" Honestly, I was SHOCKED. You can ask Melissa, she has proof.   Things I didn't like:- Ron & Harry fighting: excuse me but I was starting to get a little bit annoyed with their fight ... it went on for sooooo long over something so stupid and I just wanted to force them to talk with each other again. They were both acting incredibly childish, ugh.- My own stupidity: Apparently I haven't even SEEN the movie?! Ignore all comments I made about having seen it ... I most certainly haven't! I can't believe it but the more and more I listened/read and the further I got, the less I \"remembered\". I think someone just spoiled me or I saw pictures/gifs somewhere on the internet but I haven't actually seen the movie. I don't know how I was able to do that but don't worry, I'll get to it right now! By the time this review is up, I already watched it, wohoo!- Some parts were too long: I don't really know how else to describe it but some things just dragged ... they went on and on and on and I was wondering when something else would be happening again.      \"We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.\"  Obviously, these negative things didn't stop me from loving this book. I enjoyed it a lot and already can't wait to get my hands on book 5 ... although I still haven't decided if I'll read it or listen to the audiobook again. Maybe I'll do both, haha. So please, everyone who hasn't started the Harry Potter series yet: GO DO IT NOW. It's worth it!www.aworldbetweenfoldedpages.blogspot.com_____________________  February 20th:The audiobooks are so great ... I love them! Another amazing book - I realized while reading that apparently I've never even seen the movie. I did now though, haha. LOVED IT."},

I just always put the book down and think.My opinion on the book: The fourth year of Harry Potter was amazing! At first, I was so intrigued in how the Riddles became who they are. J.K. Rowling's writing is absolutely amazing and very unpredictable.I always make predictions, and they turn up, wrong. The ending of these books will want you buying/borrowing the next book right away! The battle between You-Know-Who and Harry was brilliant! That part from the Third Task started to the end was easily captivating!

(Hint: If you're reading this, I decided to post.)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Who else remembers seeing this monster for the first time? I believe I was in the 8th grade when it made its debut. Now, I was not quite old enough to hang out at midnight book releases (though this was the last Potter book that I didn't go to one) or even to really keep up with release dates of things (I know, shameful), but fortunately I had that cool Uncle I mentioned back in my review for Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Uncle Mike kept up with all big-time book, movie, and tv premieres and made it his solemn duty to be sure that the kids related to him would be on top of things.So, even though I was not really even fully aware it was out, Uncle Mike snagged me a copy on the release day and gave it to me as a (two month early) birthday present. At the time, my cousin and I had somewhat of an unhealthily competitive relationship, so we entered into an unspoken race to see who would finish first. I'm sure we each have our own version of how things went down, but dear goodreads readers-- believe me when I tell you I totally got this one in the bag. And if you've seen the size of this thing, you know that is a serious victory.Yes. It is a big book-- for a kid, it almost feels as daunting as cracking open the bible. Luckily, it reads a little faster (and that's coming from a Christian). For the first time, we are given a look into some of the wizardry outside Hogwarts-- and it's awesome. Beauxbatons and Durmstang-- two wizarding schools which differ largely from Hogwarts. Harry is entered against his will into what is known as \"The Triwizard Tournament\" to compete against members of other schools in various tests of skill, strength, and courage. The winner is awarded a buttload of galleons, a pretty little cup, and you know-- glory and stuff. Though Harry is initially a little freaked over his name mysteriously being entered, he's still successful in the competition...to no one's surprise.One of the most notable happenings in the book is that painful Ron/Harry feud which, when Ron is your favorite character, seems to last an eternity, but is in reality a fairly short portion of the book. Even though he acted a fool, I stand by my man-- it has to be hard living in Harry's shadow. And speaking of my man, or, uh, Hermione's man to be more precise-- how can you not love the first sure-fire sign of their feelings for one another at the Yule Ball? It doesn't get played nearly as well in the movie, (through no fault of Rupert Grint or Emma Watson) but that is some fun stuff in the book. I also like that Harry gets turned down by Cho. I know-- it sounds terrible, but no one should have everything come easy to them. From the fun and frivolous ball to the quirky, entertaining competition tasks, much of the book maintains its usual light tone. But there's a reason this book is as big as it is; it's hiding one hell of a punch to the gut.SPOILER!!!!He-who-must-not-be-named returns. And he sucks. Hard.Cedric Diggory, Harry's fellow Hogwarts competitor, is dealt a quick but cruel death, the first significant one of the series. I, for one, was not expecting it. I mean I always figured ol' Voldy would come back, it just didn't enter my wee little brain that that would mean characters I cared about might actually, you know, die.Then right after the sobfest that is Cedric's death, Harry is reuinted with his parents for a brief moment. It is beautiful and tragic and at that point in my life, I had never read anything like it. The value Rowling intends to instill with the conclusion of the story-- that we need not separate ourselves so fiercely, even though our differences might be great, is one that's important to all people groups. Yes, even us stuffy Christians;) Thought this is the fourth book, it feels oddly like the beginning. I can't wait to write my next reviews. Thanks for reading (I don't know why I've gone strangely formal). So how did I do in a review in which I actually talk about the plot?"},

Then you've got Harry's first crush and I looked like this every time he got all shy about talking to Cho or whenever he thought about her or when he got jealous of Cedric.He's just so precious! There were so many funny moments in this book. I found myself chuckling a lot, especially when the Weasley twins were mentioned.Then came the part where all the laughing stopped.Oh, how the tears did flow. It was the first actual death to occur in the books, and it set the dark tone for the rest of the series. Cedric's death is what I consider to be the official point where everything starts falling apart for Harry. Poor Harry had to witness Cedric's pointless death. He was tied to a gravestone and tortured. He was forced to give his own blood to revive his mortal enemy and to see him return to his former strength before his eyes. Voldemort played with Harry like a cat plays with a mouse before eating it. He saw his dead parents' ghosts. All this...and he's only fourteen. He. Is. A. Child. I just can't get over that. This amazingly brave, heroic boy was staring death in the face, and all he could think about was dying like a man, not cowering at Voldemort's feet. I have such immense respect and love for this boy, and at the same time my heart bleeds for him. He goes through hell and back that night, and when he's forced to relive everything, all those unthinkable horrors, that bastard Fudge calls him crazy and a liar. Ooh, that Fudge. I just wanna...I just wanna...One other guy that had me feeling super stabby was Lucius freaking Malfoy. How can he stand there and watch all this stuff happen to Harry when he has a son exactly his age? Does he ever think to himself that it could be Draco tied to that gravestone? Ugh. And don't even get me started on flipping Wormtail. I could kill that rat with my bare hands. The Potters trusted him and he willingly causes Harry so much pain just to preserve the pointless, torturous life that he has, a life that many would consider worse than death. Imagine being Voldemort's babysitter night and day, doing his dirty work, feeding him, milking his snake. *shudders* Wouldn't you rather die with honor and some sort of self-respect? I just can't with this guy. Look at him. Just look at that CREEP.And that Barty Crouch Jr.? Even creepier than Voldemort,And Rita Skeeter? Yeah, I'd throttle her too.In the end, there are no books that can compare to this series. The more I read it, the more I love it. Even though this one was probably my least favorite in the series (tied with CoS), I still love it more than any other non-HP book I've ever read. JK Rowling, is nothing less than an artist."},

You have the beginning with HP's evil family, his fat cousin yadda yadda. Then you get to go to Hogwarts and there is a first year ceremony yadda yadda. Hagrid has some crazy creature, the school needs a new dark arts teacher, Malfoy is mean to poor little HP. In the end HP is the victor and he ends up going home to, you guessed it, the mean family. Blech. Wouldn't it be nice if maybe, I don't know, a book took place in the summer or something?? Such confining plot points Rowling!The Quidditch tournament was the feature of the first 130+ pages (seriously?) and it was mind-numbingly boring. Okay Rowling you invented a tedious, screwed up sport and now you want to bore us to tears with it. I don't want to READ a freakin play-by-play of any sport, especially not a made up one! Hockey is my absolute favorite sport but you will not catch me reading play-by-play of it! No! And the Quidditch is so freakin corrupt too, WTF is that saying to the kids reading the books?? And then after the tournament is over we get to go to Hogwarts, *oh joy*.The \"plot\", if you wish to call it that, in this one was rather weak. And the length of the novel did nothing to help. This one could have easily been as long as the previous three without anything of import being taken out. Such as the \"romantic\" drama and the dance in the book, really? Totally unnecessary. The \"evil\" guy in this one could have done such a simple thing to accomplish his goal and instead we had to sit through 700+ pages to get to the end. Oye. (view spoiler)[The bad guy could have just bypassed the tournament by using a portkey at any time to get HP to Voldemort, especially since he spoke to HP all the time. The entire tournament was unnecessary. (hide spoiler)]And the worst part of this book and a fault of the others? Harry Potter. My god he is dull. Why does he have to be the center of attention? Hermione is by far a more interesting character since she actually,*gasp*, has some depth. What the hell does HP have? A scar? Weird friends? A crazy family history? Sure these facts may be interesting but HE is NOT. Another issue with HP is the fact that you know in the end that no matter what happens HP will be fine. You never truly fear for him and therefore are never convinced of what is happening. It leaves you feeling annoyed rather than anything positive because you cannot help but think \"Who or What is going to save poor little Harry now?\" Sure in other series you KNOW the character will survive because there are x number of books published/planned, but in the good ones you don't quite know how the character is going to actually come out in the end....*gasp* they might actually be altered in some way! NOOOO Oh and who the hell didn't know that Harry would be in the wizard tournament? Age restriction? Pfft! Not for precious HP, the personality-less wonder! Someone please tell me HP dies in the end? Oh forget it, I know that would never happen.I am so tired of HP and Hogwarts and the predictability that I don't know if I will even finish the series at this point. I've been told that the story really takes off in book 4 and gets darker. To that I say HA![The bad guy could have just bypassed the tournament by using a portkey at any time to get HP to Voldemort, especially since he spoke to HP all the time.

But they're also starting to learn more about the world around them and struggle with more complicated ethical concepts (an example is Hermione and the welfare house elves). It is these challenging concepts and times that I really like to read about. Another great thing about this was Harry getting smarter and using his brain in the tournament! I was so proud of him.  The plot is becoming more complexAs the characters grow up and the books get longer. the plot also becomes more complex and I love it! There are more plot lines being juggled, more struggles for the characters to face and overcome, higher stakes and character deaths, and many more feels. There are no longer easy, simple solutions to small problems. It makes reading a lot more interesting and the book harder to put down.  Magic is awesomeThe magical world is so cool. I really love losing myself in it. So many strange magical creatures and gadgets and spells. The creatures add a thrilling, suspenseful element to the story, especially with things like dragons in the tournament. And the magical gadgets I really just want in my life honestly. A TARDIS tent that is bigger on the inside would be so handy, not to mention a time turner for study or a chest that opens into multiple compartments in different dimensions.  Hello old VoldyThe dark lord has finally graced us with his full presence in a novel! I have been waiting four books for this moment. Voldemort is such an interesting and terrifying villain, it's exciting to have his plans finally start to take fruition and watch him struggle against Harry. And with the return of Voldemort and the death eaters things are finally getting much, much darker and deadly. I'm so ready for more.  It actually shocked meDespite having seen the movie before reading the book, I was still completely taken by surprise by a twist I should have known was coming [spoiler] that Barty Crouch Jr. was pretending to be Moody[/spoiler]. I was absolutely shocked. What a brilliant turn of events it was. I can only hope such good twists and betrayals continue in the future books because that's going to start making me feel many emotions.  In SummaryHARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE was the instalment I've been waiting for. Things are finally getting incredibly dark and Voldemort is becoming more involved. I cannot wait to continue this story further and see where THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX takes me next."},

I donU+2019t want to say this book was boring because it wasnU+2019t, but there were definitely sections that were less interesting than the rest of the books and then the rest of the series. The sections between the tasks of the Tournament dragged though I know now that they set up a lot for the last few chapters. Those were completely insane! Everything just got so real and intense and just plain heavy. Voldemort is back and no one but a few people actually believe Harry when he tells everyone. Honestly, I feel like those last few chapters made the overall slow book worth it. I donU+2019t know how I feel about Harry in this book. It felt like there was no real character development with him, I felt him to be the same as in the previous book. All that happened was that he got to suffer and be in pain more which does affect him but really late in the book and you donU+2019t see the repercussions until later. I found Ron to be super shallow in this book. I understood where heU+2019s coming from, it must be hard to be best friends with someone who always has the attention, who always saves the day but thatU+2019s not a reason to turn your back on him and be distrustful of his intentions. ThereU+2019s no way Harry would purposely cheat to get into a tournament where he could die. And it bothered me that Ron would act like a little brat and make it about him, it was annoying. Hermoine is just a plain freaking badass. I love her more and more in every book. She tried to keep the peace, she tried to be honest and true to herself and then she just made sure that everyone knew that she was boss and she wasnU+2019t going to take degradation of her character lying down. I love her so much. SheU+2019s officially my favorite character in this series. Dobby was super duper cute. I love his personality. And now that heU+2019s not ruining HarryU+2019s chances of going back to Hogwarts, I can connect with him a lot more. IU+2019m super looking forward to continuing the series even though things will only get heavier from here."},

Even though school quidditch was canceled for the Triwizard Tournament, quidditch was still present, but in a different format. It was fun to be introduced to wizards from all over the world and all the different ways they try to live in a muggle world. I also really loved to get the spectator viewpoint of quidditch, rather than that of a player. It's such a fun section of the book.The blossoming love of Ron and Hermione.

The graveyard scene is terrifying and intriguing and heavy, and the following scenes are like the end to a great mystery.There's less SNAPE/MALFOY DID IT too, thank goodness, because that gets annoying at times.I really hate how Ron treats Harry in the beginning, but it was slowly built over the previous books, and realistic for teenagers to fight, and so it made complete sense and adds more layers to their friendship and Ron's character growth, which is lovely.And finally, Cedric Diggory.

AdemU+00E1s se nota un gran cambio en los personajes principales (Harry, Ron y Hermione), ya no son tan niU+00F1os como al principio y se palpa la adolescencia en ellos, que por cierto me han hecho reU+00EDr en muchas ocasiones con los celos y riU+00F1as tontas que tienen entre ellos.

Me ha gustado pero no tanto como el tercero (que sigue siendo mi favorito), supongo que lo de recordar casi la mitad del libro no ha ayudado, pero que no cunda el pU+00E1nico que voy a seguir con la saga.

Quidditch now makes even less sense during the world cup, the most important championship in the magic world. ItU+2019s not a school completion where you can ignore the unfairness, this is supposed to treated properly. And yet we see the mascots of each team bribing the crowds with gold or seducing the referees to ignore fair play. The professional players were as civilized as apes on heat and didnU+2019t miss the chance to brawl with each other just for the heck of it. As for the actual duration of the match, the players were moving so fast, that the on-lookers needed magic devises to slow down the scenes. It makes no sense, since while they are watching the slow motion, they miss the live action, which is the whole point of being there. And considering how they needed weeks of preparations and disguising their looks to resemble normal people, going to all the trouble just to be in a match where they canU+2019t even see the players moving, just so everything will end in less than an hour is simply not worth it.Misdirected fameHarryU+2019s legend grows even further! Adding to his title of greatest hero for not doing anything and savior of all oppressed people for not doing anything, now he is also the champion of Hogwarts. Guess why. I bet you know it alreadyU+2026 Because he didnU+2019t do anythingU+2026 Anything other than being Harry freaking Potter, the guy who has the writer in his pocket. God how dreadful; he was just standing in a corner not doing anything and all of a sudden everyone is saying he will compete in the Magic Triathlon as the champion of his school. Only problem is, not only he didnU+2019t sign as a contestant, not only he didnU+2019t want to become one, but also his age was not allowing him to participate in the first place. It was like sending a 12 year old to the OlympicsU+2026 by force!FatalismAnd of course the teachers didnU+2019t mind at all how such a top important law was broken and went along with it. They just believed what a magic cup was telling them to do without even questioning the reasoning. Just like the sorting hat, an object once again determines their lives without giving them the option to decline. How is this not tyrannical? How are they supposed to be a democratic society with its own freelance news reporters and elected ministry when they let arbitrary objects to control their lives? How do characters even have free will? This is once again proving why magic becomes a cheap excuse to initiate conflict before used again for undoing it in an instant, making the whole thing fatalistic and illogical.Cheating is ok if you are the protagonistItU+2019s impossible for a kid to win if he is facing epic lever athletes with decades of more experience than him. Unless of course you are Harry freaking Potter, the guy who wins without doing anything and cheats all the time. Each test is supposed to be a secret until the last momen,t and yet teachers and house elves constantly tip him what to do and give him magic gismos to easily pass each test. See that kids? If you want to win, all you have to do is cheat, like your favorite hero does. How educational!No defensesSecurity is even easier to break now, since more people keep escaping that prison from which nobody is supposed to be able to escape from. You would think they would have doubled the defenses since the last incident, but nah, they just made it easier now.Even if you do something extremely obvious, such as attacking people in the middle of the world cup, the place that is supposed to be super secure so normal people wonU+2019t notice anything, you can have all the fun you like and then just walk away because nobody is going to stop you. By the time the magic police arrives, you will have teleported away. ThatU+2019s right, you can teleport anywhere you want. WhatU+2019s the point of having trains and flying cars and owls delivering messages, when you can just teleport anywhere you like in an instant?As for the all mighty magic police, rest assured that they will never find you, since they will be busy attacking with spells innocent people who were just standing there doing nothing. And now imagine which person they attacked first. Come on, make a wild guess. Yes, it was Harry. He didnU+2019t do anything and yet he gets accused of using black magic only someone with double his age could perform. Yeah, the magic police are geniuses.Magic is panaceaBut worry not, as there is a spell that can fix everything. Eye witnesses? Amnesia spell! Something broke? Mending spell! You donU+2019t have money? Trasmutate something into gold. Just go asking why RonU+2019s family is poor when you can do anything you like with magic.One of the countless things you can do with it, is brainwashing someone to your biding. You know, like telling you the secret passwords to the most secure places in the world? What is the point of security when magic can undo anything in an instant?Or if you are Harry freaking Potter, you donU+2019t even need to do that since you can guess the password to the archmagesU+2019 room in a few seconds, by mentioning random words. Anyone else would need years to crack a code but Harry does it in seconds by accident. Totally not convenient.Another thing you can do with magic is transforming yourself into a different person. Rest assured that nobody is going to find out you are fake, even if they know the person you are impersonating for decades. There is even a spell that stupefies the target for a few minutes, although I donU+2019t see a reason for having to use that, since everybody is already a retard.And yes, they are retards, since they have alarms that point out when someone is using magic to hide something. Remember, they were in the previous book and they never paid attention to them? And what about the time machine? I mean, they were spamming its use in the previous book just to be in more school sessions. ShouldnU+2019t they use it now to prevent the great tragedy that happened in the end of the story for saving lives and preventing the return of the Lord of All Evil? Well, you can now forget them with an amnesia spell, since as if by magic, they no longer exist. If someone asks questions regarding that, throw a stupefy spell and teleport away.Cheap showdownThe final confrontation is once again disappointing, as it has to do with the bad guy spending 50 pages in explaining all his plans to Harry, instead of, I donU+2019t know; killing him right away? And once again we have a plot convenience saving his ass, as dead friends and family return from the dead to save him with some reverse spell bullshit excuse. And the funny part is that when Harry teleports away from there, another bad guy finds him and spends another 50 pages in explaining shit!And despite having to suffer through 100 pages of infodump, this evil master plan still makes no freaking sense. If their plan was for Harry to touch the cup so he can teleport in front of Voltemort, what was the point of helping him join the triathlon and win in every trial? They could have simply used the disguised bad guy to trick Harry into touching the cup at any given moment. Or they could have grabbed him and pushed him on the cup. Or even better, they could have simply teleported him themselves.And not even the second villain is defeated by Harry doing something. Once again he stands idle, as the teachers appear out of nowhere and save his ass. And check this out; they capture the bad guy and interrogate him. What kind of great detective work are they using? Combining hints and solving riddles? Questioning suspects? Using mind games to lure him into revealing things he normally wouldnU+2019t? Nope, they just brainwash him with a spell and he explains everything right away. Why donU+2019t they simply use brainwashing on everybody since the first book and be done with it? Why didnU+2019t they use it in the trials after the war to find all the hidden allies of Voltemort? And donU+2019t give me bullshit excuses about not wanting to bend free will. They just used it on this guy. The worst part is of course that we get yet another 50 pages of monologue!Awful storytellingThis whole book is essentially 500 pages of filler, infodumping, plot convenience, and Harry cheating in everything. Retarded beyond belief. This series is complete trash in terms of storytelling. How many childrenU+2019s critical thought did this woman author ruin with them? The fanboys keep telling me that I should focus on the characters instead of the plot holes, but that is impossible. No matter what happens to the characters can easily be undone with magic. ItU+2019s like you are asking me to feel sorry for a guy who has a toothache, in a setting with dentists. Why would you feel sorry for someone who is simply not treating an easily treatable problem? You will laugh at his stupidity, which is exactly what I did. So donU+2019t you dare say I am nitpicking because I certainly donU+2019t. I treat these books as they treat my intelligence. And that is, very-very badly."},

J.K. Rowling gives you the QUIDDITCH WORLD CUP and the TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT! Those are two of the best parts too.Ron buying a miniature Viktor Krum during the Quidditch World Cup was so cute.I was so happy when Harry was chosen as one of the players in the Triwizard Tournament! But, when Harry started wearing the invisibility cloak to avoid the sneers and judgment of his fellow Hogwarts schoolmates, it just made me sad. I've also realized here that casting a spell is harder than it looks.When Harry opened the golden egg underwater U+2014 that part was fascinatingly beautiful.I am a huge shipper of Cedric Diggory and Harry Potter. HEDRIC!!!As time goes on in the Wizarding World, I noticed the difference between the Weasley twins. Fred is more carefree than George. Yes, they are both rascal pranksters and inventors in their hearts, yet Fred is always the joker, and George is more reserved - not too reserved, just enough to tell them apart.During the Yule Ball, it was mentioned in the book that Hermione's dress was blue. Yet, in the movie it was pink. Either way, she still looks beautiful no matter what color of the clothes she wear.I ship Hermione and Draco so much. DRAMIONE getting strong.I felt sorry for Bartemius \"Barty\" Crouch Jr. He went under so much pain, maybe that's why he did all those things. Still, he did not deserved to be handed over to the Dementors. And also, some people are shipping him and Luna Lovegood. Is that a thing? Kind of strange, but why not?Voldemort is officially back. Yet the Ministry of Magic denies this. It was so frustrating when I read that. In the beginning of the book, I thought that this is all fun and games. But in the end, the story took a dark and grisly twist.Superb read overall."},

It was still a great book however!The book opens with Harry waking up after having a nightmare of a man being killed by Lord Voldemort, and Harry wakes up with his lightning scar hurting, which happens whenever Voldemort is present. Harry leaves the Dursley's and accompanies The Weasleys and Hermione to the QuidditchAfter reading The Goblet of Fire I started to notice that the books were starting to get darker and darker, because I remember this one being slightly darker than the first 3 books. It was still a great book however!The book opens with Harry waking up after having a nightmare of a man being killed by Lord Voldemort, and Harry wakes up with his lightning scar hurting, which happens whenever Voldemort is present. Harry leaves the Dursley's and accompanies The Weasleys and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup, to watch Ireland vs. Bulgaria. After the match is won by Ireland the site is attacked by Death Eaters, the followers of Lord Voldemort, and they release the Dark Mark, Voldemort's symbol that resembles a skull with a serpent coming from it's mouth like a tongue, and everyone panics because the Dark Mark hasn't been seen for 13 years since Voldemort's disappearance .While at Hogwarts, Professor Dumbledore introduces us to Professor Alastor Moody, AKA Mad-Eye Moody, who is replacing Remus Lupin as Defense Against the Dark Arts Teacher, and also announces that Hogwarts is hosting the Twiwizard Tournament, and 2 schools travel to Hogwarts to compete in the tournament, the Durmstrang Institute, and the Beauxbatons Academy. Professor Dumbledore presents the Goblet of Fire, which is the impartial judge where whoever wishes to compete in the Tournament can place their name in the Goblet and if chosen they can't back out. 3 Students are allowed to compete, the champion chosen from Durmstrang is Viktor Krum (who is also the Seeker of the Bulgarian Quidditch Team, and Hermione becomes infatuated with), the Beauxbatons Champion is Fleur Delacour, and the Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, a Hufflepuff student. Even though Harry admits to not entering the tournament, his name is put into the Goblet of Fire, no one knows by who, but everybody believes it was Harry, and the accuse him and call him a cheat because by order of the Ministry of Magic, for their on safety no one under the age of 17 is allowed to compete in the tournament.Harry has no choice since the rule is he can't back out. So Harry and the other champions must face 3 very difficult tasks. What Harry doesn't realize however is that whoever put his name into the Goblet is no friend to him and it involves Lord Voldemort.I remember when I saw the movie in theaters with some friends, at the time I thought it was the scariest one yet, and of course it was the first film to get a PG-13 rating. Some parts just scared the hell out of me, like the fight with the Dragon, and the return of Lord Voldemort. And they also left out a lot of stuff that was in the book, which I hated, it was still good though, and I had the biggest crush on Fleur Delacour when I was a kid, I always dreamed of marrying her, I thought she was so beautiful. I also noticed in this book that Ron and Hermione slowly consider each other more than just friends, even though they still bicker quite a bit, HAHA!In my opinion, probably the second best Harry Potter book, right up there with The Prisoner of Azkaban!"},

Then again, the theme and structure of the books is repetitious, so perhaps there is little else I can add.By this point, Rowling has caught her stride, and begun that inescapable page-climb for which she became--especially in the young-adult genre--especially infamous. This book is, more than anything, an expansion of the world and of events. She puts off Quidditch at the school--perhaps out of a fear that Harry's Gryffindors playing every year would grow dull. Instead, we have the Tri-Wizard Tournament and the World Quidditch Cup (to tide us over). Many critiques of Rowling's world-building--previously grumblings--can begin in earnest here, as she expands the world of wizards from a small cadre into a full-blown, worldwide community of secret-keeping.Not only are there the questions of Why all the secrecy, but now How, as well. The plot leaps around as is its wont, aided by a magical urging here or a convenient villain there, and the promised 'dead character' is, of course, one almost entirely given importance solely in this text. This certainly isn't the most underwhelming that her promise of future deaths will become, but it is a foreshadowing.The characters and conflicts are exciting as ever, and as she finally developed the pacing in the last book to prevent us losing ourself in a plot which twists and turns not so much like a maze, but like a meandering goat trail, we can at least now feel the wind in our hair as we gallop along it.I really wish that the various psychological and foreshadowed elements would resolve themselves, but one often as not finds that the climax comes with a sense of \"oh, are we here already?\" rather than \"I've been waiting for this\".Rowling seems to do better when things are darker and more hopeless (or perhaps those are the only moments when she cannot draw into the waistcoats of her child's lit contemporaries for inspiration), and this book continues the trend that began with a darker change in tone in 'Prisoner of Azkaban' and culminating in the next offering.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"},

Those 10 books may change in the road, at least 2 or 3 of them, but I wanted to have just 10 books in that shelf to denote how special those books are for me for different reasons, and well, to \"burn\" 7 spaces in the Harry Potter books wasn't something that I like to do, so I chose to use the 4th book as a representant of the entire series. And by that, the following review will be about the whole series, and not limited to the 4th book. Don't worry, there aren't spoilers. Well, my reading of Harry Potter books was magical (pun intended) and it was a return to serious active reading duties. I have been reader all my life but for some time (maybe a couple of years) I was like out of the hype of being reading something, much less some book that it was a phenomenon in the readers' world. Usually my novels were horror books by Dean Koontz, Star Trek novels or Buffy the Vampire Slayer novels, so I was like out of what was the rush in current readers' world. I was watching the films but I hadn't read the books. However, a friend lent me the first book after I had watched the 4th film and WOW!!! I couldn't believe how good was the first book! The adaptation to film was very well done here, but the prose and style of JK Rowling was magical (pun intended...again!) and then I knew that I had to read the rest of the books. I started to buy the following books (later I got my own copy of the first one for the collection), when I went to watch the 5th film, I already read the book ;) It was a different experience. Okay, I love the first book and I was way tempted to use that one as the representant in the favorites shelf. I like the second book, it's just that since Hermione is my favorite character, well, there are stuff there that put me out of interest at some point of the book, but still it's a very good book and one of the darkest of the series. The third book is amazing and easily one of the best written in the entire series connecting a LOT of stuff that you even met in previous books. The fourth book is wonderful due the inclusion of the other schools of magic, I felt that the world of Potter just got bigger and the whole competition thing is awesome. The 5th book is some of my most stressful experiences in my life! Not really! I felt really trapped without an exit in that book! But it's a proof of how good JK Rowling writes, since anyone who can provoke that kind of feelings while you're reading a book is mag...mmh...oh what the heck! It's magical! ;) Hehehe Also, in the 5th book I got two other wonderful new characters as Luna and Tonks. My only critique to Rowling is about those two characters that both started so amazing that I think that at some point Rowling was worried that some of those two or both could get more popular with fans than Hermione, so you feel in the 6th and 7th books that their roles and time on scenes are at minimum. Since I was so stressed after reading the 5th book, I embrace the 6th book with a lot of happiness and finally I was glad to see how cool the life can be for Harry finally, at least for a time, and knowing the origin of you-know-who was awesome, it's a great tragedy. I ran to the library the day that the 7th book was out and I read it like in 3 days, totally disconnected from internet or news to avoid to be spoiled of anything in the final book and to be honest, it's my least favorite book of the series. I don't know if was because to read it so quick or because I didn't like much of the events there. There are like 3 chapters that I liked a lot in the 7th book, but honestly it was dissapointing to be reading like for a month a lot of podcasts of Rowling explaining a lot of stuff that she forgot to resolve in the book. I think that using a test reading group to check what things she was missing to explain and to resolve could be valuable. It was the final book! Oh, well, I love the books. Rowling rules! Something wicked this way comes when I started to read this magical series! ;)"},

To give you an idea of how grasping the ending was, note that I went to sleep at 3:40 in the morning, face buried in this book. The plot was never dull. The tournament itself had more action and depth than a lot of books, throwing in dragons, merpeople, and a giant maze! This book introduced a character Alastor `\"Mad-Eye\" Moody, who is one of the best characters ever written in the Harry Potter series. He is smart as well as fierce, (view spoiler)[ which is why I was extremely upset when it was revealed that he had not been Ma-Eye all along. (hide spoiler)] The way Rowling described all the new characters was amazing, giving me enough information to paint vivid pictures within my mind of the characters. This book left me laughing yet-- NOT DONE YET. Lets talk about the ending, obviously, spoilers (view spoiler)[. The ending at the graveyard just ripped out my heart and threw it into a meat grinder. Cedric's death was so sad. His life was just thrown away \"kill the extra\" as if he wasn't a living, breathing person.

He was the only person who could convince the council that Voldemort has returned.

This book is the turning point where the series changes, with its first death and with Voldemort being back. This book has a darker tone and shows the maturing of the novels and characters. I feel the title of this book should have been Harry Potter and the Triwizard Tournament as the Goblet of Fire plays a very small in this book. Also Avada Kadavra does not seem the worse way to die, at least it is quick. The film missed out lots of stuff from this book such as SPEW, the twins and Bagman, Hagrid being a half giant and so much more. The hormones have kicked in and you can see the main characters growing up and becoming the adults they later become. Poor Harry, he can never catch a break and is under loads of attention and pressure in this book. Ron, even though he is one of my favourite, did irritate me as he did not stick by his best friend, but this happens often with teenagers and I can understand him always being over looked and second best. I like how we get to know Neville more and about his past. This entire series is very British apart from the Yule Ball which is very American as at most school dances I went to, we donU+2019t partner up but just go as group of friends unless they are already a couple. There are a few plot holes which donU+2019t make sense, firstly the rules said that only 3 people were allowed in the tournament so why did they not stop Harry continuing. Also I donU+2019t get how the people that meant the most to Cedric and Krum are girls that they have only been going out with for a few weeks. The biggest plot hole in this book is how Voldemort got his wand back as he was a kind of spirit when he fled from attacking infant Harry.I cannot recommend Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and the entire series highly enough.

This isn't the copy I originally bought back in 2000 (it was first released in paperback; book 5 was the first hardcover edition on release); I had to put that one in the recycling bin and buy a new copy (and I was shocked at how expensive it was: at $32, it's much more than the other children's/YA hardcovers) because it had water damage and black mould on the bottom from the time when my brother stored some boxes of my books under his house - on dirt, on a steep hillside - while I was in Japan. Idiotic thing to do. I also lost my original copy of Philosopher's Stone too, which is why I have the Raincoast (Canadian) edition of it now.The Goblet of Fire starts, as usual, at the end of the summer holidays before Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts. Because Harry now has a godfather - escaped mass murderer Sirius Black - the Dursleys are being, not nice, but careful not to overtly abuse Harry less this mad protector hears about it. So when Harry is invited to the final match in the Quidditch World Cup by his best friend, Ron Weasley, Uncle Vernon reluctantly agrees.The World Cup final is between Ireland and Bulgaria, and the Weasleys have seats in the top box. After the game, several Death Eaters - supporters of Lord Voldemort - make an appearance, as does the Dark Mark in the sky. It's just the beginning of the signs that Voldemort is on his way back, and when Harry's name comes out of the Goblet of Fire, making him a fourth school Champion in the Triwizard Tournament, it's clear that something foul is afoot.I tend to think of this book as the end of Harry's childhood, because things get extra serious, Cedric Diggory is murdered, and Lord Voldemort returns. The next three books are noticeably darker in tone and deed, and unlike in   Chamber of Secrets, people - Harry's friends - start dying. I always felt more tense, here on out (in a good way).The ending of this book always makes me cry. Cedric's death is one of those horrible, senseless deaths. Rowling makes sure you're going to have a personal stake in Harry's drive to defeat Voldemort, after Cedric's death, for Cedric was a genuinely good, likeable boy. Dumbledore's memorial speech at the end is incredibly moving - truly, Dumbledore gets some of the best lines, and is a phenomenal character and role model. To be honest, this series is as good for children learning about right and wrong etc., as the fairy tales used to be. (Fairy tales are cautionary tales using analogies to impart warnings etc.) If children learn morals from books, this series has lots to impart.Goblet of Fire is a busy book, with a great deal happening over the course of a school year. We also learn more about Snape, though we've barely scratched the surface with this complex character. I love Snape as a perfect example of someone who seems bad but fights for \"good\" - not black and white, in other words. The introduction of two other wizarding schools - Beauxbattons and Durmstrang - as well as learning about Hagrid's giantess mother, also introduced issues of race and prejudice (further from the Muggle and Mudblood prejudices) into the story, as well as some fun new characters. We not only get this wider scope of the wizarding world in terms of learning about other schools, we also get a more political novel - ministry officials not only make an appearance but have important roles in the plot, their \"adult\" politics filter into Harry's world and awareness: that awareness that adult decisions have huge impact on a child's world, their life, and that adults don't always make the right decision or know everything; that it's more than okay to question an adult. Because, just because adults are adult, doesn't make them irreproachable, or wise, or unquestionable. And when kids realise that, they've taken the first step into the adult world of disabused notions, unfairness, hypocrisy and ulterior motives.And Hermione's determination to make the school's house-elves see that they're slave labour and insist on fair wages and freedom, raises questions not only about workers' rights but also misguided assumptions and placing your own views and beliefs on others just because you're sure you're right, regardless of other \"people's\" culture and belief system. (Yes they are technically slave labour, but it was more interesting reading it as an analogy for colonialism and/or religious preaching/missionary work in \"uncivilised\" parts.)The events in this book make it one of the more exciting ones, as well as its climactic ending, but there's still some very nice character development going on. Ron's insecurities, as coming from a large family that overshadows him, comes out again and you have to feel for him, his reaction is understandable (as someone who comes from a family of five kids, all of whom are much louder than me, I know the feeling!).One of the things I noticed this time 'round, knowing who the enemy at Hogwarts is (who put Harry's name in the Goblet), was how much Harry learnt off Moody, who, yes, was making sure Harry won the Tournament, but in doing so taught him much, gave him the tools or motivated Harry to get them for himself (all the hexes and jinks he learns, for instance), to battle Voldemort and defend himself. It's quite ironic really. I always felt equally betrayed by Moody/Barty Couch, because I liked him so much as Harry's teacher and mentor! The real Moody I feel you never really get to know, in comparison.It's funny, I've only seen the movie once too but I was surprised, when reading the book, that it's Dobby who gives Harry the gillyweed and solves that problem for him - Moody plants the information with Neville but Harry never asks around for help. In the movie, Neville does help him in this task, and I loved that. I love it when Neville gets appreciated, he's one of my favourite minor characters and more important than you ever realise. The movie did a good job in changing that around, it worked well for the screen. But I had completely forgotten that it's Dobby who helps Harry, in the book!Overall, the story becomes more complex and more gripping, with this fourth instalment. Things are chugging along at a fine pace, the stakes are higher than ever, Voldemort is a real threat now and the wizarding world continues to be developed and added to so that it's hard (or simply more fun) to remember that it's not real. Now I'm off to watch the movie again! :)"},

Harry is in the midst of adolescence, so you'll notice a correlated development, character-wise, of him, Ron, and Hermione. The storyline gets juicier, darker, and far less tweenie. There is room for giggles on many occasions (and a few tears if you're extra sensitive). This book worked its charm and casted a spell on me that attached my hands to it. There were times when I couldn't put it down! What can I say more? Pick it up if you haven't done so yet. You won't regret it no matter how old you are.__________  All my HP reviews:1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.3) Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.4) Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.5) Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.6) Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.7) Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.__________Sirius Black has some golden words to say:__________J.K.

AsU+00ED que ha sido estupendo porque he podido disfrutar el libro como si fuera virgen con nociones. En este caso, me quedo con el libro de calle. Hemos pasado de 350 a 650 pU+00E1ginas y se nota en la profundidad de los personajes, a aU+00F1os luz del metraje de 2 horas y media en la que se sugiere todo y faltan innumerables detalles. En cada tomo me reafirmo en la idea de que Rowling debiU+00F3 de pensar en esta serie como \"Los tres aprendices de magos\", pero en cuestiU+00F3n de mercadotecnia era mucho mU+00E1s sabio dejarlo en \"Harry Potter\". Y es que en las pelU+00EDculas se acusa aU+00FAn mU+00E1s la sensaciU+00F3n de que Harry es un repipiolo al que se lo tienen que dar todo hecho y que su U+00FAnica habilidad es haber nacido con estrella (o en este caso rayo). Pero es porque en el cine no hay forma de adentrarse de igual manera en su personaje y ver los hilos invisibles de la amistad que lo une no solo a sus amigos mU+00E1s U+00EDntimos, sino al entramado de personajes interesantes y carismU+00E1ticos. Harry tiene mucho de esa \"potra infinita\", pero no podrU+00EDa ser de otra manera ya que, en caso contrario, serU+00EDa un personaje \"puto amo\" con el que no se puede congeniar. Harry es un chico medio normal envuelto en una historia muy jodida y esa es su fortaleza. Y no me refiero al quidditch, me refiero a que no es un poderoso mago (aU+00FAn) que pueda enfrentarse con seguridad a mil peligros, sino un chaval con mU+00E1s agallas que un grindylow y unos vU+00EDnculos de amor mU+00E1s fuertes que la madre de Hagrid. Pero, en realidad, la que parte el bacalao es Hermione. Se mantiene en segundo plano pero es, para mU+00ED, la mejor. El cerebro en la sombra, jaja. En resumen: lo he disfrutado mucho. Incluso las situaciones de celos, amor o relaciones entre personajes que por lo general me aburren, han sido de lo mU+00E1s entretenidas y bien ejecutadas. A veces se me hacU+00EDa mU+00E1s lento porque hay mU+00E1s separaciU+00F3n entre puntos fuertes del libro, pero esa sensaciU+00F3n desaparece a las pocas pU+00E1ginas al llegar al premio. Todo era necesario para hacer de este libro una maravilla. Edito: Me hubiese gustado ponerle 4,5 pero hay que elegir. Y para destacar los que mU+00E1s me van gustando de la serie... pues redondeo para arriba :) Porque amigos, it was amazing."},

It's kind of spoilery for the order of the phoenix and the end of the book so... In the last chapter, they are leaving hogwarts and the horseless carriages are mentioned... but by then Harry is supposedly able to see the testrals already, since the whole Cedric thing. Maybe she (the author) added the Testrals and who can see them and who can't in the order of the phoenix just to add to Harry frustration and kind of enphasize the situation even more...nothing to take away from the continuity of the story, because in the rereads you are going to find all the clues j.k. rowling left for what was about to happen.. in fact my status update at 89% was:>\"You have been taugh how to duel. Harry Potter\" [...]At these words Harry remembered [...] the dueling club at hogwarts [...]... All he had learned there was the disarming spell, EXPELLIARMUS, and what use would it be [...]?ARE WE SERIOUSLY GOING THERE J.K. ROWLING?

This is my 4th reread of the series but thereU+2019s always some kind of new detail I notice every timeU+2026....**If you have not read this book yet there are spoilers below.**(1) No punishment from the Ministry of Magic for Harry: Oh how this discrepancy bothers me so much! And this won't be the first time that Harry won't receive disciplinary action from the Ministry -- this issue will come up again in Half-Blood Prince. ANYWAY. Mr. Weasley majorly bends the rules and gets the Dursley's fireplace connected to the Floo Network so the Weasley's can pick Harry up two weeks before the term starts -- roadtrip to the Quidditch World Cup! However, Mr. Weasley doesn't know that previously, in Sorcerer's Stone, Mr. Dursley boarded up the fireplace. So when the Mr. Weasley, the twins, and Ron show up, they can't simply step out of the fireplace. What are they to do? No worries, it's nothing that Mr. Weasley and his wand can't fix! He just blasts all the wood out of the way! (Magic!)Then one of the twins drops a Ton-Tongue Toffee which Dudley scoops up and eats -- Dudley's tongue swells up and becomes many feet long. ACK! No worries, it's nothing that Mr. Weasley and his wand can't fix! (Magic again!)I HEART the Harry Potter stories so much but it REALLY bothers me Rowling is not following her own rules that she established during her earlier world-building. I certainly don't want Harry suspended or expelled from Hogwarts, but Harry most certainly SHOULD HAVE received some kind of official warning (or punishment) from the Ministry of Magic. It's already been established (Chamber of Secrets) that it doesn't matter that Harry didn't do the magic himself. What matters is that magic was done in Harry's home (a Muggle home) and magic isn't supposed to be done outside of school.For some background info: Harry got the first official warning from the Ministry when Dobby (the Malfoy's now former house-elf) used magic to drop the pudding on top of the Dursley's guest (Chamber of Secrets). However, Harry did not get a second warning in Prisoner of Azkaban when, in anger, he \"inflated\" Aunt Marge and then ran away, and later boarded the Knight Bus. I'm TOTALLY OKAY with Harry NOT getting that second warning (or punishment) from the Ministry of Magic because Minister Cornelius Fudge meets up with Harry at the Leaky Cauldron and explains things a bit (and why Harry won't be getting punished).But the lack of a warning from the Ministry of Magic to Harry for this \"magical\" incident involving the Weasley's does indeed bother me.(Plus, goodness, with all that blasting and Aunt Petunia screaming, it's a wonder how much of all that racket the Dursley's neighbors overheard and how they are going to explain those noises away. They crave normalcy and certainly do not want their neighbors to know there is any magic hanky-panky going on under their roof.)(2) Camping Muggle style: Okay, so the camping tent has a kitchen AND bathroom inside yet Mr. Weasley asks Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go fetch some water. Um, okay. I guess by fetching water the trio were able to WALK through the campsite and SEE stuff and HEAR stuff and INTERACT with people -- but really, I think it would have just been better for them to just go walk around and explore, the pretense of needing water seems a bit silly.And does it really take one hour for a campfire to get hot enough to brew up some tea and cook some sausages?(3) Muggle attire: I am a bit baffled that some witches and wizards simply cannot dress like a proper Muggle and put the oddest garments together to make an outfit. I think Rowling does this more to just show the HUGE segregation (or cultural gap) between the Wizarding World and the Muggle World. But, still, you'd think that witches and wizards wear something under their robes besides undergarments (do they?!?!) and would maybe be able to throw some kind of competent look/outfit together.(4) A very wet Welcome Back Feast: The Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione get rained on on the way to the King's Cross Station. Then the students get rained on again when they arrive at Hogwarts. And to top it off, Peeves was throwing water balloons at students in the Great Hall. So it goes without saying that the students are very, very wet for the Sorting Ceremony (either as participants or observers) and for the Welcome Back Feast.Why didn't Professor McGonagall (or anyone else) perform the \"hot-air\" charm on the students? Both Hermione (Order of the Phoenix) and Dumbledore (Half-Blood Prince) preform this charm. But even without knowing this \"hot-air\" spell exists, it makes sense to think that such a spell would exist and wonder why the students didn't get \"dried-off\" before the feast begins. Although the students seemingly don't complain about being wet or miserable, and no one mentions catching a cold, it does seems likely that all that dampness would put a damper on the enjoyment of the festivities. Although, Dennis, Collin Creevy's brother, certainly was having a blast despite falling into the lake!(5) The Weighing of the Wands: Is it just me, or shouldn't this \"ceremony\" have been a bit more serious? It's very cool that Mr. Ollivander, the wand maker, examined the wands and described them. But the one spell he did with each of the four champions' wands seemed a bit silly. Shouldn't he have been more concerned to make sure the wands were in tip top shape and functioning properly? That the wands weren't tampered with -- as in somehow given \"extra powers\" that the wand shouldn't have? (Note: I don't know if it's possible to \"give\" a wand \"extra power\" but it's something to think about...)(6) Professor Trelawney's Divination Class: It's obvious that Harry and Ron don't have much respect for Professor Trelawney -- they joke between themselves in class, don't take the assignments seriously, and, even occasionally, get cheeky with her. Like with Hermione, I'm surprised Trelawney hasn't handed out detentions to Harry and Ron. But I'm also curious as to why both continue to take Trelawney's class when they don't like it -- they do have other course options. (I know they both stay enrolled because Trelawney is needed for some of the plot points/twists.)(7) Finding Hogwarts: If Hogwarts is supposed to be unplottable on maps, secretly hidden, etc..... then how did Headmistress Madame Olympe Maxime and her students from Beauxbatons as well as Headmaster Igor Karkaroff and his students from Durmstrang find Hogwarts? (And the champions' families who get to come watch the Third Event?)(8) Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students: Maxime and Karkaroff bring only a select group of students (possibly a dozen each) from their respective schools for the opportunity to have the Goblet of Fire select one of them to be their school champion at the TriWizard Tournament.But what do these \"foreign\" students do while at Hogwarts? I've gotten the impression that the Beaxbatons and Durmstrang students remain at Hogwarts for the entire duration of the TriWizard Tournament -- there is no mention of them leaving and coming back between events. I am basing my assumption that the students, Maxime, and Karkaroff hang around on three incidents:Incident #1: Between the announcement of the Tournament and the announcement of the Yule Ball, Harry, Ron, and Hermione frequently see Victor Krum in the library. We later learn that Krum had been skulking around in the hopes of getting Hermione by herself so he could ask her to the Yule Ball.Incident #2: Padma Patil (Harry's date from the Yule Ball) mentions that one of the boys from Beauxbaton is meeting her during the next Hogsmeade visit. (As a side note, Hogwarts must be in close proximity to Hogsmeade since the students all walk there.)Incident #3: Karkaroff interupts the Gryffindor-Slytherin Potions Class to talk to Snape.So if Maxime's and Karkaroff's students are sticking around, what do they do while the Hogwarts students are in class? There is no mention of these students \"sitting in on\" classes with the Hogwarts students. How are these students continuing their magical education?And getting back to the TriWizard Tournament, for the third event, the families of the champions get to come visit and watch the last event. Prior to this, there is no mention of any other special guests watching the first and second event. The TriWizard Tournament seems like a pretty big deal, so it's a bummer that it seems that only the students and staff from the school hosting the Tournament are able to watch it -- bummer for the students (and staff) from the other two schools who are seemingly missing out. How odd they can't be there in person to root on their own school champion.(As a side note, there is mention of Beauxbaton students (specifically boys) that attended the Yule Ball. It is not known if these students made up part of the small group that Maxime selected herself to bring to the Goblet of Fire ceremony or if they were students that were \"left behind\" but came to visit.)(9) The Dark Mark Tattoo: For those of us who have already read this book, we know earlier on that Karkaroff is alluding to the Dark Mark Tattoo on his arm when he is talking to Snape. We can assume Snape has one too (at one point in Goblet of Fire Snape grabs his own forearm in response to something that Moody says and later we know for sure when Snape shows his mark to the Minister of Magic, Fudge.) Yet Sirius says (page 530) that \"...Snape was never even accused of being a Death Eater...\" and that Snape is \"...clever and cunning enough to keep himself out of trouble.\"But now knowing that these \"I-Support-The-Dark-Lord\" tattoos exist, it seems like it would be easy for the Ministry of Magic to find Death Eaters -- they'd just need to check someone's forearm. However, Karkaroff mentions the mark is getting darker, so at one point it seems the tatttoos had faded -- maybe the marks vanished completely after Voldemort lost his powers when he attempted to kill Harry as a baby? Then maybe each Death Eaters forearm would look like it was never tattooed at all? If so, then that certainly would make it difficult for the Ministry of Magic to identify Death Eaters.(10) The Pensieve: I've always wondered if someone could get \"stuck\" or \"trapped\" in the Pensieve (or in the memory itself) as an observer. That would be beyond surreal and bizarre. This won't be the first time that Harry just dives into a Pensieve uninvited -- Harry will do this later with Snape's Pensieve in Half-Blood Prince -- and then is later retrieved. Before Harry \"dove\" into the Pensieve he was able to see into the memory realm below -- so it is highly likely that Dumbledore (and Snape) could look into their own Pensieve and see Harry in the memory. BUT..... What if the Pensieve owner chooses not to retrieve Harry? Would Harry have been stuck or trapped in that memory or does the Pensieve have some kind of built-in mechanism that spits a person(s) back out when the memory has finished \"playing\"?(11) Mrs. Figg: Dumbledore tasks Sirius with spreading the news about Voldemort's return to Remus Lupin, Arabella Figg, and Mundungus Fletcher. The surname Figg sounds familiar because Mrs. Figg (in Order of the Phoenix we learn she's a Squib) is one of the Dursley's neighbors and she has \"babysat\" Harry before in her home. Perhaps due to Harry current exhausted and emotional state, Harry's ears didn't perk-up at the sound of Mrs. Figg's name -- plus there's a chance that he didn't even know that Arabella was her first name and/or there's the chance that Figg could be a common surname in the Wizarding World.(12) The horseless carriages: Since Sorcerer's Stone, the horseless carriages have been transporting Hogwarts students to and from Hogsmeade Station. We learn in Order of the Phoenix that the horseless carriages aren't really horseless -- they are driven by Thestrals. Thestrals are magical creatures that can only be seen by those who have witnessed a death. It's a bit odd that Harry doesn't see them at the end of Goblet of Fire since he was present when Cedric Diggory died. And let's not forget, Harry's mother died protecting him, although I'm not sure if Harry actually witnessed that.Even though (1) and (8) are more like pet-peeves than analysis, Goblet of Fire is still a major wow of a story. It's just so amazing. So many sub-plots. More back-story. It's just brilliant. And even though I already knew about one of the major plot twists -- this is a re-read afterall -- it's still such an engrossing, turn-paging read. I still get caught up in everything. Onto book five, Order of the Phoenix!Goblet of Fire was re-read from August 5, 2015 - Augst 19, 2015(posted 8-19-2015, minor edits made 8-20-2015)all my reviews can be found at www.isniffbooks.wordpress.com"},

I have attempted to make ButterBeer (and succeeded). I have done a spot of wishful thinking and hoped that Hogwarts has misplaced my letter (well, not really...but yes). And yes.............I have stuck with Harry till the very end.So obviously, with the end in sight, I HAD to reread the series. And when I reached   Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire, I realized that alas....alackk....and also, erlack....I had not written a review on it. *  shock* *  horror* *  convincing Victorian swoon*. Soon I recovered from the fiendish blow and penned down a wholly biased review. Here goes:-------------------------------------The Quidditch World Cup followed by The Triwizard Tournament form the backdrop for the fourth instalment. As The Quidditch Finals culminate in the sudden appearance of the DARK MARK, a wave of panic spreads through the Wizarding world. The Dark Mark is the sign of   U+2018He-Who-Must-Not-Be-NamedU+2019; a mark that heralds the return of pure, undiluted evil. Our wee Potter isnU+2019t feeling too uppity either. The scar on his forehead has been ailing him; another indication that olU+2019Voldy is either very near of is feeling particularly murderous. Sirius (in hiding) is worried and sends comforting owl mails at regular intervals. Hermione is worried and races to the library at regular intervals. Ron is worried and turns an unbecoming shade of red at regular intervals.So when Harry is chosen by the magical Goblet of Fire as one of the contenders for The Triwizard Tournament, itU+2019s only natural that everyone starts having kittens; left, right and center. The tournament which claims to be an attempt to improve relationships in the Wizarding Community is no game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey. Past history reveals that the tasks are dangerous and injurious to health in every sense of the word.Soon, Harry is battling dragons, merpeople, unexpected jinxes, hexes and the odd Blast-Ended Skrewt. But itU+2019s the end that decides it all. In a startling twist, Harry will soon face a task that will make The Hungarian Horntail Dragon seem like a mild-mannered lapdog. -------------------------------------  Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire can adequately be summed up in one word : DRAMATIC.Whether itU+2019s the sporting fervour whipped up at The Quidditch World Cup or the wave of excitement and danger that holds together at The Triwizard Tournament, J.K.Rowling is the Mother Monster of Event-Managers. A host of enticing new characters make their entry : Cedric Diggory, Mad-Eye Moody, Barty Crouch (Sr. & Jr.), Ludo Bagman, Madame Maxime, Viktor Krum, Karkaroff, Rita Skeeter and.....The Dark Lord himself. Despite being a fairly heavy book, the pace never wanes. One endearing quality of RowlingU+2019s writing is that no fact or seemingly odd bit of trivia is ever merely that. Somewhere, somehow, she will dip into her own personal Pensieve, extract the minuscule detail and entwine it with the plot. So while reading her books, remember to be in a state of (as Mad-Eye Moody would term it) U+201CCONSTANT VIGILANCEU+201D.The fledgling romances serve as endearing sub plots: Harry and Cho, Ron and Hermione and Krum and ofcourse, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Snape continues his reign of unabated nastiness. Malfoy is his usual charming self. Cedric (the future Mr.Edward Cullen) is a wholly likeable character who stays with you till the end. Dumbledore is pitching his perfect performance as usual : whether itU+2019s turning a blind eye to the never ending pranks, or giving a fair listening to an improbable tale or doling out wisdom in his unique way or standing tall, eyes ablaze in the face of dark times.Tight storyline, shocking twists and throat-clogging moments. In all, a magnificent read. "},

Welcome to another rambling review!The first major thing that I really want to hash out is how I conceptualize the books. It's a bit odd, I will admit. I see the first three books, Sorcerer's Stone through Prisoner of Azkaban, as their own trilogy. I mean, it's not that hard to see. All of them are very light and while they deal with heavy themes -- death, loyalty and betrayal, etc -- they don't delve deep into them. Because, Harry's a child and, more importantly, he hasn't gone through any specific trauma that has completely scarred him. He can't remember his parents dying and he recovers well after each adventure.Then, the last three books -- Order of the Phoenix through Deathly Hallows -- are also a trilogy to me. They deal with the darker themes, exploring them. Death and grief, losing someone, persecution, PTSD, etc. Those books explore the themes that were set up very well in the first three books, just not as in depth.So, for me, this book is a stand alone, almost. Yes, it's connected to the whole series. Of course it is. Yet... it isn't. It's not a part of the first three and it's not a part of the last three. It serves as a bridge, tying in things from the first trilogy and bringing it to a place where we can start exploring the darker themes together. That's how I've seen this book for ages, and I couldn't put my finger on why until a couple years ago.Now, this book was my favorite for a long time. Half-Blood Prince has replaced it, so this has to be my second favorite in the series. Five and seven tie for third, then the last three are lumped together for fourth place. (I love them, and they never fail to make me smile when I need a pick me up, but all of my favorite books deal with really heavy themes in depth.)Also, this was the last book in this series -- and in general, come to think of it -- that my mom read to me. Since I was four when this book came out, I wasn't reading it on my own. Sorry guys, but I was not a prodigy. The only memory I have of reading this book is this:Basically, I had an alarm clock in my room. I had been waking up on my own (like a big kid!) since I was in first grade, but my mom would come in my room and she would read a chapter or so of a book to me while I was waking up. I know, I had the best mom ever. Anyways, she must have read the chapter when Harry was with the Death Eaters. I must have been in third grade, or a couple years before the movie came out. So, she read that chapter to me, I bounded aboard the bus after eating breakfast, sat with my little friends, and told them the story of what Harry got up to that day.Let's not forget that I would play Harry Potter until I was in fourth or fifth grade in recess.#noregretsAlso, since I'm reading this series specifically this time to catch all the little instances that Dumbledore says or does something since I headcanon that he knows all along basically everything that goes down, and that everything he allows happen is a test to see if Harry's ready, I'll add this. Each book I read, the more and more sickened I get with Dumbledore. He's basically a parallel to Voldemort, I gather that much. Just like Snape and Voldemort show Harry what he could have become -- see the Three Brothers story in Deathly Hallows or Tale of the Beedle Bard -- Voldemort and Dumbledore are practically the same.I think my favorite* instance of that was when Dumbledore found out that Voldemort had used Lily's protection to his own advantage:For a fleeting instant, Harry thought he saw a gleam of something like triumph in Dumbledore's eyes.That's just.... sickening. Absolutely sickening. Dumbledore gets excited about Voldemort upping the game. Just like how Dumbledore felt about Grindelwald. The more I read, the more disillusioned I become with Dumbledore. The more I see him for who he truly is.*Favorite = most sickening"},

The stakes have risen dramatically. Lord Voldemort is on his rise back to power, and it's no child's play. Darkness gathers around Harry, innocently starting at The Quidditch World Cup and gathering deeper and deeper, in the form of unexpected news at Hogwarts school about a tournament that hasn't been staged for many many years, where Harry, unwillingly, will be playing a major role, which will eventually lead him to face his ultimate enemy yet again.

There are lots of funny bits, and the charactersU+2014 outside of Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who continue to be predictable cardboard bad guysU+2014do manage to come alive on the page, despite a preponderance of cliches. The adults in charge continue to be just stupid enough, as usual, to put Harry in mortal danger, and Harry is unswervingly good and true, the Prince in Waiting who is training for the Great War. Somebody good does die, as rumor had it; Rowling hits the reader suddenly, but then makes it just bearable with ghostly reappearances in a key point.The entire houseelf sequence, I suspect, if written by an American, would net the author a major slamdunk for the Uncle Tom attitudes not just in the elves' insistence that they really like not just serving, but being subservient. SoU+2026they 'like' bowing, scraping, running about in fear of offending their masters (and that word is used all the time), their fractured English peppered with honorifics, and their inability to dress properly? It's only Hermione, she who's of 'mixed blood' who insists on their consciousness being raised, but she's held up in ridicule, because subservience is in their natures. As one of the characters says of Mr. Crouch and his house-elf Winky, \"You can judge a man by not how he treats his peers, but by how he treats his inferiors.\" Inferiors.

After turning the last page and felt REALLY cheated, I never go back to read any other HP book.PSS: I read in somewhere that one of the appeals of Harry Potter series is that Harry as a character satisfies a common childhood fantasy about an orphaned/abused child getting away from the bad family (Harry's aunt and uncle) and goes into a world when he has a perfect family (Harry's real parents, they're perfect because they're dead), and everyone in this new world thinks he's important.Who hadn't imagined our parents aren't our real parents and we had a perfect family somewhere else, back when we were kids and our parents were giving us grief? And who hadn't imagined there's a secret world somewhere, where our importance and significance would be acknowledged and recognized, when as in reality we aren't so very special? Harry Potter plays into this child fantasy perfectly. But sadly when I read it, I was already too old to take this fantasy seriously.

Book 4 left me needing a resolution, not necessarily because of the cliff hanger, although that helped, but because of the evil that tainted the final chapters. I was not expecting such a prevalence of evil in a children's book. I needed to know that evil had not overtaken the world and I realized I was caught up into the fantasy land Rowling created. I thought the Quidditch match at the beginning was a little long and the last-minute discovery of gillyweed a little far-fetched, but overall there is way more to like than dislike: the challenges, particularly the last, the dark arts lessons (especially the forbidden curses), the confusion with the map, and of course the ball with the beginnings of a romance blossoming between Ron and Hermionine, so teenage boy and girl. I loved Mad-Eye Moody: the paranoia, the double entendres (not sexual), and the scene where Crouch senior dies in the forest. Fabulous. The inevitable turning point in the series certainly sparked intensity into the story. This is the book that turns the series from a fun adventure with a predictable saves the day outcome, to the beginnings of a true battle between good and evil when the bad don't give up so easily. It's not child's play anymore. This is where the fan obsession begins where one can move from thinking they liked Harry Potter alright to feeling invested in the characters and the story. You can't understand how adults can claim Harry Potter as their favorite series until you have at least read book 4--and I say that knowing once you read 4, the cliff hangers only get better and you'll invest in the rest of the story."},

The scope this time widens to include other wizarding schools and events. We are not just in our little bubble anymore. Rowling adds quite a lot to our much loved world and the danger of course becomes much more palpable.Apart from the fantasy elements and school setting, these books are really mysteries at heart, and this fourth instalment doesn't disappoint. Who put Harry's name in the cup? Is someone really after him, and who might it be? Is Voldemort coming back? What are the three tests and will Harry survive them? The reader is invited to follow our main heroes, gather the various tidbits of facts and try to find an explanation before coming to harm. Your typical crime novel.Our characters shine as always. Particular mention should go to Hermione however. She is not just a sidekick but a fully fledged character with her own interests and feelings. We see her juggling her friendship with Harry and Ron as well as her belief in fairness and justice. It is comical to see her battling preconceived ideas with S.P.E.W., and yet, deep down we know that she is right and that the circumstances at Hogwarts are not the same as in the rest of the magical world. This universe, albeit wonderful and amazing, is not devoid of ugliness and prejudices, which are already visible here and there. And now I really want to get to the next book... (although I know what happens - it IS a drug!)PS: Stephen Fry excelling once more ;O)"},

It was a bit of a pain to read this book as it's extremely long and I have seen the movie adaption only about two weeks ago, so the plot was still very vivid on my mind. And when you know all of the plot to an almost 800 page book, well, you'd basically expect your reading experience to be a bit tiresome. Especially since, and I'm sorry for claiming so, the prose is plain, and I'd even go as far as saying crude. I'm sorry, but conversations written in such a basic fashion as   \"...\", said Harry.\"...\", Hermione said. really hurt my poor eyes. I am not one to prefer prose over plot, but I do prefer a coloured writing. Anyhow, prose aside, J.K. Rowling really stepped up her game. With the Goblet of Fire, the Harry Potter series has evolved in something dark and mature, and no longer is something that reads like a series of childrens book. Eventually, I liked this book a lot. Not only did the Dark Lord rise at long last - which changes everything and makes it ten times more interesting - no, I finally got what I was longing for: lots and lots of interhuman relationships, intrigues and drama. And Dobby. There can never be such a thing as enough Dobby for me, so I was delighted to read a lot about him and, ofcourse, the other house elf, Winky. We've also been introduced to Bill Weasly - my favourite Weasly - much earlier than in the movies, so this is another huge plus. All in all, I'm excited for the next book. "},

Moreover, there are chapters which are really long and I think it could have been shorter because there were repetitions about what had happened in the last novels. However, I enjoyed my reading. Especially because Lord Voldemort had risen again and I know the story really begins now. This book reminds me also of Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory and I remember that I really loved it when I was young :pI also liked the description of the Triwizard tasks, even if there were too many spiders for me (eww!). But I have to say that it was almost a minor part of the book even if it was supposed to be the main subject and I think this is sad not having developed it a little bit more.To finish, I still love the relationship between Harry and his friends (Ron, Hermione and Hagrid), but also with Sirius and Dumbledore. There is something strong between them that I deeply appreciate."},

This additon to the series also displays how truly evil the Lord Voldemort character is in a way the other books had not done, which made it a more adult read. The downside of the Goblet of Fire is the unnecessary length of the book. Rowling takes much too long getting the story rolling. The first seven chapters could have been condensed into two or three, and the Quidditch World Cup seems to never end. However, the tasks in the Triwizard Tournament are fun, and once again, the twists at the end, as with the other Potter books, make it a worthwhile read. I recommend it. Just be ready for it to take a couple hundred pages to get interesting and for the character of Ron to be annoying and irritating on a whole other level throughout the book."},

I've heard great things about the audiobooks and I can't believe I've never picked one up before this. I've heard some people complain that Jim Dale reads too slowly, but I typically listen to audiobooks on 1.5-2x speed anyway, so it wasn't an issue for me. Audiobooks are always more enjoyable when the narrator does voices for all the characters, and this was especially entertaining because there are so many different characters in Harry Potter. My only complaint is that the way he pronounced Voldemort (he doesn't pronounce the T at the end) drove me crazy. I got used to it eventually and in 2x speed it isn't as noticeable, but it took me awhile to get used to. "},
