'The other aspect that I liked was how difficult the author made every part of the investigation Harry Ron and Hermione were running in order to find out the truth about the heir of Slytherin ',plot
'The fact that they had to work for months on the Polyjuice potion only enriched the story made it more real in most books about witches they just flick their wands and everything happensIve been trying to think about the negative aspects anything that I dont like about The Chamber of Secrets ',neither
