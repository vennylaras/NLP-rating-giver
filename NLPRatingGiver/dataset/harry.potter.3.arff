"So many little yet important details were skimmed over",?
"I think the fact that they left out Prongs and the reason behind HarryUs Patronus being a stag upset me the most ",?
"Like how long would it have taken just to say that was his fatherUs AnimagusI also really didnUt like how they showed Peter Pettigrew in the movie on the map wandering through Hogwarts because it wasnUt a surprise in the scene when Sirius finally appears ",?
"Bad planning there",?
"Two other scenes I didnUt think were portrayed very well were the Quidditch match with the dementors and the discussion about Sirius and his involvement with HarryUs parents seriously how awkward was thatAnyway back to the book ",?

"About Remus ",?
"About Sirius ",?
"About everyone ",?
"One of my other thoughts was how WRONG it was for Ron and Hermoine to end up together ",?
"I amp probably n the minority with that one but I dont understand why they did ",?
"Its so weird seeing them not really be bffs in the first couple of books and then become a couple ",?
"I dont want to imagine how these two such adorable kids will grow up to well ",?
"Yeah ",?
"Which also brings me to Harry and Ginny ",?
"I never ever ever liked the idea of those two ",?
"It was too random for my tastes ",?
"It seemed force ",?
"They shouldnt have ended up together ",?
"Hell while I was reading this book I was wondering if I would have liked the ending of the th book a little bit more had JK pulled a Luke Skywalker and left Harry single ",?
"I love Sirius to bits and pieces he is my fav character but sometimes I wonder about him and James ",?
"I dont agree with the way they treated Snape ",?
"They were bullies ",?
"It hurts me to say that but they were ",?
"Snape was an annoying pain the ass but he was also somewhat powerless compared to them ",?
"They did some pretty awful things to him and it sometimes makes me wonder why I love Sirius so much ",?
"Lily isnt that much better in my eyes ",?
"I actually realize that I may be too harsh in judging her but I cannot help how I feel ",?
"She basically cut off all ties to her muggle life and embraced everything James offered ",?
"Her life seemed to revolve around him ",?
"His best friends were hers and yeah ",?
"It always pains me to imagine how Snape must have felt ",?
"She may have hated James initially but when Snape became a douche bag what did she do",?
"First of all she knew him for almost all her life she should have known better and should have seen through his bullshit second ",?
"she kind of did marry the guy who bullied her exbest friend ",?
"That breaks some sort of code doesnt itI mean whenever Harry mentioned that wedding photo and the best man who was their best friend it kind of just broke my heart into little pieces because at that point Snape held no value in Lilys heart whereas for Snape well we all know how it was ",?
"Despite how I feel about Harrys parents ",?
"I love this book to bits ",?

"However while Sirius is an interesting character I donUt love him like so many others doWhile I love this book there are somethings that donUt make sense ",?
"Firstly Bogarts in this book donUt show real fears as even when I was my fears are not things like spiders and mummyUs but more abstract like harm happening to my family ",?
"Another thing is how come Fred and George never noticed that an unknown man was in either Percy or RonUs room on the maraudersU map",?
"Also if Hogsmead is the only muggle free place then how come most wizards have no understanding of the muggle world",?
"Finally it is obvious the Rowling had not planned the Deathly Hallows as here is this all powerful invisibility cloak which is meant to hide a person from everything but apparently can be seen on a map made by teenage boysI love Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the entire series and I would recommend it to everyone ",?

"There is an irony here that Rowling seems to profit from the reader leaning on Chekhovian Realism in a story where the psychology and meaning are so contrived and poorlyexecuted that it cannot be considered with that genreAs ever Rowlings adoption of characters themes and tropes from other British authors prove to be her best and most powerful elements ",?
"From Mr Darcy to Gandalf to Gaiman she runs the gamut arms outstretched and grasping gleefullyOf course for those who argue there are only XX stories scientifically defined as somewhere between and Rowlings gentle lending is not much of a literary crime ",?
"Quite the opposite she is not an author who could create from whole cloth her strength lies in combination of elements and in romantic adventureAnd though her disparate story elements are as hastily built as old Winchester Manor and as unkind to see from afar traveling interiorilythough sometimes needlessly confusingprovides a view of many wellconstructed and beautiful rooms a lovely little tour ",?

"Even the Ministery of Magic would not sign it for famous Harry Potter because there is another reason ",?
"The reason is that the Minestery of Magic Mr Fudge thinks that Sirius Black a prizoner that killed people in a curse is after Harry ",?
"Black worked under Voldemort and hates Harry for making Voldemort lose his powersSo Fudge wants to keep Harry safe in HogwartsAlso Harry wants revenge ",?
"He hears that Black killed his parents Black was Harrys dads best friend and was a spy for Voldemort ",?
"Black had betrayed Voldemort ",?
"But it was not Black that had killed his parents ",?
"It was Peter Pettigrew who had been living years as a rat and no normal rat Rons pet Scabbers ",?
"He had powers to transform into a shape of an animal ",?

"This was always my favourite of the four books IUve read and I was actually a little reluctant to finish it and move on to the next ",?
"I enjoyed HarryUs relationships with Lupin and the brief glimpse of his relationship with Sirius and the way that their inclusion expands the world a little and gives us a hint of HarryUs parentsU lives and also of the dark frightened world before Voldemort was defeatedThe Dementors to me are more frightening than VoldemorBack to my Harry Potter reread",?

"At least as far as IUve read in the books he canUt take away your capacity for hope even if he plunges you into despair ",?
"The DementorsU the moment when Sirius cringes in front of them near the end is horrible ",?
"TheyUre the first real signs of a darker touch to the wizarding world something that canUt just kill you but can steal your soul U Voldemort canUt do thatThe teenage drama of Ron and Hermione isU less fun ",?
"I gather it pretty much carries on as it is and that maybe itUs meant to foreshadow their relationship being different to the relationship with Harry and itUs not really an aspect IUm interested in ",?
"Honestly IUm not particularly fond of the idea of any pairing up in these books U unless itUs Sirius and Lupin ",?
"UhEnjoyed the reread though IUm not sure I enjoyed it to the same extent I used toOriginally posted here ",?
"People love this book I know and I feel bad about giving it just two stars ",?
"But look JK Rowling has a great imagination and is skilled at worldbuilding but those dont automatically add up to a good book ",?
"Writing skills are necessary as is character development ",?
"And those are sorely lacking here ",?

"Why",?
"Because a spot of underage magic is nothing compared to the more pressing matter of an escaped dangerous convict Sirius Black ",?
"A follower of Voldemort Black has broken out of the wizard prison Azkaban for the apparently express purpose of scouring out and murdering Harry PotterSo another year at Hogwarts starts with the spectre of Sirius Black hanging over everyones heads ",?
"But there is also a a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher Remus Lupin who seems to know his grindylows from his Hinkypunks ",?
"There are also the muchawaited trips into the glorious Hogsmeade ",?
"But there is also a wee bit of puzzlement for Harry as to why people keep telling him NOT to go looking for Sirius Black ",?

"The whole story of the Marauders is also beautiful and tragic at the same time and it just messes with my feelingsTHE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS NOT ONLY FOR THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN BUT ALSO FOR THE GOBLET OF FIRE AND ORDER OF THE PHOENIX The first thing Id like to discuss is that and I only noticed this when rereading it this book is basically the introduction to the complication of the entire series ",?
"Professor Trelawneys prediction points out that the servant of Voldemort will set out and help bring the Dark Lord to power and everyone knows she was referring to Peter Pettigrew ",?
"But I didnt realize how important this was until I thought about how in the Goblet of Fire Pettigrew is the one performing the ritual to give Voldemort a new body ",?
"I was literally MINDBLOWN",?
"Can we all just bow down to JK Rowling and her sheer talent of making things fit together perfectly",?
"Rereading it also made me love Sirius and Remus all the more Im sure Im not the only one who thinks theyre absolutely precious ",?
"Pettigrews escape made me all the more sad since I realized that Sirius died Order of the Phoenix without being proven innocent cue the tears and lets not deny it we all got a bit excited when we thought Harry would live with him and get away from those awful Dursleys ",?

"I also noticed how good JK Rowling was at recapping the first two books very quickly and yet covered all the major things you needed to know ",?

"Definitely more interesting than just being told there was something in the newspaperLets gush a little more about J K Rowlings writing ",?
"She has the best blunt honesty that somehow comes off as hilarious ",?
"For example her observation of Aunt Marge loving to criticize people so Harry looks untidy on purpose to please her ",?
"And Ms ",?
"Rowling can spin a web of mystery better than an evil spider from Mirkwood ",?

"After having my son go to school the first time I couldnt imagine how hard it would be to put your kids on a train for an entire semesterOn a side note Im still curious about how special cats are in Harry Potters world since they are important in witch mythology ",?
"In the Harry Potter universe they seem to have more intelligence than an average cat but Im wondering if there is more to them than thatI read this book along with Pottermore and I really enjoyed the rich backstories ",?
"Even though they never show up directly in the plots of her novels its amazing to me the amount of thought that went into even minor characters ",?
"Marge Dursley the awful aunt has an entire backstory that makes everything click about why she acts the way she does ",?
"A huge hallmark of MsRowlings writing is that none of her characters do things without legitimate motivation even if we the reader dont know what it isPottermore ReviewAs far as the Pottermore websites new look and navigation go I hates them both ",?
"Its hard to tell where you are in the story with the new layout ",?
"I really really miss the old layout ",?
"Pottermore now looks like a bad social networking site with way too many sidebars cluttering things up ",?
"Its just unattractive ",?
"I liked the ending quotes that used to be there so you knew where you were and now they are gone ",?
"It feels like you dont need to read the book as much with the new site which is sad ",?
"The one nice thing I have to say about it is kudos to them for being extremely accurate with what happens in the book ",?

"I like how they were going back in time ",?
"And I love how Harry at the end didnt know it the person who cast the Patronus was him because he thought it was his dad and it couldnt be him and its the wizard world so his dad could have been a ghost there doing the spell even though he was a ghost but it was actually Harry but I thought that was an amazing part and the other one that I liked was that they were going back just to save Harrys godfather that was really awesome and even the fact that he was being impatient with whatshisnamePa SnapeMilos LupinBrontUEB Yeah Lupin ",?

"That would be cool ",?
"Anything elseMiloU No thats it oh but I love the book its really coolBrontUEB There is one more thing for me to say though ",?
"Even though I like like one or two maybe of the Gryffindors I mostly like the Slytherins ",?
"I dont know why but you look in ghosts past and you can see Harrys dad hurting and torturing Snape and Snape has been good to Harry and Harry still doesnt like him and Snape was in Slytherin so I just like Slytherin best ",?
"Oh but I like Ginny from Gryffindor and I love Luna Lovegood the mostMiloU Shes RavenclawBrontUEB She wears a blue scarfMiloU Yeah RavenclawPa So what should we read next",?

"I cant wait to read the next page books which will hopefully last me more than a dayAs usual Dumbledore astonishes me with the pure magic that his brain and heart are Hagrid makes me want to hug and pet him in a completely nonsexual way and I might have developed a slight tendency to daydream about a conflicted and lusty romance between Remus Lupin and Sirius Black but thats one of the best parts of reading nonromance novels right",?

"Both characters are strong and willing to stand up I just feel a different kind of love for Sirius and Lupin Also we cant forget the story of the Marauders ",?
"When it comes to them I cant even begin to describe how emotional I become GLORIOUS stars of course ",?
"In my opinion the Harry Potter series has one of the best casts of characters I have ever read ",?
"J K Rowling really has a way of bringing her characters to life and making them seem so very realistic ",?
"The friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione takes on a different tone in this book ",?

"This just added fuel to the fire of my prediction that they will someday be more than friends ",?
"As always all three of them acted very heroically especially Harry and Hermione and once again Harry had the opportunity to show his amazing capacity for mercy in this case to one who didnt really deserve it which was a beautiful thing to meI must say that I liked Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban the best so far ",?
"Even though this was a reread for me I had forgotten many of the little details and rediscovering them made for a very enjoyable time ",?
"Still my favourite Harry Potter bookAt this point it isnt just the comfort of returning to Hogwarts and this magical world that I love ",?
"No this is the book where I really got stung with the Potter bug ",?

"and the list goes onMaybe this is due partly to the fact that the books mature with the characters each volume growing in danger and in scope or that Rowling improved her craft too ",?
"Whichever this is the novel where it gets serious ",?
"The hugeness of what happened and of what is yet to happen hits you ",?
"You can see all these elements appearing in your vision and youre just flabbergasted at what they could meanUltimately I think this seriess success resides in the fact that Rowling has the power to make all of us feel wonder whatever age we are ",?
"And yes I solemnly swear that I am up to no good always O ",?
"This is the first book in The Harry Potter series that impressed me in terms of the plotting and overall development ",?

"Does that give him much personality",?
"Well personally I find him a rather boring character and am more interested in the side characters around him characters who provide greater definition to Harry than anything elseThat said Im definitely moving on to the next book when I can ",?
"More to see the continuation of this story finish the series and hope for greater improvement ",?

"There may be some spoilers ahead but can these books really be spoiled at this pointSo this time through Prisoner of Azkaban something struck me about our general pop cultural acceptance that Albus Dumbledore is the goodest of the good the best of the best the most heroic of the heroes in Rowlings world trumping even Harry because his sacrifice is genuineI am not interested in Rowlings intentions for the characters in this I am interested only in what I see ",?

"And what I see tells me that only one character is good and great and heroic in the kind of goodness and greatness and heroism that interests meI am not saying that Dumbledores a bad guy ",?
"Hes no Voldemort obviously although I am not entirely convinced that Voldemort is the embodiment of evil we often think of him as and he leads the battle against Voldemorts fascist rise which makes him the Churchillian leader of English myth ",?
"He does sacrifice himself ",?
"He does risk his health and welfare to destroy horcruxes ",?
"He does protect Harry while moving the boy around like the chess piece that the boy is ",?
"But what strikes me is that everything Dumbledore accomplishes is accomplished to maintain the status quo and the status quo I see is far from worthy of maintenance ",?
"It is a status quo with a classic English power structure rich white guys at the top Dumbledore anyone and everyone else beneath ",?
"It is a status quo with the usual class divides ",?
"It is a status quo with some pretty hefty racism goblins and giants and other Others ",?
"It is a status quo with institutionalized slavery and Dumbledore himself uses a small army of House Elves to run Hogwarts without a hint of distaste ",?
"It is a status quo with a prison system of torture ",?
"And Dumbledore does nothing to disrupt that status quo ",?
"In my opinion the character who is the goodest of the good the best of the best the most heroic of the heroes is the one who rails against the status quo while simultaneously battling Voldemort and she fights Mr Riddle far more significantly than the rest of the wizarding world ",?
"And she fights the status quo in spite of being mocked for her beliefs by everyone at every turn ",?
"For me the paragon we should aspire to is Hermione Granger ",?
"Not Dumbledore and certainly not Harry Potter ",?
"So with that in mind whats not to love about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban ",?
"It is the moment that Hermione comes into her own ",?
"She is the key to the resolution ",?

"Then we get to know a little bit more about Harrys dark past and its influence into his current life situation ",?
"There are also the Dementors which bring a whole new meaning to the word evil ",?
"Seriously those guys are creepy ",?
"Nonetheless Harry is back at Hogwarts with his friends and soon he is taught how to confront the Dementors with the assistance of my favorite Defense Against Dark Arts teacher of all time Professor LupinThere is also the addition of a whole new scenario Hogsmeade ",?
"Man what I wouldnt give to go and visit that place ",?
"Due to Harry having to sneak his way into Hogsmeade we get to know some more about his fathers activities while he was a student as well as some new secret places in Hogwarts which is really cool ",?
"Whats more Hermione starts taking some action against Draco and his troupe of sonsofbitches Slytherin friends which is amazing to see ",?
"This book really made me respect Hermione a lot moreFrom the half of the book forward the story gets a very fast pace meaning that things get absurdly intense ",?
"Theres a lot of action much more than the previous books boundaries are broken secrets are revealed and Rowling forcs us to get used to the darker shade to the story that would come to be dominant in the next books with the ascension of dark forces and everything ",?
"Overall theres not a thing that I dont like in this book",?
"Interesting quotes that I didnt include in the review The consequences of our actions are always so complicated so diverse that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed ",?

"As well as realizing once again that the movies definitely left a lot of awesome out of this story ",?
"And in my opinion this is where the series really start taking off for the more darker storyline which follows through the rest of the booksI dont wanna go into details in a super indepth review but would much rather pick up the next book and continue this reread marathon Nika and Ive got going ",?
"However I have to say that Sirius Black and Remus Lupin along with a James Potter whom I wish both us readers as well as Harry would have gotten to know better are some of my absolute favorite characters and I love the crazy start to their relationship with their best friends sonLoved all of it ",?
"For the xnumber of times ",?
"Brilliant ",?
"You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us",?
"You think that we dont recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble",?
"Your father is alive in you Harry and shows himself most plainly when you have need of him ",?
"This is definitely my favorite book in the series so far ",?
"I just loved how this book felt like the true beginning to the plot with the introduction of the Marauders and the more detailed account of Harrys past ",?
"This book was the first book where Harry and the crew felt like they were growing up ",?
"In books one and two they were still very childish and young ",?
"But this book felt a lot like a loss of innocence in a way and I really enjoyed that ",?

"I needed to figure out why why was this series so popular",?
"What makes this a huge cultural phenomena while a book series like Percy Jackson is only a bestseller that adults dont jizz themselves over",?
"Having read two of the PJ and HP I decided I needed to investigate this a little more ",?
"It didnt hurt that I was bored last weekend and watched the second Harry Potter movie and found myself enjoying it and actually watched it all in one sitting something I havent done for a movie in months ",?
"Ok ",?
"Going into HP I was skeptical ",?

"They were about Greek mythology and while silly at times they were a pretty fun take on all of the creatures and Gods met in The Odyssey ",?
"Ill take stories involving Athena and Gorgons over Dumbledore and Voldemort any day ",?
"Strangely I was wrong about Harry Potter ",?
"I hate to admit when my prejudices are wrong but apparently I am not infallible ",?
"While I still stand behind my judgment of books one and two being fairly fun but predictable and too episodic for my taste book three seemed to move drastically beyond the almost cookiecutter quality of Rowlings first two forays and created a very full world that had enough depth to the characters and actions that I stopped feeling like I was being dragged along by the nose through an unengaging text ",?
"I dont know what to really say except I really ended up enjoying it enough so that I looked forward to starting book which I have started but have to say isnt living up to this book so far ",?
"When I was shamefully buying this book a cashier told me that this was her favorite in the series ",?
"Someone else stopped to tell me while I sat on the stoop behind work that it was their favorite too ",?
"Im wondering if this is the pinnacle of the series and that after this it just becomes a need to keep on reading hoping that the heights of book will be reached again and feeling compelled to finish a series that one could feel very invested in ",?
"I dont know ",?
"As a side note I had the thought that while I made fun of adults who loudly proclaimed their love for the HP books especially around the time when the fourth one came out this was the moment the little nerdling entered on to my myopic cultural radar and I had my initial disgust at reading newspaper articles with adults saying they love the books and they arent kids books blah blah blah I kind of get what they are saying ",?
"I dont agree with them I dont think its the greatest thing ever written and I have lots of books I liked more than this one but for a person who reads shitty books and lives on a diet of Grisham and Patterson with some other easy to digest cookie cutter adult novelists thrown in this book would read like literature ",?

"Theres much familiar ground to retread that annoying bully Malfoy and his overriding father Snape and his sinister schooling new experiments that sound as dangerous as they do educationalbut also some new issues arises namely wondering when Black will show his face and what will happen when that showdown finally strikesIts frustrating a little to not see more of Voldemort yet so much build up and Im already eager for appearance but the book delves further into the history of that night when Harrys parents were viciously slaughtered ",?
"It was written well into the form of the dementers eliciting memories in Harrys psyche and theres a twist in the story that shows theres more to the legends and stories than previously known ",?
"As usual misconceptions and halftruths for crimesI do have to say the wizarding world loses a brownie point from me because of the dementers ",?
"Theyre awesome villains creepy inventions that serve the story well but it disturbs me prisoners are constantly tortured by them ",?

"Finally he seems to be learning some interesting things ",?
"This new professor is a welcome addition to the book he plays a lot into the story being easy to get attached toFamiliar focuses are brought clearer like the Willow Tree and Invisibility Cloak but we also get new goodies like that amusing Map deeper journey into Diagon Alley and of course Hogsmeade and its delightful shops ",?
"Dumbledore has always been awesome but hes even better here while he stands up for Hagrid and actually listens to Harry and others with sanity and reasonable instead of hilarity and prejudiceIt was frustrating at the end when there was so much time people struggled to convince of a truth its a pet peeve when a main character wont listen for a second or if someone is trying to tell the truth but isnt believed ",?
"I end up wanting to slap people around over that but its a small annoyance in the midst of greatness ",?
"Theres a surprise at the end that I didnt see coming in the form of fur I had suspected one surprise the other I didnt The rescue of a surprising hero was also well done and crafted by Rowling who has proven herself to be incredibly inventiveThe series continues strong getting better with each installment ",?

"I surprised myself by liking itI enjoyed this book also ",?
"Rowling may not have the most elegant of prose styles but she has a wealth of imagination and the ability to write a carefully plotted story with some well drawn characters in it ",?
"Theres a nice mix of the magical and the mundane throughout the book ",?
"There are invisability cloaks and magical maps but there are also essays to write bullies and intimidating teachers to endure and final exams to survive that help give children and those of us who remember being children things we can relate toEvents in this book also take a decidely darker and more adult turn as the story progresses and it does a good job of adding emotional depth to the back story ",?

"The rat did smell like a rat yes but there was also something else ",?
"Something ",?
"human ",?
"It was just like that big black dog hed met on the grounds the other day ",?
"Every instinct in him had screamed to run away but there was that smell ",?
"And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity ",?

"Well see about that ",?
"I have a great big doggie friend whos just aching to get his jaws around youHe barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad ",?
"It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws ",?
"And then against all of Crookshanks previous experience it grew",?
"It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape ",?
"Crookshanks goggled ",?
"Of all the things hed expected from this rat this wasnt it ",?
"The human grabbed at him but Crookshanks was too fast ",?

"He was pale and thin and still looked ratty ",?
"Think Peter think he said ",?

"And then he bit the ball of his handBlood dripped out leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets ",?
"Theyll think it was you he said ",?
"Theyll leave me for dead and Ill be free to rejoin my Lord He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Rons bed ",?
"Its not safe here anymore He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window ",?
"Perched on the windowsill he looked over at Crookshanks hiding place ",?
"If I were human he said the fall would kill me ",?
"But as a rat His body rippled and twisted and shrank and then there was an old grey rat on the sill ",?
"Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping offAfter a minute or two Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe his thoughts dark ",?
"The RedHaired Boy was going to be angry and so was the Girl ",?
"But more importantly the Dog was going to be furious ",?

"I believe that like these new villains like any dark force that attacks Harry manages to make the best of him I mean in terms of magic those moments where shows his power and his courage are thanks to this kind of villains who are amazing and are very well describedAt first I was somewhat irritated by the absurd fights between Hermione and Ron I was so angry with them ",?
"I havent stopped love them I couldnt but guys reallyOn the other hand I really liked Hermiones rol in this book she revealing her secret helping Harry and everything they spend together I think their friendship has grown even moreIn fact my favorite chapters of books are about theyThe revelations in this book are incredible everything about Sirius Black and Lupin left me shocked I did not expect anything like that and I loved it one of the things I enjoy the most is to know more about Harrys parents and how has been the past in Hogwarts",?

"In his third year at Hogwarts Harry Potter learns that a dangerous man named Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban ",?
"Harry then overhears the fact that Black is the reason his parents are dead as Black sold them out to Voldemort and then killed people in broad daylight ",?

"Hes not as present in this book but he has always had a part in the series and I completely forgot he existed",?
"I know they cant include everything in the movies but I wish Peeves had been includedCharlie Weasley Ron had yet ANOTHER sibling that is only mentioned in the films",?
"This one is the cool brother in EgyptCho Chang and Cedric Diggory there are soooooo many mentions of Cho and Cedric in this book",?
"I never really noticed Cedric until the th book where he becomes prominent ",?
"And this is the book where Harrys crush on Cho began ",?
"Stomach fluttersMore details on Whomping WillowShrieking Shack This may be a spoiler for those of you who havent read it but the Whomping Willow was actually planted to hide Lupins werewolfism as well as the shrieking shack to hide him ",?
"I thought this little tidbit was super interesting along with the details of how Black escaped Azkaban ",?
"And just in general I love JK Rowlings ability to tie things together ",?
"Theres so much in this book that becomes important later and tiny little details and sharp wit that make me giggle ",?
"So in a small factoid this book is probably my least favorite of the entire series ",?
"Its good obviously but for some reason I like all the other ones better ",?
"The movie well its my second to last favorite just ahead of that godawful Goblet of Fire film which ruined everything but I digress ",?
"The movie director added so many unnecessary things that werent in the book and I wish he hadnt so he could of kept the good stuff",?
"And Ive heard a rumor that he didnt even read the fucking book until JK kept vetoing all of his weird ideas ",?

"Thus Prisoner of Azkaban carries a hefty helping of something so terribly thrilling it nearly pains me to think that too many adults view these as childrens books because Jo dove headfirst into the Gringotts vault and crafted what",?
"A SPY THRILLERHah",?
"Expecto PatronumHitchockian to the last word Jo uses her mastery of psychology to create a false villain in Sirius Black deepening the story to masterful levels with her careful use of incredibly dangerous ingredients such as the Marauders Map and the Time Turner ",?

"This is the place where the series leave comfortable and fluffy status of simple children books and slowly crosses in to an adult territory ",?
"I would call it young adult but the modern understanding of the term demands a presence of heartbreaking romance and Harry Potter does not fit ",?
"To make a long story short do not expect a happy ending here but do expect some quite dark momentsI thought about reducing the otherwise perfect rating by one star because of some minor inconsistencies and the whole Time Turner thingy ",?
"I would not call the latter Deux Ex Machina as it did not come up from nowhere but it was way too convenient for the final resolution for me ",?
"The fact that it completely disappears from the series never again to be heard about does not help any ",?
"Still this was not big enough annoyance for the lower rating so the stars remain ",?

"My own journey with Harry Potter started a long time ago ",?
"But when Delee mentioned she had never read it before I knew I had to change that ",?
"And I think some deeper part of her understood that if our friendship were to stand the test of time she would have to read them ",?
"When she gave stars to book I knew I had her",?

"I tend to give people a heads up that the first books of the series in general are aimed at a much younger crowd than the last ",?
"I have to say I was shocked but very excited to see that once again Delee had given shiny stars to Chamber as well ",?
"So here we are ",?
"Our journey began in March of and I have been trying my best to be a patient and understanding leader ",?
"Sometimes I take her hand and gently guide her other times I chase her with a wooden spoon threatening severe punishments if she doesnt commit to a date to begin the next book ",?
"But I do try to be patient ",?
"I hope she knows that ",?
" We picked up another buddy for this read The Enchanting Ivonne ",?
"When it comes to the world of Harry Potter there is little that I am unfamiliar with ",?
"And there is even less that I wonUt do to get people to read it ",?
"Now that Delee has the third book under her belt I think it will take less and less persuasion to get her on board for the next one ",?
"In fact we finished this one in December and weUre starting Goblet in March",?
"MARCH ",?
"ThatUs not that far away",?
"Prisoner has been a fan favorite since it came out ",?
"I think it was one of the most popular of the movies as well ",?

"A crazy murdering psycho is on the loose ",?

"How was he able to remain sane in a place as awful as Azkaban",?
"They say he was lucid and even downright chatty whenever the Minister for Magic had to do a check on the prison ",?
"Is he just that crazy that the dementors donUt affect him",?

"We learn to find our happiest moments in our weakest and most awful ones ",?
"We learn to forgive and we learn to show mercy ",?
"We learn what it means to have a second chance ",?
"And we are introduced to Buckbeak ",?
"Prisoner of Azkaban is a great story and added a nice dynamic to the Harry Potter series ",?
"It is the only one like it within the series where the other ones can be compared fairly easily to one another ",?
"I am so thankful to have such an incredible friend agree to accompany me on this journey ",?
"I am so thankful that she trusts me to guide her ",?

"It was clear that the hormones were finally kicking in because they had many arguments in this novel ",?
"Ron and Hermione in particular often got on each others nerves for reasons both shallow and significant ",?
"As for Harry I was grinning from ear to ear when he had finally met a girl that made his stomach drop in the best possible way ",?
"With all that said the interactions between these beloved characters made me reminisce about my late teenage life evoking in me feelings of longing happiness and even gratitude ",?
"And if I must say so my admiration for Hermione grows stronger by the bookHonestly I probably enjoyed this book so much also because I watched the movie adaptation beforehand times ",?
"It was nearly effortless for me to imagine all the intriguing events that were happening which was practically a huge bonus to my reading experience ",?
"Furthermore I was actually delighted to spot the differences between the movie and book although I already knew the story by heart through the movie I still experienced moments of blissful enlightenment ",?
"In conclusion I would like to apologize for putting this book on hold for almost a month ",?

"A smart girl madly in love with a narcisist",?
"COME ON",?
"But here she walk out of Divination class ",?
"Not that I approved her insulting Professor Trelawney ",?
"Its just that a high IQ person like Hermione doesnt rely on predictions ",?

"Yes ",?
"RIDICULOUS ",?
"Dementor vs BasiliskDementor left my heart with spookiness ",?
"It still buried deep inside me ",?
"The way Rowling depicted how scary and demented this creature is is so real ",?
"I got goosebumps even when I read it in the daylight ",?
"But I have to say that Basilisk is still the best horror of all Harry Potter series ",?
"I still can hear it hissing Kill ",?
"Kill ",?
"in my ears ",?
"Plus there were Moaning Myrtle and Aragog ",?
"They both added to the frightening moment of my reading experience ",?

"Wooooo ",?
"But then I have to kill you haha ",?
"Buckbeak vs FawkesWell I cant choose between these two birds ",?
"Both of them have their own appeal ",?
"Buckbeak is so cute and funny while hes a big creature ",?
"And Fawkes is so wise and affectionate just like Dumbledore ",?
"They both strong and loyal ",?
"One thing differentiates them is that Fawkess teardrops can heal wound while Buckbeaks cant ",?
"So I think Fawkes winsNow I cant wait to read the fourth book",?

"This is where the private schools score over staterun schools they can accommodate a few cultured madmen on the staff without having to offer explanationsUD I personally sometimes learned interesting life lessons from the teachers who hated teaching or who were on the brink of a nervous breakdown ",?
"They may not have been the best at teaching chemistry or English or whatever but I learned to cope with people who had power over my life and who were not having a good timeRead as part of my Halloween Book Bingo to count towards the Witches square ",?
