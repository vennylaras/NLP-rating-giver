IU+2019m glad now that I did read the book, because I got so much more out of it. There were SO many things going on behind the scenes that I didnU+2019t even realizeU+2026Everything makes so much more sense when youU+2019ve read the book. So many little yet important details were skimmed over! I think the fact that they left out Prongs and the reason behind HarryU+2019s Patronus being a stag upset me the most. Like, how long would it have taken just to say that was his fatherU+2019s Animagus?I also really didnU+2019t like how they showed Peter Pettigrew (in the movie) on the map wandering through Hogwarts, because it wasnU+2019t a surprise in the scene when Sirius finally appears. Bad planning there! Two other scenes I didnU+2019t think were portrayed very well were the Quidditch match with the dementors and the discussion about Sirius and his involvement with HarryU+2019s parents (seriously, how awkward was that?).Anyway, back to the book. The map!! I loooved the MarauderU+2019s Map. I totally want one!! I loved that it was created by the four best friends and the whole backstory behind it.I also love that Sirius was portrayed as a bad guy but he really wasnU+2019t. The whole book was building him up as this evil villain, and the perception was broken when Harry finally met him. I think Sirius is my favorite character of the series so far!Side note: Okay, am I freaking tripping, or was Dumbledore's quote from the movie, \"Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light\" NOT in the book?! I mean, I love that quote to death and I swear I never remember reading it, and surely I would have remembered that...?!?!Favorite quote\"You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble?\"This review was originally posted on Novel Heartbeat.

I couldn't. I just wanted to bawl my heart out because. BECAUSE. We all know what would happen. I thought a lot of things while reading this book. It just made me think about the whole series as a whole. Like Snape and why he was the way he was. About Remus. About Sirius. About everyone. One of my other thoughts was how WRONG it was for Ron and Hermoine to end up together. I amp probably n the minority with that one but I don't understand why they did. It's so weird seeing them not really be bffs in the first couple of books and then become a couple. I don't want to imagine how these two, such adorable kids, will grow up to well. Yeah. Which also brings me to Harry and Ginny. I never ever ever liked the idea of those two. It was too random for my tastes. It seemed force. They shouldn't have ended up together. Hell while I was reading this book, I was wondering if I would have liked the ending of the 7th book a little bit more had J.K. pulled a Luke Skywalker and left Harry single. I love Sirius to bits and pieces (he is my fav character) but sometimes I wonder about him and James. I don't agree with the way they treated Snape. They were bullies. It hurts me to say that but they were. Snape was an annoying pain the ass but he was also somewhat powerless compared to them. They did some pretty awful things to him and it sometimes makes me wonder why I love Sirius so much. Lily isn't that much better in my eyes. I actually realize that I may be too harsh in judging her but I cannot help how I feel. She basically cut off all ties to her muggle life and embraced everything James offered. Her life seemed to revolve around him. His best friends were hers and yeah. It always pains me to imagine how Snape must have felt. She may have hated James initially but when Snape became a douche bag what did she do? First of all, she knew him for almost all her life, she should have known better and should have seen through his bullshit, second.. she kind of did marry the guy who bullied her ex-best friend. That breaks some sort of code doesn't it?I mean whenever Harry mentioned that wedding photo and the best man who was 'their best friend' it kind of just broke my heart into little pieces because at that point Snape held no value in Lily's heart whereas for Snape, well we all know how it was. Despite how I feel about Harry's parents. I love this book to bits. Also I thought I'd make a list of my favorite characters, it might explain why re-reading this series sucks.-Sirius-Snape-Remus-Dumbledore-Dobby-Hagrid-Fred-George-Neville-Draco"},

However, while Sirius is an interesting character I donU+2019t love him like so many others do.While I love this book there are somethings that donU+2019t make sense. Firstly Bogarts in this book donU+2019t show real fears, as even when I was 10 my fears are not things like spiders and mummyU+2019s but more abstract like harm happening to my family. Another thing is how come Fred and George never noticed that an unknown man was in either Percy or RonU+2019s room on the maraudersU+2019 map? Also if Hogsmead is the only muggle free place then how come most wizards have no understanding of the muggle world? Finally it is obvious the Rowling had not planned the Deathly Hallows as here is this all powerful invisibility cloak which is meant to hide a person from everything but apparently can be seen on a map made by teenage boys.I love Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the entire series and I would recommend it to everyone.

There is an irony here: that Rowling seems to profit from the reader leaning on Chekhovian Realism in a story where the psychology and meaning are so contrived and poorly-executed that it cannot be considered with that genre.As ever, Rowlings adoption of characters, themes, and tropes from other British authors prove to be her best and most powerful elements. From Mr. D'arcy to Gandalf to Gaiman, she runs the gamut, arms outstretched and grasping gleefully.Of course, for those who argue 'there are only XX stories' (scientifically defined as somewhere between 1 and 77), Rowling's gentle lending is not much of a literary crime. Quite the opposite: she is not an author who could create from whole cloth, her strength lies in combination of elements and in romantic adventure.And though her disparate story elements are as hastily built as old Winchester Manor, and as unkind to see from afar, traveling interiorily--though sometimes needlessly confusing--provides a view of many well-constructed and beautiful rooms: a lovely little tour. At the risk of insulting someone who misses my intent, the greatest gift to her merry throngs may be that they cannot step back and look upon the whole picture. A house of cards is a pretty feat, after all.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"},

Nobody is purely evil or purely good, and yet everyone that surrounds Harry and his friends is exactly that. It gets tiresome.There's plenty to like about this book. I love the descriptions of Hogwarts, of the people there, and of the classes. I can easily picture everything, and I find myself wishing I could attend Hogwarts, too.

Constant barbs make Harry lose his temper and unknowingly inflate Aunt Marge (a serious bit of Non-Permissive Underage Magic). Resigned to the fact that he will be expelled from Hogwarts, Harry sets off on his own and after one bone-rattling ride on the magical Knight Bus, unfortunately ends up meeting the Minister of Magic himself. Talk 'bout rotten luck.But he gets off scot free. Why? Because a spot of underage magic is nothing compared to the more pressing matter of an escaped dangerous convict, Sirius Black. A follower of Voldemort, Black has broken out of the wizard prison Azkaban for the apparently express purpose of scouring out and murdering Harry Potter.So another year at Hogwarts starts with the spectre of Sirius Black hanging over everyone's heads. But there is also a a new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin who seems to know his grindylows from his Hinkypunks. There are also the much-awaited trips into the glorious Hogsmeade. But there is also a wee bit of puzzlement for Harry as to why people keep telling him NOT to go looking for Sirius Black. After all, one doesn't go looking for his prospective murderer! But BlackU+2019s past is entwined with HarryU+2019s and thereU+2019s serious evil underfoot.Adding to the joyous proceedings are the shudder-worthy Dementors. This was RowlingU+2019s imagination at itU+2019s scariest best. Faceless, cloaked figures with decaying hands who feed on human happiness, they leave despair and depression in their wake. Infact,Rowling introduced some of her most innovative creations in this book: The Knight-Bus, Dementors, Boggarts, Hogsmeade, The MarauderU+2019s Map, Patronuses, Hippogriffs, Animagi and the Time-Turner. She also created two extremely memorable characters in Remus Lupin and Sirius Black.   Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban takes delightfully shocking twists and turns and keeps the reader completely smitten. For me, this book reaffirmed what true friendship and loyalty is all about. I am not ashamed to say that I teared up more than once.The book was perfect in every way: narration, build-up and unexpected surprises, all tied together in Rowling's inimitable style."},

I'm simply doing this because there are a couple of things I noticed while reading the book that I'd like to share and I'd also like to praise J.K. Rowling because she's just absolutely amazing. I'm not going to deny that the Prisoner of Azkaban is my favorite of all the HP books, mainly due to the introduction of the Marauders and the fact that they are of immediate importance to the story, they're not just there until their significance in the story is only revealed at, for example, the end of the series (Snape). The whole story of the Marauders is also beautiful and tragic at the same time and it just messes with my feelings.***THE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS NOT ONLY FOR THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, BUT ALSO FOR THE GOBLET OF FIRE AND ORDER OF THE PHOENIX.***  The first thing I'd like to discuss is that, and I only noticed this when re-reading it, this book is basically the introduction to the complication of the entire series. Professor Trelawney's prediction points out that the servant of Voldemort will set out and help bring the Dark Lord to power and everyone knows she was referring to Peter Pettigrew. But I didn't realize how important this was until I thought about how, in the Goblet of Fire, Pettigrew is the one performing the ritual to give Voldemort a new body. I was literally MIND-BLOWN! Can we all just bow down to J.K. Rowling and her sheer talent of making things fit together perfectly? Rereading it also made me love Sirius and Remus all the more, I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks they're absolutely precious. Pettigrew's escape made me all the more sad since I realized that Sirius died (Order of the Phoenix) without being proven innocent *cue the tears* and, let's not deny it, we all got a bit excited when we thought Harry would live with him and get away from those awful Dursleys. And once again, I'd like to commend J.K. Rowling for creating characters so wonderful and so dear to all our hearts.5/5 stars for this work of art! (I know this review was pretty long, but I just wanted to share my thoughts with you guys because my mind was literally blown, also, thanks for reading this far!)"},

The thing I love about the Harry Potter series is that it ages and matures along with its characters, and while the first two books are fun, they're much more juvenile, as Harry and co. are only 11 and 12. Thirteen, however, is the year you start dealing with emotions of a deeper nature, and you start growing up more. Thirteen is when things get hard, and Prisoner of Azkaban embraces that and allows the characters to go through it.Harry, Ron, and Hermione have always had to deal with things over their heads, but in Prisoner of Azkaban, they have to start making tough choices, and some of them aren't always the right ones. Harry gets more arrogant, foolish, and hotheaded, Ron lets his temper and stubbornness take control of him, and Hermione fails to reel the two of them in with her pretentiousness. All three are stressed, and it takes this year of fighting and self-doubt to force their bond into a stronger one, one that they'll need in the upcoming years.Thirteen is a tough year for anyone, but with a murderer on the loose who's got you in his crosshairs, I can only imagine it would make it ten times worse.When I was younger, POA used to be my favorite of the as-yet-released books because it felt different, because it had a cool time-travel sequence, and because the mystery and confrontation at the end were just so clever and interesting. It's still my favorite of the first three, but some of the later books take over as my all-time favorite; but that being said, Prisoner of Azkaban is still a wonderful installment of the Harry Potter series, and introduced some of the greatest characters of the series.What's not to love? Crookshanks, Butterbeer, Buckbeak, Sirius, Lupin, Trelawney, Hermione hitting Draco, time travel, morphing into animals, two weeks in Diagon Alley, great Quidditch... Love."},

The title of the essay, \"Witch Burning in the Fourteenth Century Was Completely Pointless - discuss\", is just charming.  There is so much great humor in the books that just didn't make it into the movie.  Ron's phone call is my favorite.  Even her book titles are funny.  \"Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn Foul.\"  I just get giddy, now matter how many times I read these books, at the creativity and humor for even the minor details.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was so fun to re-read because she does an excellent job of foreshadowing.  It's so fun seeing something differently for the first time or knowing what she is talking about this time around instead of it being a mystery. I also noticed how good J.K. Rowling was at recapping the first two books very quickly and yet covered all the major things you needed to know.  I don't think I've ever noticed this before but there are a lot of letters and news clippings throughout the book.  I liked how much depth it added.  Definitely more interesting than just being told there was something in the newspaper.Let's gush a little more about J. K. Rowling's writing.  She has the best blunt honesty that somehow comes off as hilarious.  For example, her observation of Aunt Marge loving to criticize people so Harry looks untidy on purpose to please her. And Ms. Rowling can spin a web of mystery better than an evil spider from Mirkwood.  She presents these extremely probable but completely wrong answers to keep you off the trail until she wants you to know the answer.  The best example of this was her clever clues about Sirius Black.Harry's bittersweet life and humble gratitude make him so likable and relatable.  I say bittersweet because he is neglected by his family but his life at school is magical.  Harry is very resilient and can joke about the bad things that people say about him.  I thought it was an admirable quality.  I also liked the life lessons that Harry learns at this point in the series.  Sad things happen to Harry to give an opportunity for better things to happen - like when his broom got completely smashed.Can I just say that I'm totally a Hermione and I would take 6 classes, including Muggle Studies, just to see how wizards viewed them.Something I experienced for the first time was relating to the adults in the story.  After having my son go to school the first time, I couldn't imagine how hard it would be to put your kids on a train for an entire semester.On a side note - I'm still curious about how special cats are in Harry Potter's world since they are important in witch mythology.  In the Harry Potter universe they seem to have more intelligence than an average cat, but I'm wondering if there is more to them than  that.I read this book along with Pottermore and I really enjoyed the rich backstories.  Even though they never show up directly in the plots of her novels, it's amazing to me the amount of thought that went into even minor characters.  Marge Dursley, the awful aunt, has an entire backstory that makes everything click about why she acts the way she does.  A huge hallmark of Ms.Rowling's writing is that none of her characters do things without legitimate motivation even if we, the reader, don't know what it is.Pottermore ReviewAs far as the Pottermore website's new look and navigation go, I hates them both.  It's hard to tell where you are in the story with the new layout.  I really, really miss the old layout.  Pottermore now looks like a bad social networking site with way too many sidebars cluttering things up.  It's just unattractive.  I liked the ending quotes that used to be there so you knew where you were and now they are gone.  It feels like you don't need to read the book as much with the new site, which is sad.  The one nice thing I have to say about it is kudos to them for being extremely accurate with what happens in the book.  That being said, you should definitely check out the site for the awesome backstories and bonus material.  They are pure gold.Read to kids may 15, 2016-September 25, 2016"},

Now that the characters are getting older and things are moving along, I'm finally getting more invested in these books. They were entertaining before but now the good stuff is starting. The plot is getting more complicated and less straight forward, the characters are facing some big moral decisions, and not everyone is simply good or evil.  There was no Voldemort confrontationHarry had a showdown with Voldemort manifestations in the first two books, but not Azkaban. Such a confrontation isn't necessary, but I was sort of thinking it might become a tradition of sorts. I was really looking forward to seeing how Voldemort might work into Azkaban and was kind of disappointed when he didn't make an appearance.  The characters are growing upThis brings me joy but I'm also kind of scared. Teenage years are an interesting time. Some character get real attitude and from the looks of things Harry is going to be one. He's already starting to sass the adults and show major attitude. I just hope the characters stay entertaining and don't get on my nerves like my little sister did during her teenage years.  I understand the fandom's Marauders obsessionI swear half the Harry Potter posts I see on Tumblr are about the Marauders. Which I thought was a strange obsession... until now. I totally get it now. We don't get to see too much of the marauders in Azkaban, but the little glimpses and stories we do get left me wanting to know more about this previous generation of wizards. We really need a book or something about them.  Still waiting for some answers (or I missed something?)There is a high possibility that I missed something while listening to the audiobook, but I feel like I'm missing some important information that is integral to the overarching pot. Mainly why was Voldemort  going after the Potters in the first place? Like I said it's more than likely that I missed the information we got about it or have forgotten it, but if not I really hope we find out soon. I'm getting impatient. I'd also like to know how Voldemort came to power and amassed such a following, and what terribly evil things did he do before killing the Potters?  In SummaryAs the story goes on I become more attached to this world and characters. The first two books were good, but Azkaban has begun to deliver what I've been waiting for: more complicated characters and complex plot lines. I'm still confused about some background aspects to the overarching plot, but I'm hoping those details are filled in during future novels."},

My husband is one of these people and is trying to reform. The one time in my life that GWB has been useful to me. I am also aggravated by foliage pronounced or spelled as foilage. Huh? That doesn't make sense. And I prefer empathic over empathetic. I realize both are technically correct, but I suspect that empathetic got in there b/c the grammar gods threw in the towel.What does this have to do with Harry, you ask? Well, Ms. Rowling, who is not, as we all admit, the world's greatest writer while being a helluva story teller, constantly, constantly, constantly writes \"try and.\" This drives me insane. It's fine if she's writing dialogue since this is, in fact, what people say. But to write it as part of your story it should be \"try TO.\" Stupid, but I had to vent somewhere.Venting, mainly because I find writing about these books difficult. What is there left to say? Each one gets better and Prisoner of Azkaban is a huge leap beyond Chamber of Secrets (which is, as I've said before, almost the same book as Sorcerer's Stone). Love the development of the story, love Sirius, love Lupin, love how well Rowling can read and write about the teenaged mind. My 20th high school reunion is coming up and I'm not going for a million and one reasons, but it still has me thinking back to adolescence and pre-adolescence a lot, and she is right on the money. I only wish I could have gone somewhere as interesting as Hogwarts instead of the average American hellhole where I ended up. Wizarding thing aside, is it the boarding school aspect of it that seems so enticing? Can't tell.Another question about Harry's world, though, and I'm going to jump ahead to Goblet of Fire to ask it. Why can't the Weasleys use magic more to make their lives better? Mrs. Weasley gets entire meals to come out of her wand, so why can't Ron just fix up his dress robes or the hole in his bedspread? Why does his stuff have to be such rubbish? Hermione fixes an entire broken pane of glass on the train and he can't magic his clothes to be nicer? It seems inconsistent to me, although I'm sure if I cared enough, there are chatboards galore that would explore these same questions with me. I don't care that much.I also have, I must confess, the world's hugest crush on the film version of Lucius Malfoy. Love that blond wig! In the books, however, Bill Weasley just seems like the coolest guy going. Just wanted to share."},

I just really want Harry to be happy and I feel like he (and kind of his history/backstory) is given so much depth in POA. The connection between Harry and Sirius, and Harry finally finding a father figure in both Lupin and Sirius is really important to me, as well as them providing a framework for him being able to \"get to know\" his parents. I find the whole Marauder's story kind of tragic - with Lupin & Sirius losing their best friend (and, due to Peter's betrayal, 13 years worth of time with Harry) and so the huge focus of the marauders in this book just makes it an absolute favourite of mine. The ending of the book where Harry gets his letter from Sirius and reads it \"over and over\" and is just so happy makes me happy like bb you deserve all the happiness in the world I also think that the Quidditch matches in this book are some of the best in the whole series - the one where Gryffindor win the Quidditch Cup is THE BEST of the series, hands down. On top of that, we also see time travelling Hermione, Hagrid as a teacher, Hermione being a total badass (damn that hit on Malfoy tho) and breaking rules all over the place, HARRY GETTIN HIS FIREBOLT (a pivotal moment in the young kids life ok), Lupin actually being a good DATDA teacher, Harry & the sexual awakening (Cho Chang got him feeling things omfg ) the Boggart scene, Harry learning to cast a partonus !! Buckbeak !!, Hogsmede (and that damn perfect scene where Fudge talk about Sirius), Ron getting Pig, the Marauders Map, -- Fred & George study in this one ??? and an emotional chat between Dumbledore and Harry about his parents and his choices which was such a perfect conclusion to the book honestly. Also can we talk about how gloriously Harry's sass shows in this one because he was quippin all over the placeI love POA so much, I only wish it was longer ... "},

Even though I like, like one or two maybe of the Gryffindors, I mostly like the Slytherins. I don't know why, but you look in ghosts past, and you can see Harry's dad hurting and torturing Snape, and Snape has been good to Harry, and Harry still doesn't like him, and Snape was in Slytherin, so I just like Slytherin best.

I can't wait to read the next, 800-page books, which will hopefully last me more than a day.As usual, Dumbledore astonishes me with the pure magic that his brain and heart are, Hagrid makes me want to hug and pet him (in a completely non-sexual way), and I might have developed a slight tendency to daydream about a conflicted and lusty romance between Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, but that's one of the best parts of reading non-romance novels, right? You can imagine your own romance story.I swear, my heart is just about exploding right now, and I was pacing around the whole house during the last sixty pages.

Hermione has finally bitten off more than she can chew, and that along with her new pet and some tough choices she makes in an attempt to be a good friend, jeopardizes her relationship with both Harry and Ron, but particularly Ron. The two of them argue throughout most of the story like an old married couple, and when they finally make up, there were a couple of really cute moments. This just added fuel to the fire of my prediction that they will someday be more than friends. As always, all three of them acted very heroically, especially Harry and Hermione, and once again, Harry had the opportunity to show his amazing capacity for mercy, in this case to one who didn't really deserve it, which was a beautiful thing to me.I must say that I liked Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban the best so far.

Whichever, this is the novel where it gets serious. The hugeness of what happened and of what is yet to happen hits you. You can see all these elements appearing in your vision and you're just flabbergasted at what they could mean.Ultimately I think this series's success resides in the fact that Rowling has the power to make all of us feel wonder, whatever age we are.

This being that her protagonist Harry is a blank slate or rather an everyman. He's a passive character (occasionally active) who can appeal to almost reader. Does that give him much personality? Well personally I find him a rather boring character and am more interested in the side characters around him - characters who provide greater definition to Harry than anything else.That said I'm definitely moving on to the next book when I can. More to see the continuation of this story, finish the series and hope for greater improvement.

I enjoy how again we see the trio (Harry, Ron and Hermione) grow into such diverse individuals, the character development is just flawless throughout.When Harry returns to Hogwarts after blowing up his Aunt Marge, we discover a killer has escaped from Azkaban that we learn to have some relation to Harry. Throughout the book we're led to believe him to be someone who is a threat to Harry's life, but as the plot plans out not all is what it seems.Down to the trio making investigations of their own round Hogsmeade village under the invisibility cloak, they soon join the dots together and a surprise revelation is revealed.I think my favourite characters in this book were probably Hermione with her gadget- the time turner enabling her to attend every lesson available to third years, and Professor R.J Lupin who I found to develop into more of an uncle to Harry which must have been such a comfort. Having not known who is parents were personally, Lupin managed to fill in the gaps as to what his parents were like when they were Harry's age. I can't forget the twins Fred and George Weasley, cunning, funny, and handy in providing the Marauder's map that unlocks the knowledge of secrets within Hogwarts.I felt that this book in a way was a way for the reader to learn too, we discover new spells, potions and other various knowledge of the wizarding world as if we're students at Hogwarts too, and that's what makes this series such a wonderful experience to read!"},

I've always been a huge fan of the films. They're magical and gorgeous and everything I could ever want in a movie. I have the urge to watch the whole movie series every couple of weeks. To put it lightly, I'm obsessed. But, since I've watched the movies loads of times, I've put off reading the books. I always felt like I already knew all that was going to happen and that some of the joy would be taken out of reading the books. Well I was wrong. Especially with this one.This movie was actually my least favorite. I felt like it was where the film series started to get kind of confusing for those who hadn't yet read the books. This was the one film I didn't ever really watch all the way through. It just felt really slow paced compared to the other movies. And I admit, the book is like that as well. But there's just a certain beauty in the detail. I felt like I got to know the characters and the world much more. There were little things I'd missed in the movies. I found myself laughing and tearing up at certain parts. I just realized how much of a genius J.K. Rowling was in writing this series. It is perfect. And trust me, I don't ever say that lightly, or really often at all.I was definitely surprised. I think I'd actually rate the other two books four stars, if I believed in going back to change my rating. I wholly and utterly recommend. I can finally understand why these books are so special. I'll always remember my first time reading it forever."},

I don't think I'm capable of reviewing this one coherently without dissolving into a mess of feels. Update on the Ginny/Harry ship lookout I am apparently doing on this reread; Ginny isn't this particular book very much at all. But in the scene of their first encounter with a dementor, she is described as looking 'nearly as bad as Harry felt' and then it is said she starts sobbing. Knowing that dementors make you relive your worst memories and that their powers are especially effective on those with true horrors in their past; imagining Ginny being forced to relive her times being possessed and controlled by Riddle the previous year is just so terrifying and heartbreaking to think about. For a twelve year old to be forced to feel that again, it's no wonder she burst into tears. She and Harry both have horrifying memories of Voldemort, enough to bring them immense dread when a dementor is near. Yet another thing that would draw Harry to her; because she understands something about him that no one else does.~"},

Rowling is, there was so many threads to this story and you never felt lost, or felt like it's all over the place, she knew exactly what she was doing and by the end she wrapped everything up nicely and quiet brilliantly. it was a dark, whimsical, emotional journey, and i absolutely adored it. i can't even think how the next books are going to top that one?!

Anyway, I've been stuck in a little bit of a reading-rut; this usually happens about 4 times a year to be honest, and I've come to the realization that the only way I can get myself un-stuck is by rereading Harry Potter. I don't read the books in order, and sometimes I go back-and-forth between books reading the chapters I'm in the mood for. If I'm feeling annoyed I read \"The Prince's Tale\", if I'm feeling all sorts of self-loathing I'll go for \"The Mirror of Erised\", if I need my faith in humanity restored I'll opt for \"The Woes of Mrs. Weasley\". Regardless, when I'm going on a Harry Potter binge, I will always (and without fail) save the best (in my opinion) for last: The Prisoner of Azkaban. These books are like my babies, and although parents don't usually have a favourite child, this book has my heart in a way that none of the others do. It's a good thing I'm not a real parent because I'd be a totally shit one who chooses favourites. Why is this my favourite Harry Potter book? Perhaps because I have an unwavering love for the Marauders, especially Sirius Black. Perhaps it's because ole Voldy is blissfully absent. Perhaps it's because Harry, Ron, and Hermione are especially angsty with their bickering, which does a fantastic job of setting the foundation for a bomb ass friendship. Perhaps it's because the subjects are so entertaining, we have Hagrid taking over Care of Magical Creatures, Trelawney with Divination, and Lupin with Defense Against the Dark Arts. Perhaps it's because Snape gets attacked by the trio. More than likely, it's all of the above that contribute to making this book my favourite book of all time. I know that's high praise for a book labelled a children's story. I will personally fight anyone who taunts me. This series has my heart. I love it dearly. "},

I enjoyed every little bit of it!       \"I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.\"  The storyline of this book was absolutely brilliant! I have to say that I didn't remember a lot of things from the movie and therefore was very curious/surprised/shocked and whatnot else by specific twists. I liked everything about Hogsmeade,the Marauder's Map, Buckbeak, the Quidditch match and all the other fantastic elements - it was so interesting to read about all of it!Hermione is another important part of this book! While I liked Ron the most in the last one, I adored Hermione in this one! At times she seemed very lonely to me (mostly because of all the work and extra classes she had/wanted to do) and then there were these fights with Ron ... but well, she's always been there for them and supported her friends. I liked her loads and I'm sure that I'll like her even more in the next installments!      \"We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.\"  Sirius Black and Remus Lupin were my favorites though! I LOVED EVERY LITTLE SCENE WITH THEM! Seriously, I didn't remember a thing about Sirius (well, I remember that he wasn't bad in the movies), so I was super confused while reading about him. Remus was great and I liked him as teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts ... he's one of the teachers where I'd actually enjoy going to classes because he makes them seem interesting and fun! They're unique and there's always something new to learn - especially in a not-so-boring way!So, generally speaking, this was one absolutely brilliant book! I loved the ending and can't wait to continue with Goblet of Fire. I plan on reading it sometime soon ... wish me luck that I'll actually get to it then! :Dwww.aworldbetweenfoldedpages.blogspot.com"},

Because Camp NaNo has my brain fried, here are a few random tidbits that stood out.1) Professor Lupin, who I accidentally called Professor Lupus in the middle of a conversation with my friend. Love this guy, and he better come back into the series because awesome mentor figures are awesome.2) Loved the minor character development. Rowling knows how to keep each character in the fray; I definitely would not consider this a character-driven story, at least compared to other books outside of the science-fiction/fantasy genre, but she has a wide cast that she manages to develop with every installment. An example would be on page 149 when Professor McGonagall asks for the Hogsmeade permission forms and she informs Neville that his grandmother thought it would be safer if she sent it directly to the school.3) Ronmione. I sense I will ship them like no other in the future. The entire Crookshanks/Scabbers debacle as well as Ron's awkward pat on the head to Hermione has solidified my faith in this couple. Curious as to where the Harry/Cho Chang relationship will lead - maybe we'll finally see more of the houses other than Gryffindor.Looking forward to the fourth book! Also, here's an insanely intriguing blog post that determines your Harry Potter house based on your Myers-Briggs personality type. Where are my fellow Ravenclaw/Hufflepuffs?"},

Very, very well written. I believe you will grow to care deeply for them.Here Harry's relationship with his aunt and uncle (not to mention Dudley) becomes even more strained (yes I agree it seemed impossible, but there you are). Rushing off into the night Harry will soon be faced with certain changes and new challenges. He'll learn more about himself and start to learn things that will set him in good stead later in the story. Excellent books."},

And what I see tells me that only one character is good and great and heroic in the kind of goodness and greatness and heroism that interests me.I am not saying that Dumbledore's a bad guy. He's no Voldemort, obviously (although I am not entirely convinced that Voldemort is the embodiment of evil we often think of him as), and he leads the battle against Voldemort's fascist rise, which makes him the Churchillian leader of English myth. He does sacrifice himself. He does risk his health and welfare to destroy horcruxes. He does protect Harry (while moving the boy around like the chess piece that the boy is). But what strikes me is that everything Dumbledore accomplishes is accomplished to maintain the status quo, and the status quo I see is far from worthy of maintenance. It is a status quo with a classic English power structure, rich white guys at the top (Dumbledore anyone?) and everyone else beneath. It is a status quo with the usual class divides. It is a status quo with some pretty hefty racism (goblins and giants and other Others). It is a status quo with institutionalized slavery (and Dumbledore himself uses a small army of House Elves to run Hogwarts without a hint of distaste). It is a status quo with a prison system of torture. And Dumbledore does nothing to disrupt that status quo. In my opinion, the character who is the goodest of the good, the best of the best, the most heroic of the heroes is the one who rails against the status quo while simultaneously battling Voldemort, and she fights Mr. Riddle far more significantly than the rest of the wizarding world. And she fights the status quo in spite of being mocked for her beliefs by everyone at every turn. For me the paragon we should aspire to is Hermione Granger. Not Dumbledore and certainly not Harry Potter. So with that in mind, what's not to love about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It is the moment that Hermione comes into her own. She is the key to the resolution. She keeps them all alive. She's sceptical, she's smart, and she is potent. I love Hermione. Take that Hermione haters. "},

Rowling keeps the dark tone of the previous book going on, and it's fantastic! That sense of danger waiting in the corner that I became used to while reading The Chamber of Secrets is still there, so every new chapter is a new surprise.However, there are much more different things that go into this book that make it excellent. We are introduced to another Dursley, which, as usual, acts like a bitch. Then we get to know a little bit more about Harry's dark past and its influence into his current life situation. There are also the Dementors, which bring a whole new meaning to the word \"evil\". Seriously, those guys are creepy. Nonetheless, Harry is back at Hogwarts with his friends and soon he is taught how to confront the Dementors with the assistance of my favorite Defense Against Dark Arts teacher of all time: Professor Lupin.There is also the addition of a whole new scenario: Hogsmeade. Man, what I wouldn't give to go and visit that place... Due to Harry having to sneak his way into Hogsmeade we get to know some more about his father's activities while he was a student, as well as some new secret places in Hogwarts, which is really cool. What's more: Hermione starts taking some action against Draco and his troupe of sonsofbitches Slytherin friends, which is amazing to see. This book really made me respect Hermione a lot more.From the half of the book forward, the story gets a very fast pace, meaning that things get absurdly intense. There's a lot of action, much more than the previous books; boundaries are broken, secrets are revealed and Rowling forcs us to get used to the darker shade to the story that would come to be dominant in the next books, with the ascension of dark forces and everything. Overall, there's not a thing that I don't like in this book!  Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review:  The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed.  Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. We've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are."},

It's a great method of making the job seem not so big. I have read all the series before and the earlier volumes several times now, but I haven't read any since Deathly Hallows came out. It was getting time to revisit these great books and I found the most brilliant way.What can I say about the books that hasn't been said before? I have no idea. So I guess I'll just write a little about the audiobook experience and the minute details that I experience that I have forgotten in the books and were not part of the movies. There are a lot of them, especially the beginnings of each story at the Dursleys'. So even for a fan there is still an awful lot of detail that you have forgotten about. For example there is a lot of detail about Lupin in teh novels that is lost in the movies. And while the actor and the costume did a brilliant job in the movies, I feel that there was a slightly different Lupin to be found here. I think I liked him more.Stephen Fry does a wonderful job bringing the novels to life. He does all the voices, some better than others, and a mean Hagrid. Not literally, just spot-on. So I figure everyone is now either in a lover or a hater camp for Harry Potter. I'm not swaying anyone to read this. But for all those fans for who it has been a few years since reading, give it a go. It's time to revisit. And if you have an audible account or a local library with the audiobooks, experience it that way for a difference. "},

I love how much these characters develop as the books go on, and Remus and Sirius are some of my favorite characters. I feel like this is one I confuse with the movie a lot because I LOVE the PoA movie, so it was interesting to see some of the changes! Though it's a pretty faithful adaptation.

At this point in the series we are still looking at rather simple children's books, but the tone of the story is getting much darker and you can see the transition as the characters themselves get older and the threats grow.I liked the development of Hermione, which is something I'm looking at closely during this re-read. In the first two books she just seemed like the Token Girl, who giggled and cried and was scared and needed to be rescued (much like Ginny, who has perhaps replaced her), but in this third book she seems to have dropped that moniker somewhat. She's still not quite as I remember her, though.It was written better than the first two: you can clearly see various improvements, but it still doesn't seem to have the magic I was expecting. Not magic-magic (y'know, wooshy wands and all that) but the magic of the whole thing. I think the severe lack of world is really getting to me: the castle is fun, the Dursley's house is fun, the solitary trips to Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade are fun, but they're so small. So so small."},

And not just to surprise me, but to have laid all the foreshadowing so cleverly that I could have guessed the truth, but still did not. Maybe I was caught up in the story, in the action and laughter, the drama and worry. It's possible, but I highly doubt it. J.K. Rowling is a master story-teller - something that becomes more and more evident on re-reads.Even now, so many years later, having read the series (well, at least these first few books) a couple dozen times, I find things that surprise me and make me go: \"Oh! How haven't I caught that before?!\" The foreshadowing (for the entire series, including some revelations that shocked many in the end) is there.Khanh brilliantly states in her review that:This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.Harry realizes, probably for the first time, that those he always looked to for answers, to solve problems and right wrongs, aren't always able to. This is the book where Harry takes control, knowing fully that he's the only one that can do it.He grows up a lot in this book. And I can't help but feel badly for the little boy that deserved a much happier childhood. Still, Prisoner of Azkaban, and the series, isn't devoid of fun and humor - there's plenty here to balance out the growing darkness.Some of my favorite moments:1. Knight Bus2. Crookshanks - So much that I named my cat after Crookshanks3. Chocolate: \"Eat it. It'll help.\" - Yes, yes, it does.4. \"Oh, it's you, is it? I suppose you've been doing something dangerous again?\"5. Sir Cadogan6. \"You're going to suffer but be very happy...\"7. Professor Boggart Snape8. \"...page three-hundred and ninety-four...\" - 9. Marauder's Map10. Buckbeak11. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs - 12. *SLAP*Here comes my only complaint: I know this isn't a popular opinion, and perhaps people think I should be more forgiving, but I'm a Hufflepuff - loyalty is highly prized by me - and Ron can be an absolute ass. This is the first book where it's really driven home for me, but it's not the last.Oh, and no matter how good you think the movie is (and it's the first that takes real liberties with both the world and the story), the book is infinitely better. Mischief Managed.Previous thoughts:It's not possible for me to do a review for any of these books justice. I think I've finally come to that conclusion. I remember being absolutely awe-struck and blown away the first time I read this. Rowling threw a twist in there that I never saw coming (still one of the few books to pull one over on me), and on re-reads I always marvel at how completely she set me up for that twist. I should have seen it coming, but I didn't. That's just a small part of what makes this book my favorite in the series. It always has been. It always will be. "},

Harry, Ron and Hermione also do a lot more exploring of the Hogwarts castle and grounds in this book which is always fascinating to read about.

I am thinking of The Marauder's Map and the Time Turner. She also tidily answered questions that were raised within the book as well such as the Shrieking Shack and the names Padfoot, Moony, Wormtail, and Prongs. The story ending of course was left open so as to move on to the next installment, but that was expected. For me though, the ending of the story was great. Once I got to Chapter 19, I couldn't put the book down. My favorite part of the book was when Remus, Sirus, Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Snape are all in that Shrieking Shack, and you finally get to learn a lot of key information about Harry's past.

I just love the story too damn much to not be biased about it.Hermione is more badass than ever and she's stepping on evI swear I'll never stop saying this but THIS SERIES IS GENIUS. How can I love it more than I did before? It just blows my mind how everything is weaved together and how the characters and events are connected in ways the reader never expects. I must admit this book is probably my least favorite because it is slow for most of it as nothing concrete really happens but WHO CARES? I just love the story too damn much to not be biased about it.Hermione is more badass than ever and she's stepping on every rule ever and LOVES IT.Dumbledore is the most hilarious man ever because he is so wise and calm that when he plays people it just adds that much more to the action especially when he's driving Snape insane. I love that !! Especially since I don't like Snape very much. I know guys, I know everything! But I just can't love him despite everything.This took me waaay too long to read because... I wasn't reading lol. I probably spent 3 real days reading. Okay, so I'm done rambling now. ONTO THE GOBLET OF FIRE WE GO !"},

U+23E9I came into contact with the infectiously magical world of Harry Potter around the time the third movie installation of the series came out and the Time Turner is one of the earliest memories I have, in addition to the life-sized game of Chess that the trio played in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone and the name Tom Marvolo Riddle rearranging itself to form Lord Voldemort in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets. It was a long time ago, that Harry Potter has now come to symbolize a customary walk down memory lane and revisiting my childhood; even though this is my first time reading the books, seventeen odd years after the first one came out.U+23E9I was 13 years old when Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban movie hit the big screens. I didn't know what relation there was between the puny pet Scabbers and the buck-teethed man it morphed into- Peter Pettigrew. I watched with fascination the transmogrification of a rat into a man and many years later, here I am, learning the truth behind the act- animagus! And, Peter Pettigrew is, sure enough, disgusting to look at! Ew! U+23E9This book introduced many fun novelties like U+2705the Knight Bus, U+2705the Dementors, U+2705Professor Trelawney, U+2705the Boggarts, U+2705the Patronus, U+2705the amazing trio- Padfoot, Moony, Prongs(who wants anything to do with Wormtail?), U+2705the Marauder's Map(I am eternally grateful for the slogan   \"I solemnly swear that I am upto no good\") and U+2705the amazing man behind the steering wheel- Professor Lupin. U+23E9If you peruse through the chapter titles, you will find one major thing to be missing. Again that maybe because Rowling had thought that this person had the power to change the course of Harry's past: not in literal sense, though! The Grim. Padfoot. The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Godfather. (view spoiler)[Sirius Black. (hide spoiler)] U+23E9  Okay, I have an issue with Gary Oldman. His real blond hair from The Dark Knight series is a major turn-off for me. His shaggy black-haired character in the movie fades into background in a jiffy and is replaced by the powerful presence of the police commissioner of Gotham city. U+2757 U+2757All in all, this is the only book in the series where Mouldy ol' Voldy maintains a low profile.

{"rating": 4, "text": "4.5My favorite Harry Potter so far. The cast of characters and world really expanded in this one and there were some moments of brilliance. My one complaint was the pacing, as something great would happen and then there'd be long stretches of time without much plot development. I still don't feel like I'm aboard the HP fandom train but I think I might be getting there. Also psyched I finally know what the Marauders Map is."},

Honestly, if there ever was a flaw in the Harry Potter series, I'm very willing to overlook all of them and just sit back and enjoy the stories. For one thing, I did not care about Harry's Special Chosen One Syndrome and I'm not EVER going to, with good reasons.My heart really hurt (gross exaggeration, there) to revisit this book in the series where Sirius Black is first introduced to Harry Potter as a murderous-convict-turned-godfather. All those great chances Harry could have had with Black never happened and damn it, Rowling, that's still such a huge blow even after all this time."},

The map shows you the location of everyone on the Hogwarts grounds, a tremendously useful item, supplied, appropriately enough, by those masters of mischief, Fred and George.Another great new bit of magic in the book is the Patronus, a magical spell that will help fight back the dementors and fear, a very advanced piece of magic for third year students. There are many memorable scenes and events, and there's a lot more key information revealed about Harry's past.On to the next one! "},

As well as realizing, once again, that the movies definitely left a lot of awesome out of this story. And, in my opinion, this is where the series really start taking off for the more darker story-line which follows through the rest of the books.I don't wanna go into details in a super in-depth review, but would much rather pick up the next book and continue this re-read marathon Nika and I've got going. However, I have to say that Sirius Black and Remus Lupin (along with a James Potter, whom I wish both us readers as well as Harry would have gotten to know better) are some of my absolute favorite characters and I love the crazy start to their relationship with their best friend's son.Loved all of it. For the x-number of times. Brilliant.  'You think the dead we have loved ever truly leave us? You think that we don't recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trouble?

I just loved how this book felt like the true beginning to the plot, with the introduction of the Marauders and the more detailed account of Harry's past. This book was the first book where Harry and the crew felt like they were growing up. In books one and two, they were still very childish and young. But this book felt a lot like a loss of innocence in a way, and I really enjoyed that. Super excited to pick up the next book."},

I expected to be unimpressed, and I was was. The first two novels in the series are unspectacular. After reading more children's literature recently I've realized that they are fairly standard fair for the kiddie fantasy genre, but that still left me wondering why everyone cared so much about this little nerdling. If I hadn't engrossed myself in books for kids this summer I probably wouldn't have ever gotten decided to give Harry Potter another chance. I needed to figure out why, why was this series so popular? What makes this a huge cultural phenomena, while a book series like Percy Jackson is only a best-seller that adults don't jizz themselves over? Having read two of the PJ and HP, I decided I needed to investigate this a little more. It didn't hurt that I was bored last weekend and watched the second Harry Potter movie and found myself enjoying it and actually watched it all in one sitting, something I haven't done for a movie in months. Ok. Going into HP3 I was skeptical. I found the PJ's first two novels if not better than more interesting. They were about Greek mythology, and while silly at times they were a pretty fun take on all of the creatures and God's met in The Odyssey. I'll take stories involving Athena and Gorgons over Dumbledore and Voldemort any day. Strangely I was wrong about Harry Potter. I hate to admit when my prejudices are wrong, but apparently I am not infallible. While I still stand behind my judgment of books one and two being fairly fun but predictable and too episodic for my taste, book three seemed to move drastically beyond the almost cookie-cutter quality of Rowling's first two forays, and created a very full world that had enough depth to the characters and actions that I stopped feeling like I was being dragged along by the nose through an unengaging text. I don't know what to really say, except I really ended up enjoying it, enough so that I looked forward to starting book 4 (which I have started but have to say isn't living up to this book so far). When I was shamefully buying this book a cashier told me that this was her favorite in the series. Someone else stopped to tell me while I sat on the stoop behind work that it was their favorite too. I'm wondering if this is the pinnacle of the series, and that after this it just becomes a need to keep on reading, hoping that the heights of book 3 will be reached again, and feeling compelled to finish a series that one could feel very invested in. I don't know. As a side note, I had the thought that while I made fun of adults who loudly proclaimed their love for the HP books, especially around the time when the fourth one came out (this was the moment the little nerdling entered on to my myopic cultural radar, and I had my initial disgust at reading newspaper articles with adults saying they love the books and they aren't kids books, blah blah blah), I kind of get what they are saying. I don't agree with them, I don't think it's the greatest thing ever written, and I have lots of books I liked more than this one, but for a person who reads shitty books and lives on a diet of Grisham and Patterson with some other easy to digest cookie cutter adult novelists thrown in, this book would read like literature.

And yes, probably I don't grow with the characters like some of you but, I think that whoever you are: child, teenager or adult, these books will be part of your life forever and teach you many lessons of life. That's the magic of Harry Potter. I love the Marauders, I think Sirius and Remus are my favorite characters with Fred and George. (Please don't die!!) And can we talk about the places?

He escapes in a moment of rebellion - yay! take that, horrible Dursleys! - gets picked up by this bizarre wizard bus I wish we'd have for convenience, and then finds that all is not as it was in the world of wizardry. A dangerous criminal has escapes the prisons, and people are all aflutter, worried not only about his eventual plans to release the dark lord, but of his more immediate plans to get revenge on Harry.By now the characters have taken their footing in my heart, so I was almost as happy as Harry to reunite with Ron and the Weasly clan, Hermione and her ambitions, Hagrid and his animal woes, and the majestic Hogwarts that sounds like perhaps the best school ever invented. There's much familiar ground to retread - that annoying bully Malfoy and his overriding father, Snape and his sinister schooling, new experiments that sound as dangerous as they do educational...but also some new issues arises, namely wondering when Black will show his face and what will happen when that showdown finally strikes.It's frustrating a little to not see more of Voldemort yet (so much build up and I'm already eager for appearance), but the book delves further into the history of 'that night' when Harry's parents were viciously slaughtered. It was written well into the form of the dementer's eliciting memories in Harry's psyche, and there's a twist in the story that shows there's more to the legends and stories than previously known. As usual, misconceptions and half-truths for crimes.I do have to say the wizarding world loses a brownie point from me because of the dementers. They're awesome villains, creepy inventions that serve the story well, but it disturbs me prisoners are constantly tortured by them. The magical world is certainly not to be respected for having that occur at their awful prison.As I've said before, you'd think it would get dull going with the kids to a classroom of all things, but it stays fascinating. The lessons this time are perhaps the best of the first three - especially with another new Dark Arts professor, who shows nifty tricks tricks to Harry. Finally he seems to be learning some interesting things. This new professor is a welcome addition to the book; he plays a lot into the story, being easy to get attached to.Familiar focuses are brought clearer, like the Willow Tree and Invisibility Cloak, but we also get new goodies like that amusing Map, deeper journey into Diagon Alley, and of course Hogsmeade and it's delightful shops. Dumbledore has always been awesome, but he's even better here while he stands up for Hagrid and actually listens to Harry and others with sanity and reasonable instead of hilarity and prejudice.It was frustrating at the end when there was so much time people struggled to convince of a truth; it's a pet peeve when a main character won't listen for a second, or if someone is trying to tell the truth but isn't believed. I end up wanting to slap people around over that, but it's a small annoyance in the midst of greatness. There's a surprise at the end that I didn't see coming in the form of fur (I had suspected one surprise, the other I didn't.) The rescue of a surprising hero was also well done and crafted by Rowling, who has proven herself to be incredibly inventive.The series continues strong, getting better with each installment."},

I surprised myself by liking it.I enjoyed this book also. Rowling may not have the most elegant of prose styles, but she has a wealth of imagination and the ability to write a carefully plotted story with some well drawn characters in it. There's a nice mix of the magical and the mundane throughout the book. There are invisability cloaks and magical maps, but there are also essays to write, bullies and intimidating teachers to endure, and final exams to survive that help give children (and those of us who remember being children) things we can relate to.Events in this book also take a decidely darker and more adult turn as the story progresses and it does a good job of adding emotional depth to the back story. So I'm happy to admit that I made a mistake with this series and should have lined up at the book store with my nephew and nieces each time one of these books was published."},

As mentioned before, there's an ever present element of death in The Prisoner of Azkaban. Those ghoulish dementors are death itself. However, it also introduced a reason for Harry to want to live: his godfather, a connection to his parents. Up until then there was little joy in Harry's life. Sure there was the school, but that would end soon enough. Rowling did a smart thing when she introduced Sirius Black, she gave Harry a human bond and something to lose. As readers our attachment grew with his. That was when Harry became real to me. "},

He still has some of it left, but I know for sure he would never rise his voice to his uncles in the previous books, and in this one he's capable of defying them!2. I love Hagrid. Not in a I-want-to-marry-him way, but in the same way you love your grandfather. Whenever he appears, I just want to hug him! And his love for his weird creatures is just so cute! Gah!3. Remus Lupin is my newest book crush. This man is fantastic. I mean it. I love every bit of him. He's a great DADA teacher (the best one IMO), is brave and intelligent. He's not perfect, but that only makes him better. I could build an altar to him.4. Hermione Granger is a goddess. I'm not saying she's my favourite character, but I just love that she takes so seriously her study, and that she puts lots of effort in it. I'm a little like her in what my studies are concerned, so there's another reason why I liked her so much.5. Severus Snape... I have confused feelings about him. I don't hate him, but I don't love him either. I do admire his expertise in Potions. God, it's fantastic! I just love the fact that there's a character who is good at Chemistry (which we know is basically what Potions is). The sad part is that Snape is so horrible and unfair towards some students, and that annoys me. Oh well, we shall see.6. I want a Time-Turner so I can study and read at the same time. It could be useful for other things, but imagine if I could do both of those things without compromising my grades! Too good to be true, actually.7. (view spoiler)[I feel terribly bad for Sirius Black. Locked in Azkaban (possibly the worst prison in existence) during 12 years... and worse even, he was innocent. It makes me even more sad that his only hope for finally getting free (handing Pettigrew) turned out to be shallow because the man escaped. Sigh. (hide spoiler)]8. (view spoiler)[I despise Peter Pettigrew. Seriously, he makes me sick. That sorry excuse of a man is the biggest coward I've ever met in books, and I just hate cowardice... and I hate betrayal even more. Oh, damn him! Please rot in Hell, Wormtail. Or if there's something worse than Hell, let that be your place. (hide spoiler)]9. I love Fred and George and the Marauder's Map and mischief managed! They're just so funny, and the map is so useful and you have to admit the words you have to say to make it work are the best thing.10. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the first book in the HP series that truly deserves the five stars. Yeah, I gave books 1 and 2 the same rating as this one, but this is the one that screams five starts from beginning to end. It's more mature than the previous one, the plot is better, charcters are more developed, etc. I think this was the book that settled my love for HP. I wasn't sure I loved it before this re-read, but now? I've got no doubt.So there you have my 10 things. Now I'll continue my re-read with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

For example, Hermione took on too much work, and she gradually started to go crazy (and consequently distanced herself from her friends, became more moody, and then finally just bitch-slapped Malfoy). I also found Oliver Wood to be hilarious in this book for similar reasons: this was his last year at Hogwarts, and he wanted nothing more than to win the Quidditch Cup so he could have some sort of glory at Hogwarts, and he became so consumed by it (as I'm sure lots of people on sports teams do). The way he was so emotionally invested really cracked me up but also felt so real. Side note: CEDRIC IS SO DAMN NICE. when he realized that Harry fell off his broom during the Quidditch game and Hufflepuff won he called for a rematch, which says a lot about him, and it just makes what happens in the next book that much worse.But of course, all of the Marauders stuff made my inner fangirl go nuts because it has to be my favorite Harry Potter storyline.

Notice that I used the past tense.Obviously, there will be spoilers for the book below, for the 1.5 of you who haven't read this yet.I can't even recall why this book wasn't memorable to me. All I remembered was that Sirius - and what happened to him - was terrible, but he's like meh to me; I just never connected with him as a character. Remus was a werewolf and I've never liked werewolves. The Marauders in general were just a bunch of rowdy teenaged boys, and having been the target for teasing from rowdy, rude teenaged boys in my youth, I just didn't care for the way they were portrayed. And I was right, somewhat, James, et al weren't perfect. They bullied Snape, they were little shitheads. Yes, eventually they became productive, admirable members of society, but I just didn't like them at first.I guess this is one of those books that just takes time to grow on you.This is the last Harry Potter book in which Harry is a child. Before his life - and this series - was visited by the spectre of death. I'm not talking about the long-ago deaths of James and Lily, of course Harry has experienced deaths before, but it was distant. I'm talking about the future deaths where Harry lost people he actually remembered, and respected, and loved. That's what I mean when I say that this is the last book in which Harry is a child, because as hard as his life was until now, he still had his innocence.Children believe that their heroes are unerring. One of the rites of passage to adulthood is the realization that heroes fall, like everyone else.  Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground beneath him was falling sharply away. He had grown used to the idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But no U+2026 their last hope was gone.I know that everyone loves Sirius, but for some reason, he didn't click for me when I was 14. This time around, I could understand his character more. I could relate to his desperation, his frustration, and the hope that kept him alive all those excruciating years in Azkaban.  U+2018I donU+2019t know how I did it,U+2019 he said slowly. U+2018I think the only reason I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasnU+2019t a happy thought, so the Dementors couldnU+2019t suck it out of me U+2026 but it kept me sane.I think for me, it took maturity and the experience of loss and frustration, well, life itself, in order to appreciate the hardship that Harry and Sirius and Remus went through.

For this review, I will be writing as Crookshanks fan fiction.Crookshanks swished his tail back and forth as he crept up the stairs to the boys' bedrooms. He knew the rat wasn't what it was pretending to be, but all of his attempts to alert the humans to this fact had failed. \"I don't know why I even bother,\" he muttered to himself. \"I could get along fine without any of them. Let the rat do whatever it is it's trying to do. So long as Girl keeps feeding me and scratching my belly, I'll - hello, what's this?\"He could smell the rat. Its scent was like nothing Crookshanks had ever smelled, and for all his time living in a magical pet shop, he'd smelled a lot. The rat did smell like a rat, yes, but there was also something else. Something... human. It was just like that big black dog he'd met on the grounds the other day. Every instinct in him had screamed to run away, but there was that smell. And even Crookshanks knew what they said about cats and curiosity. The dog had turned out to be more than just a dog, and it had convinced Crookshanks to help it. First order of business: retrieve a certain rat from the bedroom of the Red-Haired Boy.The Boy wasn't in, but the rat was. Crookshanks circled the bed a few times. This time, maybe, he would be able to get the damn thing. He tensed for a moment and then leapt onto the bed.By luck or skill, he was nearly on top of the thing when he landed. \"A-HA!\" he yowled. \"Gotcha!\" He pinned the rat under his sizable paw. \"Where you gonna run to now, ratty?\" he asked, sneering as best he could.The rat writhed in his grip. \"Please,\" it said. \"Just let me go. You don't know what will happen if you eat me, it would be a terrible mistake!\"\"A mistake, eh?\" the cat said. \"We'll see about that. I have a great big doggie friend who's just aching to get his jaws around you....\"He barely had time to finish his sentence when the rat went mad. It squealed and bit and slashed with its paws. And then, against all of Crookshanks' previous experience - it grew! It nearly threw the cat off the bed as it became much more massive - its legs lengthened and its arms stretched until it had reached a human size and shape. Crookshanks goggled. Of all the things he'd expected from this rat, this wasn't it. The human grabbed at him, but Crookshanks was too fast. He jumped off the bed and shimmied under the wardrobe, where he could see but not be seen.The human looked around, breathing heavily. He was pale and thin, and still looked ratty. \"Think, Peter, think,\" he said. \"Gotta get out of here, but...\" He stopped, glanced at the wardrobe, and grimaced. \"You may just have given me my way out, cat,\" he said. And then he bit the ball of his hand.Blood dripped out, leaving spreading red blotches on the sheets. \"They'll think it was you,\" he said. \"They'll leave me for dead and I'll be free to rejoin my Lord.\" He looked at the recently repaired curtains on Ron's bed. \"It's not safe here anymore.\" He sucked at the wound to stop the bloodflow and then went to the window. Perched on the windowsill, he looked over at Crookshanks' hiding place. \"If I were human,\" he said, \"the fall would kill me. But as a rat....\" His body rippled and twisted and shrank, and then there was an old grey rat on the sill. Crookshanks was pretty sure it winked at him before leaping off.After a minute or two, Crookshanks wriggled out from under the wardrobe, his thoughts dark. The Red-Haired Boy was going to be angry, and so was the Girl. But more importantly, the Dog was going to be furious. It was barely holding on to its sanity as it was. Crookshanks shook his head. This was going to get worse before it would get better..."},

I did not know, Mother Rowling. Forgive my sin, and all the times whLiterally one of the best books I've ever read. I was chained to it for two days. I cried and laughed and yelled SHIT when all of the action went down.I'm such a peasant for judging this series before I had read it. I read the first two and half of this one when I was about 10, before reading was cool, before I had the attention span that reading requires (I know these are kids' books but I was a particularly distracted child). I did not know, Mother Rowling. Forgive my sin, and all the times when I said, \"I don't think Harry Potter is really my thing\". Please.This book was incredible and this series is a classic more than any Dickens or Middle Earth or Narnia shit has any right to be. This series isn't up it's own ass; it's so accessible and readable and meaningful.God damn me! How could I have been so blind?Forgive me, because this book changed the game. This book deserves 7 stars and I'm getting the cover art (from my edition) tattooed on my thigh.I'm such a fucking fan."},

This must have been at least the 10th time I've read it but I have lost track. The theme I can take out of this particular book especially after reading it all these times is hope. Harry largely naive for most of the first three books, meets Sirius for the first time and his world changes. For ever so briefly he thinks he can leave the Dursleys for good and live entirely in the wizarding world. OfHarry Potter for me is like warm apple pie and vanilla ice cream.

Harry largely naive for most of the first three books, meets Sirius for the first time and his world changes. For ever so briefly he thinks he can leave the Dursleys for good and live entirely in the wizarding world. Of course, we know what happens next ;). The last 100 pages of this book for me are my favorite 100 pages of the series aside maybe from the end of Deathly Hallows, especially because (in my opinion) I feel the movie most closely resembles the book. This is usually the time of year when I reread the septology, and I am looking forward to feeling magical again as though it's my first time reading these books. Like that slice of warm apple pie, I am comforted knowing that for a few hours I can enter Harry's world. "},

Last seen running along side the Knight Bus with Harry Potter's invisible cloak. Also Suspected in the kidnapping of fellow Goodreader Jeff and best-selling author Stephen King. Blonde Hair...big green doll eyes, has a frightening maniacal cackle and a tendency to whine when she doesn't get her way. LOUDLY. Considered armed and dangerous- approach with caution...and Nerds- she likes Nerds.Now back to our regularly scheduled review....I don't listen to a lot of audio-books (I prefer to read) but I was kind of falling behind in my reading commitments...and I had put Ms. Stepheny off again and again for this buddy-read soooooo many times- I couldn't do it again to her (she pouts..and she gets all mopey and it is JUST heartbreaking). I am so happy I listened to this one- Stephen Fry was just perfect. Perfect!..and HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN was just the thing to put me in the Christmas Spirit. It's Harry's least favorite time of year- school break spent with the Dursleys...and this visit isn't going well. First: News that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban- Second: An unfortunate accident involving mean Aunt Marge...Harry decides not to stick around- and catches the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley- where instead of getting in trouble for using magic away from Hogwarts, he gets invited to stay until school begins, by Cornelius Fudge-the Minister for Magic.The night before he is expected to leave- Harry is warned that Sirius may have escaped with murder in mind- and HE may be the target....This is my favorite of the series so far!! I loved that it was still light and fun...but that the darkness is slooooooooowly creeping in.I loved that a lot of it took place during the Christmas Holidays...I really liked the addition of the Dementors...spoooooky......and I adored Buckbeak!!As for the whereabouts of Stepheny? I can almost guarantee...she is up to no good."},

I never would've learned any of this if I never decided to pick up these books.This series just gets better and better, and darker and darker. I can slowly see how Harry Potter is moving away from middle grade and into young adult. I'm really looking forward to how that shift becomes more prominent in the later books. Now next up is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite movie of the series growing up! Let's see how this one will go!"},

He stays at his uncle's and aunt's house like he usually does for the whole summer. But this year is different, he can not control his anger anymore and he leaves his uncle's and aunt's house. There is also a man named Sirius Black, Mass-Murderer and follower of Lord Voldemort escaped from Azkaban. Most prisoners go mad withins weeks in Azkaban but this man doesn't and people say that he is coming after Harry and in Harry's first divination class, Professor Trelawney sees an omen of death in Harry's tea leaves and now, the school grounds are being Patrolled by DEMENTORS.My Opinion The cover of this book is so BEAUTIFUL! and the story was as amazing as the cover.I also found a new favorite character in this book and this person is Professor Lupin!! He is so cool and he is the best Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher I have ever met. because you know, all the Defence Against The Dark Arts teachers from the first book were not nice guys at all including that guy with useless ability. What's his name again?? LOCHART! GILDEROY LOCHART. I just remembered his name. Actually, where is he now? no one mentioned him and I hope I won't see him as a teacher in Hogwarts again. I still can't forgive him for what he was about to do with Ron and Harry in the second book. That guy is pathetic.I loved all the characters in this book and Fred and George weasley were so funny in this book. Percy is the last person I like. I don't hate him but I don't really like him too. He's so stritch about rules and sometimes he annoys me but not much. here is my favorite scene : 'How're we getting to King's Cross tomorrow, Dad?' asked Fred, as they tucked into a sumptuous chocolate pudding.'The Ministry's providing a couple of cars,' said Mr Weasley.  everyone looked up at him.'Why?' said Percy curiously.'it's because of you, Perce,' said George seriously. 'And there'll be little flags on the bonnets, with HB on them -''- for humungous Bighead,' said Fred. Everyone except Percy and Mrs Weasley snorted into their pudding. I laughed so hard in the middle of the night because of this. I wish I were there to see Percy's face when Fred and George said that. Oh! and I remembered I laughed so hard too when Ginny said he found out that Percy was kissing Penelope Clearwater, his girlfriend. I mean Percy is so stritch about rules and he always study, study, study, so the thought of Percy's having a girlfriend was never crossed my mind. But he was cool enough to get a girlfriend. *shrugs*I was so shocked when I found out that Sirius was innocent and the bad guy was Peter Pettigrew. how could he betray his own bestfriend?! I think he did it to save his own skin without thinking twice about his bestfriend's life. James and Lily Potter died because of him and how dare he to say that Sirius was the one who betrayed James Potter! this guy is more pathetic than Gilderoy and I was shocked when Harry told Lupin and Sirius not to kill him and put him in Azkaban instead. That moment I realised that Harry was so kind. this guy was the reason his parents died and he didn't want him to be killed. This book also have the best ending. the ending in this book made me grinning but don't get me wrong, the ending in the first and the second book were all great too but this ending was perfect. 'What's that?' he snarled, staring at the envelope Harry was still clutching in his hand. 'if it's another form for me to sign, you've got another -' 'it's not,' said Harry cheerfully. ' it's a letter from my godfather.' 'Godfather?' spluttered Uncle Vernon. 'you haven't got a godfather!.''Yes I hav,' said Harry brightly. 'He was my mum and dad's best friend. He's a convicted murderer, but he's broken out of wizard prison and he's on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, though... keep up with my news... check I'm happy...'And grinning broadly at the look of horror on Uncle Vernon's face, Harry set off towards the station exit, Hedwig rattling along in front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than the last.

This is the one that introduces Sirius Black, who I sometimes loathe (only sometimes!) and Remus Lupin, who I will always, always love. And of course, this is the book that gave us one piece of Severus Snape's background. And that was the infamous Prank that may or may not have destroyed Snape's trust in Dumbledore. Would you have trusted someone who didn't at least suspend the one who'd tried to kill you? I don't think so. This is also the book where I found myself looking at Dumbledore with a new eye. He's a crafty old fella, I tell you that. He'll do anything to gain his means, regardless of how he may personally feel on the matter. Grandpa Albus, he ain't.

Yes, I am that generation. I was a little bit younger than 11 when the books were released, and when the final book was published I had just graduated high school. I'm also the same age as Daniel Radcliffe and he's only older than me by less than a month. I also have a deathly hallows bumper sticker on my car. So, I think it's safe to say that this series has had a profound effect on me, to the point where I am still a little bit bitter that I never got my Hogwarts acceptance letter.A couple years ago I reread the first two books in the series and loved them just as much as when I was a kid. So when I got into a horrible reading slump, I saw my dad watching Harry Potter weekend on ABC Family (as he does for every fucking Harry Potter weekend mind you), I said to myself, what the hell. Time for a reread. So hence, Harry Potter 3 reread. All of us may know the story but I am going to reiterate. In his third year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter learns that a dangerous man named Sirius Black has escaped from the wizard prison Azkaban. Harry then overhears the fact that Black is the reason his parents are dead, as Black sold them out to Voldemort and then killed 13 people in broad daylight.  So in a unique part of the review from me, here are all the amazing parts of this book that I forgot because I've been watching the movies instead: -Peeves the Poltergeist: Holy crap how did I forget about this hilarious menacing spirit? He's not as present in this book but he has always had a part in the series and I completely forgot he existed! I know they can't include everything in the movies but I wish Peeves had been included.-Charlie Weasley: Ron had yet ANOTHER sibling that is only mentioned in the films! This one is the cool brother in Egypt.-Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory: there are soooooo many mentions of Cho and Cedric in this book! I never really noticed Cedric until the 4th book where he becomes prominent. And this is the book where Harry's crush on Cho began. Stomach flutters!-More details on Whomping Willow/Shrieking Shack: This may be a spoiler for those of you who haven't read it, but the Whomping Willow was actually planted to hide Lupin's werewolfism as well as the shrieking shack to hide him. I thought this little tidbit was super interesting, along with the details of how Black escaped Azkaban. And just in general, I love JK Rowling's ability to tie things together. There's so much in this book that becomes important later and tiny little details and sharp wit that make me giggle. So in a small factoid, this book is probably my least favorite of the entire series. It's good, obviously, but for some reason I like all the other ones better. The movie, well it's my second to last favorite (just ahead of that godawful Goblet of Fire film which ruined everything but I digress). The movie director added so many unnecessary things that weren't in the book, and I wish he hadn't so he could of kept the good stuff! (And I've heard a rumor that he didn't even read the fucking book until JK kept vetoing all of his weird ideas. Look it up!)If you haven't read these books, do not tell me!!!!! I will smack you!"},

Thus, Prisoner of Azkaban carries a hefty helping of something so terribly thrilling, it nearly pains me to think that too many adults view these as children's books, because Jo dove headfirst into the Gringotts vault and crafted, what? A SPY THRILLER???Hah! Expecto Patronum!Hitchockian to the last word, Jo uses her mastery of psychology to create a false villain in Sirius Black, deepening the story to masterful levels with her careful use of incredibly dangerous ingredients, such as the Marauder's Map and the Time Turner.

Double-crosses and old secrets, misunderstood wizards and life-changing choices on full display under the waxy silver light of a full moon, who is it that saves the day?Expecto Patronum!That's right. Just look at that cover. Because this book is about perception and reality, and about the destiny of realizing what is true within and letting it out.Dementors be damned, this book is Siriusly amazing.Recommended for everyone."},

Is it possible to find a modern educated person with even passing interest in literature who never read the books and never saw the movies? However I already wrote the previous paragraph, so I am not going to erase it.This is the first book of the series which made me realize that we are not in Kansas anymore - to quote another children classic (yes, I call Harry Potter a children classic series). This is the place where the series leave comfortable and fluffy status of simple children books and slowly crosses in to an adult territory. I would call it young adult, but the modern understanding of the term demands a presence of heartbreaking romance and Harry Potter does not fit. To make a long story short do not expect a happy ending here, but do expect some quite dark moments.I thought about reducing the otherwise perfect rating by one star because of some minor inconsistencies and the whole Time Turner thingy. I would not call the latter Deux Ex Machina as it did not come up from nowhere, but it was way too convenient for the final resolution for me. The fact that it completely disappears from the series never again to be heard about does not help any. Still this was not big enough annoyance for the lower rating, so the 5 stars remain. So the book is very much worth reading - as if I need to say it. I had exactly the same amount of fun rereading the book as I had during my first read; knowing what would happen next had not diminish my enjoyment any. "},

I was just reading and reading and reading like a junkie addicted to their drug, that was my brand of heroine for sure..I loved Sirius and I loved Remus. I loved everything about this. I love the relationship between Harry, Ron & Hermione. They all fit together, they need no one else. It's just them three and it's enough because they know that they'll always have together, and no matter what they'll stick together because that's what friends are for. And being different people, having diffent personalities doesn't bring us apart, it brings people together. It makes the friendship more interesting, more unpredictable.

The first book was fantastic, although I read it probably ten years too late in my life. The second book was not so fantastic, but still a great book. And the third one ... completely blew my mind.I wanted to write a review on this book; I even started a checklist to keep track of what I wanted to add here. But the further I delved into the stories about the Prisoner of Azkaban, the more did I realize that the only things I was going to say were 'X is awesome', 'Y rocks' and 'Z simply has to be the winner'. The only aspect which might be criticized about this book might be the fact that some characters like Voldemort, Malfoy or, on the other hand, Harry, Hermione or Ron are relatively black or white, evil or good. But I don't mind. Because. Those. Characters. Are. Amazing. Hagrid and Lupin are my new favorites after reading this book. And I want more of Hedwig, because - owls!In contrast to the two previous books, the pace is so wonderfully matching in this book. Just at the right time before the descriptions of the Hogwarts school year (all of them contributing to the entire plot) might turn too extensive, the story climbs up to its climax and concludes within one hundred pages of incredible tension. Logical relevations, long-desired confrontations and a lot of surprises will accompany you during your journey with Harry and his friends, resulting in the convergence of several different plotlines which were established during the course of the novel.Most of the people I know have read this book, but if you happen to be one of the few exceptions, then go read it. Maybe you fear it because of its fantasy elements? I've never been a fan of fantasy either, but this book series changed my opinion. Maybe you fear it because of its popularity? Don't be afraid. The hype is completely justified.My reviews in the Harry Potter series:1) Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone: Go to review2) Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: Go to review"},

Even as far as the movies go, I feel that PoA is by far the best book to film adaptation out of all 8 movies. Yes Harry Potter and Ron and Hermione are still fairly young in the third book, but I find they have matured quite a bit this time around. They're officially in their teens, and they've already had their fair share of adventures. This time around however, Harry has more to worry about than just Voldemort (as if that wasn't already enough). Harry's Summer vacation at the Dursley's take a turn for the worse when Uncle Vernon's vile sister Marge comes to visit. She is completely horrible to Harry, and by comparison makes his Aunt & Uncle look almost human. After a disastrous visit ends abruptly (lol) Harry finds himself spending his last two weeks of Summer vacation in Diagon Alley. I always feel so happy about Harry being able to soak in his magical surroundings and do as he pleases...I mean how fun would it be to hang out in Diagon Alley?!The writing here is above reproach. I read somewhere that J.K. Rowling said that when she had finished writing Half Blood Prince, she hadn't been that satisfied with a book since The Prisoner of Azkaban, and I think it shows: this is Rowling at her best. There are so many new magical elements added in the mix this time : The Maurauder's Map, the discovery of the identity of the Maurauders themselves, the Dementors are absolute nightmares (view spoiler)[ I've always found it incredibly telling of Harry that his Boggart is NOT Voldemort, but a Dementor. Like Lupin says, Harry's worst fear, is fear itself. And Lupin is right; it is really brave U+2665  (hide spoiler)] , the Patronus charms are really cool, and always have me imagining what I think my own Patronus would be. I also really enjoy the visits the the wizarding village of Hogsmeade, the only all wizard settlement in London.(view spoiler)[ Now as for a few of the best elements of Prisoner of Azkaban: Remus Lupin & Sirius Black. Lupin is the first competent Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher we've ever been introduced to. But as a character, he's quite tragic but I just adore him. He's kind and capable and his bond with Harry is truly special. He happens to have the same birthday as me though and that's pretty cool :) And after reading the book thinking one thing about Sirius Black, finding out the truth is staggering, and wonderful all at once. Sirius is and always will be one of my favorite characters in the series and meeting him the way we do is a treat, even without the mystery involved the first time around. Also? The 30 minutes Harry believes he'll be able to move in with Sirius...*sigh* and have something close to a home...and a family. Again it's tragic but beautiful.  (hide spoiler)]As usual, the book ends with the requisite Dumbledore & Harry heart to heart. And Dumbledore always contributes a hint at a key plot element that will come to play again later on in the story. (view spoiler)[ There will come a time when Harry is grateful he saved Pettigrew's life...  (hide spoiler)] Upon rereading you really get to savour that expert foreshadowing. It's brilliant to see how it all fits together in the end...every little detail is woven into the plot for a reason. Not many authors can ever dream of accomplishing such a feat, but J.K. Rowling does it seamlessly.The Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my absolute favorite books in the world. From the very first sentence where Rowling re-introduces us to our beloved hero by telling us how strange he is, I was, and still am in love. I adore the tone, the new characters and how Harry and co. have obviously matured and grown so much already. The feels are strong for this one...U+2665[ I've always found it incredibly telling of Harry that his Boggart is NOT Voldemort, but a Dementor. Like Lupin says, Harry's worst fear, is fear itself.

Many state that it is too much like the first one and that it doesn't serve much purpose. I tend to give people a heads up that the first 3 books of the series in general are aimed at a much younger crowd than the last 4. I have to say I was shocked but very excited to see that once again, Delee had given  5 shiny stars to Chamber as well. So here we are. Our journey began in March of 2014 and I have been trying my best to be a patient and understanding leader. Sometimes I take her hand and gently guide her, other times I chase her with a wooden spoon threatening severe punishments if she doesn't commit to a date to begin the next book. But I do try to be patient. I hope she knows that. ;) We picked up another buddy for this read-  The Enchanting Ivonne. When it comes to the world of Harry Potter there is little that I am unfamiliar with. And there is even less that I wonU+2019t do to get people to read it. Now that Delee has the third book under her belt I think it will take less and less persuasion to get her on board for the next one. In fact, we finished this one in December and weU+2019re starting Goblet in March! MARCH. ThatU+2019s not that far away! Prisoner has been a fan favorite since it came out. I think it was one of the most popular of the movies as well. But it has never been my favorite. Obviously I still love it and itU+2019s a wonderful book, but in the grand scheme of things it falls lower on my list than most other PottheadsU+2019. A crazy murdering psycho is on the loose. His name is Sirius Black and he has somehow escaped the Wizard prison- Azkaban. No one, and I do mean no one, has ever done this before. Now, this isn't some wimpy old Muggle prison like Alcatraz.We are talking the big time here folks. The place is packed with dementors! They suck the happiness and life right out of you. They make you so incredibly sad and sorrowful that youU+2019ll be left with no hope.So how did Black do it? How was he able to remain sane in a place as awful as Azkaban? They say he was lucid and even downright chatty whenever the Minister for Magic had to do a check on the prison. Is he just that crazy that the dementors donU+2019t affect him? Most importantly- why did he escape? But Harry soon finds out that Black has come to finish what he started 12 years earlier. He has come to kill Harry.Prisoner offers a break in what was perceived as the U+201CFormulaU+201D. In this one we learn to battle our depression. We learn to find our happiest moments in our weakest and most awful ones. We learn to forgive and we learn to show mercy. We learn what it means to have a second chance. And we are introduced to Buckbeak. Prisoner of Azkaban is a great story and added a nice dynamic to the Harry Potter series. It is the only one like it within the series where the other ones can be compared fairly easily to one another. I am so thankful to have such an incredible friend agree to accompany me on this journey. I am so thankful that she trusts me to guide her. But mostly I am so thankful that we can share these stories together. It is a bonding experience like no other. "},

It was clear that the hormones were finally kicking in because they had many arguments in this novel. Ron and Hermione in particular often got on each other's nerves for reasons both shallow and significant. As for Harry, I was grinning from ear to ear when he had finally met a girl that made his stomach drop in the best possible way.

And if I must say so, my admiration for Hermione grows stronger by the book.Honestly, I probably enjoyed this book so much also because I watched the movie adaptation beforehand (4/5 times). It was nearly effortless for me to imagine all the intriguing events that were happening, which was practically a huge bonus to my reading experience. Furthermore, I was actually delighted to spot the differences between the movie and book; although I already knew the story by heart through the movie, I still experienced moments of blissful enlightenment.

But here, she walk out of Divination class. Not that I approved her insulting Professor Trelawney. It's just that a high IQ person like Hermione doesn't rely on predictions. So it makes sense Hermione acted that way. 2. Professor Remus LupinOf all the teacher of Defence Against the Dark Arts, Professor Lupin is the best Hogwarts and its students had ever had. Everybody, except the Slytherin and Snape of course, loves him. He's kind and tolerant with the students. And it makes Gilderoy Lockhart unbearably ridiculous. Yes. RIDICULOUS. 3.

Plus, there were Moaning Myrtle and Aragog. They both added to the frightening moment of my reading experience. Sorry, Dementor. You can now suck my happiness out of me. Wooooo. But then I have to kill you haha.4. Buckbeak vs FawkesWell, I can't choose between these two birds. Both of them have their own appeal. Buckbeak is so cute and funny while he's a big creature. And Fawkes is so wise and affectionate just like Dumbledore. They both strong and loyal. One thing differentiates them is that Fawkes's teardrops can heal wound while Buckbeak's can't. So, I think Fawkes wins.Now I can't wait to read the fourth book!!! YEAY!!!"},

I watched the movies of some of the books years ago and I liked them but these books! I want to run outside and scream READ THESE BOOKS! But then I think I'm one of the last people in the universe that hasn't. So I'll be sorta quiet. P.S. Read these books! "},

(The French for wolf being loup.) ItU+2019s these little treats that appeal to adults reading this series. Rowling nails the angst of school, too, with the dread of being mocked by oneU+2019s peers, the fixation on who wins what game, the anxiety about test scores, the rows with friends, and doubting oneU+2019s abilities. These are the worries of childhood which morph into our adult problems. Everyone can identify. And the teachers! As Robertson Davies wrote in Fifth Business, U+201CIf a boy can't have a good teacher, give him a psychological cripple or an exotic failure to cope with; don't just give him a bad, dull teacher. This is where the private schools score over state-run schools; they can accommodate a few cultured madmen on the staff without having to offer explanations.U+201D I personally sometimes learned interesting life lessons from the teachers who hated teaching or who were on the brink of a nervous breakdown. They may not have been the best at teaching chemistry or English or whatever, but I learned to cope with people who had power over my life and who were not having a good time.Read as part of my Halloween Book Bingo 2016, to count towards the Witches square."},
