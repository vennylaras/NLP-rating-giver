Don\u2019t read this if you haven\u2019t read the Harry Potter series and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child yet!-------------------------------------If you loved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I wouldn\u2019t recommend reading my review. This is going to be a rant! You\u2019ve been warned!-------------------------------------This is the very first time I have rated a book one stars! Believe me, I don\u2019t want to do this, but I really didn\u2019t enjoy reading Cursed Child. Before I get started, I want you to know the following: 1. A couple of weeks ago, I read some spoilers from people who had watched the play. Those immediately lowered my expectations. I knew going into this I wasn\u2019t going to like it. 2. I knew this was not written by J.K. Rowling. 3. I knew this wasn\u2019t the eight book, but the script for the play.I love the Harry Potter series so much. And I always will. It means a lot to me and when I heard about this, I immediately pre-ordered it. I\u2019ve seen some people say \u2018it\u2019s Harry Potter so obviously I love this\u2019, but I can\u2019t say the same. Call me critical but I spent money on this. People spend money on tickets to go see the play. I expect something decent in return then.To call this fanfiction is an insult to all the people who try to bring more joy to a fandom. The Cursed Child was just plain bad writing. I will get into detail later, but I refuse to accept what happened as canon. I don\u2019t care what J.K. Rowling says. This is a disgrace to the characters and the people who loved the original book series. You might think that I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but they shouldn\u2019t ask money for this if it were \u2018just for fun\u2019. This is literally being promoted as \u2018the eight story\u2019 in the Harry Potter series. I knew before I started it that it wasn\u2019t, but the marketing team pretends it is.So no, I won\u2019t apologise for being critical. Just because this isn\u2019t a book, but a play, doesn\u2019t mean that the story shouldn\u2019t be as good. In fact, that is such an insult to plays! It\u2019s just another form of media. I\u2019ve seen some people say: \u201cYou can\u2019t judge this if you haven\u2019t seen the play\u201d. Well, if that\u2019s the case, they shouldn\u2019t have published it as a book. I can\u2019t afford going to London and paying a lot of money in order for some people to validate my opinion.Let\u2019s start of with the things I did like:This felt as if I was reading a book. It didn\u2019t take time to adjust to the format. I\u2019m also curious to see what everything is going to look like in the actual play. But, since I really don\u2019t like the actual story and what they did to the characters, I\u2019m not sure yet whether I\u2019d be willing to pay money for that.Out of all the characters, Hermione was the only one who still resembled who she used to be. I\u2019m proud that she has become Minister for Magic! I also really liked Minerva! And Draco proved he was a good parent (much better than Harry\u2026).I enjoyed the interactions between Albus and Scorpius! They\u2019re such good \u2018friends\u2019 (A.K.A. boyfriends).That was it. Those were the only thing I like. My list of dislikes is much longer! I had six full pages of notes. When I read a book that\u2019s over a thousand pages long, I don\u2019t even have that many notes! Let\u2019s get started:The plot is basically 90% about trying to bring back Cedric Diggory. I don\u2019t understand why Albus is so obsessed with Cedric. So many people died for Harry, why does it have to be Cedric? Obviously because Amos asked, but to have almost the entire plot of this play resolve around that\u2026I\u2019d rather read every single second of a class taught at Hogwarts! Because this wasn\u2019t magical enough. Sure, it features the characters we know and love and Hogwarts, but we rarely get to see actual magic. When Albus, Delphi and Scorpius are searching for the Time Turner in Hermione\u2019s office, they don\u2019t even try \u2018accio\u2019! Instead, they search the entire bookcase! Whenever we do get some magic, it isn\u2019t explained enough. Why couldn\u2019t Delphi use \u2018imperio\u2019 on Albus? She said: \u201cto fulfil the prophecy [\u2026] Imperio just won\u2019t do\u201d. Why not? Or when Harry transfigured into Voldemort\u2026 Is that even possible? Why would wizards go through the trouble of brewing polyjuice potion then? All of this is just very convenient, but didn\u2019t make enough sense.One of the things that bothered me most, was Ron Weasley\u2019s characterisation. He has become a caricature of the person he used to be. The only reason he\u2019s there, is for comic relief. All he does is eat and make stupid jokes. They act as if he\u2019s so dumb and doesn\u2019t take anything serious. Did Thorne actually read the original series before he wrote this? Because this is not the Ron I know! I refuse to believe that he was so drunk at his own wedding he doesn\u2019t remember anything. And why would Ron give someone love potion? He had a terrible experience with it when he was a teenager, why in the world would he do that? It doesn\u2019t make any sense!Another character who was completely butchered was Cedric Diggory. In the alternate universe where he lost the Triwizard Tournament, he becomes a death-eater and kills Neville. Cedric was one of the kindest characters. It\u2019s absurd to assume that he would become a racist murderer just because he got humiliated!Scorpius said: \u201cCedric was a different person entirely \u2013 dark, dangerous\u201d. We only found out that he killed Neville, but Scorpius didn\u2019t interact with him. I don\u2019t understand where this observation comes from. And I had that feeling quite a few times while reading this; as if I had skipped a couple of pages without realising it.Harry Potter is a terrible father. I didn\u2019t like him once in this \u2018book\u2019. Granted, Albus is a whiny teenager: he has no idea how privileged he is. Don\u2019t tell me he doesn\u2019t get special treatment because he\u2019s a Potter. A lot of people have it worse than him. Still, Harry had no right to say the things he did. And his excuse? He didn\u2019t have a father figure growing up. He had plenty! What about Arthur, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid and even Dumbledore, Harry?! Harry had no right to attack Minerva either. Just because a woman doesn\u2019t have children, doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t able to take care of them. She\u2019d be a much better parent than he ever was.And when did he become a psychic? His scar hurts, he actually hears Voldemort\u2019s voice and can speak Parseltongue again, but Delphi hadn\u2019t even saved Voldemort yet (actually, she never does). How is he able to do that if nothing has changed? Voldemort wasn\u2019t back, yet he acted as if he was? Once again, I just don\u2019t understand\u2026Also, what is up with Lily\u2019s blanket? I don\u2019t remember him ever talking about it in the books, yet now Harry pretends as if it\u2019s his most precious possession in the entire world. I know he didn\u2019t possess it in the other books, but it\u2019s still strange that he\u2019s so obsessed with it now.Oh, and the special privileges? Harry is at Hogwarts all the damn time! I don\u2019t remember parents being allowed there. I guess being a Potter does mean you\u2019re allowed to do more than others.A lot of people hate Severus Snape and don\u2019t see him as a brave person. While I don\u2019t feel as strongly about that as them, I completely understand why they feel that was. He was horrible to his pupils, particularly Hermione, Harry and Neville. But, in the alternative universe, Hermione and Ron secretly work together with him. He used to be so mean to them, it seems highly unlikely to me they would forgive him! Just because he didn\u2019t turn out to be a death-eater, doesn\u2019t mean it justifies his behaviour. Snape\u2019s interactions with Scorpius were so cringe-worthy. He isn\u2019t a nice guy who makes one or two jokes and he\u2019d never talk that openly about Lily.Because so many characters felt differently, I didn\u2019t care about them anymore. When Hermione and Ron sacrificed themselves and received the dementor\u2019s kiss, I felt nothing. On the one hand, I\u2019m sad we didn\u2019t get to see Sirius, Remus, Tonks an Teddy. But on the other hand, I\u2019m very glad, since their characters would have been butchered as well!This book almost pretends as if the other Potter and Granger-Weasley kids don\u2019t exist. Ever heard of Hugo???The timeline is so strange. Page 22 and a year has past. Page 27 and they\u2019re already starting their third year at Hogwarts. Seven pages later, another year has past! Surely, they could have given us a glimpse at their lives at Hogwarts without having to do it like this. Later on, Scorpius and Albus are in Scotland, without any brooms or wands. Yet the very next page, they\u2019re already in Godric\u2019s Hollow! How is that even possible? Again, this is not explained.And how did Albus and Scorpius know every single detail from what went down over twenty years ago at the Triwizard Tournament and Battle of Hogwarts? Did their parents tell them literally everything? Were very detailed books written? I need to know this!In the alternate universe, they kept mentioning an \u2018Augurey\u2019 and I had no idea what it meant. It\u2019s only explained many scenes later. I cannot stress enough how underdeveloped some plots were. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on because things weren\u2019t explained well enough. And that causes plot holes.I\u2019m so thankful they didn\u2019t use the Time Turner often in the Harry Potter series. I can already imagine how how things would have ended otherwise: Harry would have gone back in time and kill Voldemort and save James and Lily. Whenever a universe has the ability to time travel, that\u2019s the kind of things that happen. It\u2019s predictable. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is about. They go back in time over FOUR TIMES just to go back to how things were at the beginning of the play. It\u2019s such a waste of time. I can think of so many plots that would have been more interesting. Imagine there\u2019s ever going to be a F.R.I.E.N.D.S movie and it turns out Monica has left Chandler and never wants to see her children again. That wouldn\u2019t make any sense at all. But that is how Cursed Child feels like to me.Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favourite books an films, so I obviously have no problems with time travelling. But this was just too much.As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I really missed the magic. And of course the characters, because Cursed Child completely butchered them. Think of how much better this would be if it was about one school year at Hogwarts, without Voldemort trying to kill everyone. Just one year of the adventures Scorpius and Albus encounter. There didn\u2019t need to be this much family drama. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty sure this was the script of a Days of Our Lives or The Bold and the Beautiful episode instead! Just think how they could have explored the other houses, besides Gryffindor! But no, in Cursed Child, everyone is still prejudiced towards Slytherins and they pretend Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff don\u2019t even exist!This is only about three hundred pages long, yet it was so repetitive. Scorpius and Albus do something stupid; Draco, Harry and Ginny run after them and need Hermione because \u201ctheir children are missing!\u201d AGAIN!I also had some problems with the writing itself: Voldemort Day? \u2018Oh Potter\u2019 instead of \u2018Oh Shit\u2019? Mudbloods in the dungeons? The Blood Ball? WE GET IT, VOLDEMORT IS BACK! \u201cA Malfoy who may be a Voldemort\u201d Euhm, that\u2019s just awful writing. \u2018Voldemort\u2019 isn\u2019t a last name; it\u2019s not as if \u2018Lord\u2019 was his first name. It should have been \u2018Riddle\u2019 instead. \u2018Thank Dumbledore\u2019 instead of \u2018Thank God\u2019 is not only cheesy, it is also incredibly arrogant. I\u2019m not the most religious person but to say that Dumbledore is a God\u2026 It\u2019s so sexist that at the Triwizard Tournament, every school got a lot of cheers besides Beauxbatons! I know boys also attend it, but it\u2019s still more \u2018feminine\u2019 than Durmstrang or Hogwarts.Almost everyone who has read this, can\u2019t deny there is something going on between Albus and Scorpius. They are so gay! But of course, this book is heteronormative to the max! I can already hear J.K. Rowling in a couple of years: \u201cActually, they were dating, but it wasn\u2019t important to the story\u201d. Please don\u2019t give this woman any praise when it comes to diversity, she doesn\u2019t deserve it. The Cursed Child could have meant a great deal more if they weren\u2019t so afraid to include characters who aren\u2019t straight for a change. And don\u2019t even get me started on Albus\u2019 crush on Delphi. He\u2019s like fourteen and she was twenty? That\u2019s disgusting.Which brings me to Delphi, the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Do you really expect me to believe that Voldemort was capable of love and lust? Why do they feel the need to establish that every character is \u2018oh so straight\u2019?! Supposedly, Bellatrix gave birth to Delphi before the Battle of Hogwarts in Malfoy Manor. WHAT?! In Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, we actually see her there! Don\u2019t you think anyone would have noticed? DRACO ACTUALLY LIVED THERE! How oblivious is he supposed to be then? This doesn\u2019t make any sense!I could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my point. There were so many things that bothered me and I don\u2019t ever want to read this again. I regret paying this much money for it. I refuse to accept this as canon. I will pretend this doesn\u2019t exist. "},

In my opinion, I look at this as fanfiction of the series I hold close for many years. I protected myself from the feelings that would destroy my time reading this book by repeating that, and it turned out I thoght this book was helplessly fun even if it was not my fondness. However, I had a hunch that Rowling didn't take a big part in this book, it just \u2014 weird and wrong; I couldn't smell her signature in there.Albus Severus Potter takes a big role in this book. He has problems with his Dad, Harry, so he goes back into the time when Cedric was killed. And the consequence is really bad. REALLY REALLY BAD !I felt like this was another version of the Harry Potter franchise being thrown into the mix with The Butterfly Effect movie. Whoever wrote this\u2014 I can't remember their names\u2014 tried to insert and present the old characters to the play and the only way to do this was turning back time. It's so messy and does nothing good. There are many ways to present this without using this Into the Future plot.Instead of turning the prequel to the play, they showed us what happens after the epilogue of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Act one and two were interesting with a new character I liked. Scorpius, he's Draco's son and has very much chemistry whenever he's with Albus. Just one moment, I thought they're lovers, the dialogue : 'You two \u2014 you belong together' made me think that way and I couldn't help myself to ship them so hard till the end.  \"That\u2019s the thing, isn\u2019t it? About friendships. You don\u2019t know what he needs. You only know he needs it. Find him, Scorpius. You two \u2014 you belong together.\"(view spoiler)[I wanted to puke when I knew Delphi is the heir of Voldemort and Bellatrix. (hide spoiler)] Ummmmmm I don't even know when they had an affair or anything, it seemed unbelievable to me.Act four was hard to enjoy, though. I was afraid they might ruin everything in the previous books with a time-travel plot. Alas it ruined some parts of my feeling, but not much. It was just okay because I kept telling myself all the time but this is fanfiction and don't take it serious.All in all, I quite enjoyed this but I also hope wholeheartedly that this book is a full-length novel, not a script, or Rowling just let the story end that way with those seven books I want to cherish forever.I have a question. Will this book be turned into a full novel in the near future ? If it's a big YES, I'll read it undoutedly ! Because it might be better if the book is more descriptive than this.HP is my life, and this book is a drop of honey to quench my craving this year.More at https://goo.gl/I48iFE | http://goo.gl/m88lvl[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[I wanted to puke when I knew Delphi is the heir of Voldemort and Bellatrix.

This is not a novel per se, but a special edition featuring the rehearsal script for the theatrical play staged in London.  THE WAITING TIME  Love blinds.When I knew about the staging of a theatrical play about Harry Potter, it was a bittersweet feeling, since I was happy to know that there will be a new chapter in the wizarding world of Harry Potter but sad since I couldn\u2019t apparate in London to attend to that theatrical play and it was very unlikely to be ever set here, in Costa Rica. However, I was quite happily shocked when I read that there will be a publication of the theater script, and even better, published just a day later of the premiere of the theatrical play. I guessed that maybe after a couple of years, when the play would be presented in major cities, then, it would be a publication of the story, but happily, I have no doubt that the publishing houses (UK u0026amp; USA) wanted a piece of the magical new cake.  The world changes and we change with it.So, I counted the days, I enlisted myself in a waiting list in the main local bookstore here. I even checked out twice to verify that I was still in the list! I didn\u2019t want that any Death Eater mischief would deprive me of having the new book of Harry Potter, in the very day of its publication.Since the last book (the seventh) of Harry Potter, I\u2019d read the novels of Cormoran Strike series, written also by J.K. Rowling (under the pseudonym of \u201cRobert Galbraith\u201d), and not matter my opinion about those books\u2026\u2026it wasn\u2019t the same!They weren\u2019t Harry Potter books!!!This incoming (and already published) book was something else, it was a NEW story about the wizarding world of Harry Potter.And I was there, in the bookstore, buying the book, and once I had it finally in my hands\u2026\u2026I had a wicked smile in my face!  WHAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR HANDS  \u2026there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic.I loved the book! I-LOVED-THE-BOOK-!It could be better? Yes, obviously anything can be better, but there isn\u2019t such thing as perfection in this world, so why crying for the impossible and not enjoying what you really have at hand?  The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.You have a Harry Potter book in your hands! A new story! A canon tale! Don\u2019t you get it?You have magic in your hands!!!Enjoy it. Hug the book. Feel the dust jacket. Smell the pages. Read it without rush.Not every day you can read real magic translated into words.  BACK TO THE MAGIC  They were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what \u2013 those flaws almost made them greater.The story is set nineteen years later of the end of the events in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.Harry Potter is already an adult, married, with three children, and full of work in his position at the Ministry of Magic (No, I won\u2019t tell which is, but it\u2019s cool!!!).Hermione Granger is an adult too, married, with two kids, and with a position too in the Ministry of Magic (No, I won\u2019t tell neither, but it\u2019s cooooool!!!).And you will have the most of your favorite characters (minus Luna Lovegood, which sadly wasn\u2019t used in the book) and it will be exciting to read about how their lives follow after the last time that you read about them, specially since the story is set so many years later.This isn\u2019t only a new chapter in the wizarding world of Harry Potter but a closure, where we can feel the consequences of the events through the saga, how they impacted in the past, how they are driving the present, and how they can modeling the future.Albus Severus Snape, the youngest son of Harry Potter, isn\u2019t having an easy childhood since there is the huge family legacy which is a too heavy burden for a young boy.Scorpius Malfoy, the only son of Draco Malfoy, isn\u2019t having an easy childhood neither since his own kind of family legacy is still something that a kid shouldn\u2019t suffer besides his own normal teenage troubles.An unexpected friendship will be forged.And as before, the power of friendship will be key to save the world.The Battle of Hogwarts was won by the heroes. Voldemort is dead. For nineteen years, peace has been enjoyed.However, there is still a powerful force of evil around, a new one but linked with the old dark magic, and with an ambitious agenda that can literally re-write everything that we already had for granted, rising a new dark age like any other before!You\u2019ll have magical adventures, you\u2019ll face exciting challenges, you\u2019ll have priceless surprises.You\u2019ll laugh. You\u2019ll cry. You\u2019ll live again the wizarding world of Harry Potter!!!  Those we love never truly leave us,\u2026 There are things that death cannot touch.The magical world of Harry Potter will never leave us, we\u2019ll have it in our hearts forever.Thank you, J.K. Rowling......thank you for sharing your magic with us."},

Thankfully, our town is kind of small so despite there being a dozen or so people there wasn't a lot overall like there would be in a larger city. I saw spoilers for this book months ago and I was slightly disappointed by them. Thankfully, in the entirety of this book I enjoyed them. They were absolutely well done in the way that I couldn't put the book down for the three and a half hours it too me to read it. I'll do my best to mark spoilers, but it's quite difficult considering spoilers are what I love to do it seems. I loved reading about our next generation characters though I had some problems (hence a four star rating). I was frustrated that we didn't get to see more of Lily and James. They popped up in the beginning but basically disappeared once the storyline got intense. The same goes for Rose. I understand that Albus didn't like her but Scorpius did. Though, she didn't like Scorpius. I just wish she could have been included in their adventures a bit more, maybe making a trio among themselves. I also didn't like the fact Teddy didn't feature at all, and we didn't get to see Molly or Arthur or George or Charlie or Fleur or Percy or Bill or Victorie. I wish there was more to characters that I was thinking about at the end of Deathly Hallows.The script format of the book got a tad frustrating in some parts. I understand it's the special edition script and all of that, and I'm lucky to have read scripts before so I could follow it well, but at some parts I had to re-read sections in order to grasp the setting. In the beginning, it didn't feel much like JK Rowling to me either. To be fair though, I only read the Harry Potter books for the first time this year. But, I felt like the dialogue was forced in a way that made me uncomfortable to read interactions between Rose, Albus and Scorpius. Characters - probably spoilersThere were so many characters present in the book, so I'm going to try to focus on the primary three in order to keep this review an acceptable length. Albus was one of our three primary characters (along with Harry and Scorpius). He was frustrating. He made me want to punch him in the nose countless times. Albus just didn't feel like he belonged no matter the effort people put into trying to make him feel as if he did and as soon as he was sorted into Slytherin it was used as an excuse to basically be an asshole to his family. Sure, James and Lily teased him but that's what siblings do. They won't fall at your feet because Harry Potter is your father, because he's their father too. Despite the fact Albus hated how people only saw him for his father (it happened like twice his first year in the script and that was when he was sorted). I loved his character development though. Going from a sullen boy who hated everything to one who could now see the world with open eyes was great. I no longer wanted to punch him in between the eyes when the book was finished and that's some hardcore character development in my opinion. Scorpius was my favourite character by far. A character who had been plagued by rumours that he was actually Voldemort's son and not Draco's would have hurt, but this kid didn't let it get him down. He was smart, funny, and optimistic. The best friend to Albus as well. Scorpius, however, was a follower and no way a leader. I did get annoyed when he let Albus push him around or order him around. It made me want to punch him in between his eyes. Though, we do have Scorpius stand up for himself at the end of the book. Using his intelligence as well to save the day. He was the Hermione Granger of his duo (Albus being both Ron and Harry combined). Harry is now Minister of Law Enforcement, I can't remember the exact title don't shoot me, he is also nearing the ripe age of 40. I couldn't really connect with Harry in this book, he didn't seem to be trying a lot of the time to help Albus but decided to just blame himself and be done with it. In the book Harry compares himself to Dumbledore (in a negative way) and I couldn't have agreed more (I'm not a Dumbledore fan). Thankfully, character development exists and we have Harry working himself out to connect with his middle child - the one \"named after the two bravest men he knew\". I don't really have much to say on Harry. He was more so a side character. Though, I enjoyed the fact through him we got to see Draco, Hermione, Ron, Ginny and Minerva. World-BuildingThe world-building wasn't exactly there. I presume the expectation to read this book is that you have read the first seven books in order to understand both jokes and the magic. Since it's a script it also lacks the detail that Rowling provided in the original series. However, knowing the world made this enticing. I loved how we got to see different places and travel back in time. It was still incredibly well done, but obviously not up to the standard I was expecting in a Rowling book. PlotThe plot was magnificent in my opinion. Sure, if you've read the spoilers, it doesn't seem that exciting. It seems a bit all over the place. It wasn't. It flowed perfectly for the most part (only confusing me a few times). I loved how the past and present intertwined and how mistakes were made that had to be rectified. I wasn't expecting the ending, (view spoiler)[with Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. It definitely shocked me. I mean, I didn't trust Delphi but damn, I wasn't expecting that. I must have missed the spoiler (hide spoiler)] Oh, and (view spoiler)[Snape in the world where Voldemort was a ruler was actually a pretty good guy. I wasn't even mad and I'm definitely not a Snape fan. (hide spoiler)] OH, OH (view spoiler)[I'm also pissed we never got to see Neville. That's all I freaking wanted. (hide spoiler)]WritingThe writing was phenomenal. Despite the fact it was a script the dialogue was poetic and classic Rowling, with classic quotes from the original series and characters. There were also scenes from (view spoiler)[The Goblet of Fire (hide spoiler)] which provided a sense of nostalgia. It was enticing in the way, as well, that it was a script, though it definitely made the book feel shorter than what it was. OverallOverall, THIS BOOK IS LOVE. THIS BOOK IS LIFE. THIS BOOK IS A GIFT TO HUMAN KIND. THIS BOOK BROUGHT ME TO TEARS. THIS BOOK HAS LEFT ME ACHING FOR MORE.I desperately wish I could go to England to watch the play. It would be beautiful to see on stage. I also liked the fact I could imagine both the play cast and movie cast in this script. It did lack some of the personality of characters, like Harry, but it was still a spectacular read and dive back into the magical world. EDIT 01/08/16: I have to add in the fact that Scorpius telling Rose she smells like bread is my favourite scene in the script. Primarily becasue I love bread and those two are my new OTP.EDIT 07/08/16: I keep thinking about this book and my massive problem with it - The Trolley Lady. I felt that the random plotline of her being robot like or immortal was strange and completely unnesscary. It keeps bothering me, even days after I finished this book and I remembered I hadn't mentioned it in my review. [with Bellatrix and Voldemort's daughter. It definitely shocked me.

Okay, so this is my first book I\u2019ve read by JK Rowling. My husband pre-ordered and it was sitting on my kindle so I decided to jump in. I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed this book. The story is written in as a play- so the format is like a script. Which was fine by me, I was a thespian and have read many scripts, so it was easy to follow. I think it would be easy for anyone to follow, though. This book focuses on Harry Potter\u2019s son, Albus Severus Potter. Albus is getting ready to go into his first year at Hogwarts and he is nervous. Which house will he be sorted into? Will he make friends? Being the son of Harry Potter isn't an easy thing for Albus. There was a lot of action and twists and turns in this story, and I\u2019ll keep that a surprise for readers, but what I really loved about this book was the friendship between Albus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. Scorpius was by far my favorite character in this book. I adored him.       \u201cThe world changes and we change with it. I am better off in this world. But the world is not better. And I don\u2019t want that.\u201d  u2028I also really loved seeing our favorite characters grown up and parents. Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione, even Draco. I loved how much Draco loved his son. I\u2019ve seen a lot of fans of this book not love the script. And a lot of them are completely fan-girling over it. I liked it a lot. It wasn\u2019t an epic 5 star read for me, but I thought it was good. Once I finally read the entire series, I\u2019ll come back and re-read and see what I think. For now, I give it 4 stars because it was highly entertaining and I didn\u2019t want to put it down.(This is just a fun picture collage of my sister and me at the midnight release. That Patronus on the drink menu was delicious and there were tons of people dressed up! We had a blast :) )  "},

Post-post review edit: The more I think about this book, the more I want to rate it lower. So I did. (Please don't throw things at me.) And this review needed more gifs, so sorry, not sorry. 2/5 starsI never thought the day would come when I would be disappointed by a Harry Potter book. Harry Potter was the foundation of my childhood. I started reading this series when I was eight, and my obsession took off from there. I was Hermione Granger for Halloween when I was nine. I forced my mom to read the books. I regularly had Harry Potter movie marathons on the weekend. My best friend and I spent countless hours theorizing about it. I've re-read each book at least seven times. Even when I got older, and my tastes changed, I could still read Harry Potter and fall in love with the wizarding world all over again. I don't know how I feel about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Did I have my issues? Hell yes. Did I feel an overwhelming sense of nostalgia despite everything? Also yes. One thing I could not stand about this book was the script format. I am not an actress. The only shows I've been in were mandatory school plays, so I am not familiar with reading scripts. Excuse me, but I wanted beautiful descriptions of Hogwarts, not choppy dialog that sounds like poorly written fanfiction.I did like things about this book - Scorpius Malfoy, seeing all of my favourite characters again, Scorpius Malfoy, being back at Hogwarts, Scorpius Malfoy - but besides that, and as much as it breaks my heart to say this, I didn't really enjoy the Cursed Child. Not like I enjoyed the other books. I wanted to give this book 2 stars because of all the issues I had with it. But I also wanted to give it 4 stars because I feel terrible rating any Harry Potter book lower than that. I decided in the end that I wouldn't rate this book. I'd write my review, accept that it's a part of the Harry Potter universe, and leave it be. As you can see from my two star rating, I got over that pretty quickly.A word of forewarning: I will be jumping into a full, spoilery, rant/discussion now.(view spoiler)[This isn't so much a review as it is more of a (barely) legible list of my thoughts. Things I did not like:1) The characters did not seem like their characters.What the hell was up with Harry during this? This was not the Harry Potter that I read about for so many years, this was someone else entirely. Though I don't exactly think he was a bad father (as he had pretty shitty role models for parenting) he still did not seem like himself. The entire time, I just wanted to scream at him. Harry, I love you, but what the fuck are you doing? Get your shit together.2) The plot was predictable.I knew from the start, just from a gut feeling, that Albus would be sorted into Slytherin, and whoop dee do, look who was right? I knew something was up with Delphi around the halfway mark - I trusted her for a bit, but after that, I knew she was our antagonist. I didn't think she was Voldemort's daughter, though, which leads me to my next point.3) I do not believe for one goddamn second that Voldemort had a child.I don't care if this is supposedly canon, I don't believe Voldemort would ever have a kid. Seriously, when they said Voldemort had a daughter, I burst out laughing, thinking, \"Voldemort? A daughter? Sure. Who's the mother? Bellatrix Lestrange?\" Now let me just say, I thought Bellatrix would be the mother as a joke. I knew she was infatuated with him, but I never thought she'd actually have sex with the Dark Lord. When Delphi said she was the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange, I almost choked on my water. They should've written on the back of this book: Warning: Do not consume food or beverages whilst reading this book. Choking on water due to the reveal that Bellatrix and Voldemort did the do may be potentially fatal. 4) Scorpius and Albus didn't end up together.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm normally fine with my ships not working out. In fact, I'm used to it. But when you throw around lines like \"you need each other\" or some shit, I'm probably going to board that ship and sail away while giving zero effs. And when you end the book without that ship reaching it's destination in the Land of Canon, I'm still going to cling on to that ship as it sinks to the bottom of the Sea of Broken Dreams. My hopes that Scorpius/Albus would work out is one of the only things that kept me going throughout this mess.5) The use of time-turners in this book was atrocious.Clearly, these characters do not know the basic theories of time-travel. I'm a huge sci-fi/science geek, and I think time-travel is one of the most interesting concepts it has to offer. Can I just start a petition to force the characters of the Cursed Child to watch Doctor Who so they'd know how unbelievably moronic they were? The mere idea that they could save Cedric was incredibly stupid! They should have at least guessed that going back in time and changing a huge part of it might permanently fuck up the future. Come on, Albus:Seriously though, shouldn't it just be common sense? 6) Cedric the Death EaterI'm sorry, but you're telling me that sweet Cedric, who was too pure and good for the wizarding world, became a Death Eater?7) There were some serious \"what the actual fuck\" moments in this.The Trolley Witch. The goddamn Trolley Witch. What even was that scene? Things I liked:1) Scorpius Malfoy.Scorpius Malfoy is a precious child that must be protected at all costs. That is all. (Well, seeing Snape and the rest of the cast was great, too, but Scorpius Malfoy.)I am going to treat the Cursed Child like it's fanfiction, because as it turns out, we didn't need an eighth Harry Potter book. The way the series ended was perfect. It didn't need a spin-off. And it sure as hell didn't need this.

Before I started writing this review I went on Wikipedia, just to be sure, and found this:Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a two-part West End stage play written by Jack Thorne based on an original new story by Thorne, J.K. Rowling and John Tiffany. [...]The rehearsal script, not a novelization of the play, was released on 31 July 2016 and became the eighth story set in the Harry Potter universe.You have to understand that, being this a play, the structure is completely different from the other seven books. I totally agree with other reviewers that this book should not exist, or at least not like this.Part of the reason I didn't enjoy this was because of the format, and I would have preferred a novelization for the people that live on the other side of the world and really can't go out and see the play. But the format was just the least of my problems. I went into this knowing about the format but I wasn't expecting something so bad. This wasn't written by JK Rowling, this meaning the script. She wrote the original story with two other people but then the script was written by someone else, not her.And this explain the fan-fiction feelings most of us experienced. I admit that I haven't read many HP fan-fictions because I'm very specific about my ships and couldn't really find anything to satisfy me in the past (I know, very profound) but in some parts nothing made sense.This felt like the kind of fan-fiction where the characters don't even act like themselves. I'm pissed off because they ruined Ron's character - which is one of my favorites in the whole series, all he did was joking around like the court jester. And don't even let me start with Draco.It was hard to concentrate on the plot when everyone was acting so differently and wrong.And the ending... are we supposed to just believe that? Are you fucking kidding me? This book should not be considered part of the Harry Potter series, I'm sorry. They put effort in it but it was a mess, everyone acted like a totally different character (especially Ron, Harry and Dumbledore) and the plot was repetitive and weak. /////////////////////////////Original reaction (I'm keeping it in my review because this gif is way too funny):  "},

I've read the series a few times and consider the series a staple of my childhood and an all-time favorite. Those books got me through hard times where the only thing I could do was escape to a better and magical world through books. I should've felt ecstatic at the thought of a new Harry Potter story but I was just so certain it would be disappointing. I knew I would read it no matter what but my expectations were just so low.The Harry Potter series likely established my love for reading and I always felt like I grew up with Harry. Reading the books now and even watching the films brings true nostalgic feelings, but also a sadness that nothing else will ever be as good. Nothing will bring me those feelings of joy and wonder I experienced the first time I read Harry Potter.But last night I got a little taste of that joy again. This screenplay is not perfect by any means. There are moments where the characters behave so OOC and it's so obvious that JK Rowling did not write this. But then there are parts that reminded me why I love this world and this story so much. Overall I feel like this screenplay captured that same wonderful magical atmosphere that JK Rowling created in her books, while introducing new characters and a new plot. It's the kind of beautiful story I expect from JK Rowling, and I'm delighted to say I enjoyed this so much more than I thought I would.The direction of the plot was completely surprising for me (to be honest I didn't even read the synopsis. Like I said, low expectations) 10% in and my heart was already breaking. The story began unexpectedly sad when I had expected more of a lighthearted adventure. The plot lacked the depth of the books but then this is a screenplay that takes about three hours to read. I really enjoyed the plot and found it totally engrossing (I stayed up til 4 am to read the whole thing in one sitting. No regrets). I don't want to divulge anything about it but I felt it maintained the right balance of revisiting the characters, places, and elements we loved from the series and also presenting some new things. I felt completely immersed back into this world, which was something I didn't think this screenplay would be able to do.I loved the new characters- Albus Severus Potter and Scorpius Malfoy. Albus seems to be nothing like his father. He hates Hogwarts and has no friends (besides Scorpius). He's not athletic and he is really a very average wizard. He feels like a disappointment to his father, like he'll never live up to his father's legacy. This was all pretty unexpected and sad for me. When I envisioned the future for Harry and co. I had basically assumed it would be a happily ever after type of situation, not family turmoil. I had expected Albus to be a lot like his father and the story to be like Harry Potter redux, but that's not what it was and I am so happy for that. This was a beautiful and meaningful story that stands on it's own. Scorpius is also an outcast for reasons you'll have to read about. But Albus and Scorpius form a true friendship and the story of their friendship gave me those same sentimental feelings as the original story where the bond and love amongst friends is more powerful than anything.Harry doesn't know how to communicate with his struggling son who is so different from him. This is where it got sort of weird. Seeing all these characters I loved as a child behaving as adults was just weird. It seemed OOC to me but then I don't know, maybe they're just adults now. Ron is just a jokester now. Ginny has no personality at all. Draco seemed a little too nice/sentimental to me. I debated with myself for awhile about how I felt about this. There's two ways this could go- I could criticize the book for reading more like \"fanfiction\" and not staying true to the original characters or I can appreciate and love this story for allowing me to experience the joy of immersing myself in the wonder, excitement, and adventure of the wizarding world once again, which is something I never thought would be possible. I'm choosing the latter. Despite its flaws, I found the screenplay to be true to the original series in the sense that it encapsulates the same warm and magical aura of the books and a beautiful story where love and friendship conquer all. To be honest, I didn't go into this expecting the same characters I originally fell in love with, and so I didn't find it that disappointing.Overall, this screenplay far exceeded my expectations. I'm dying to see this play (but that's a far off dream) and kept envisioning what it would look like on stage as I read. Tbh I don't ever read books in screenplay format. I found it off-putting at first but got used to it and then even started enjoying it, it was a very quick and easy read (except for a scene involving polyjuice potion that got a little confusing haha) and something I know I'll read again and again. And now I'm left with the same devastated feeling I had when I finished Deathly Hallows. It's overrrrrrrr and it's time to return to reality D: I guess it's time for another reread :)"},

Me niego a verlo como una continuaci\u00f3n de la serie, porque, si lo viese as\u00ed, esto resultar\u00eda ser una estafa. Si pensara en lo que he le\u00eddo en los anteriores siete libros teniendo en cuenta lo que sucede en este, me dar\u00eda la sensaci\u00f3n de que todo lo que pas\u00f3 a lo largo de aquellos siete libros carece de valor real. La profundidad de Harry Potter se terminar\u00eda transformando en un relato superficial y merecedor de mi m\u00e1s intensa rabieta de ni\u00f1o de siete a\u00f1os.Con el paso de los a\u00f1os, Harry Potter se ha ido transformando en una enfermedad pand\u00e9mica que tiene como principal s\u00edntoma la incapacidad de decir adi\u00f3s a lo que nos ha dado tanta felicidad. No podemos dar por hecho que todo tiene su fin y que hay que aceptarlo. Tenemos que lanzar teor\u00edas disparatadas con asiduidad para seguir d\u00e1ndole bombo a una saga que es excelente as\u00ed como est\u00e1. Y Rowling, para m\u00ed err\u00f3neamente, se ha unido al club que se encarga de responder la pregunta \"\u00bfqu\u00e9 podr\u00eda estar pasando ahora en la vida de Harry Potter?\". Las elucubraciones entusiastas de la criatura adolescente y chillona (\u00bfy codiciosa?) que habita en el cuerpo de la autora concibi\u00f3 este libro que no deber\u00eda haberse publicado.No est\u00e1 de m\u00e1s hacer notar el infantilismo. Jam\u00e1s me pude tomar en serio lo que suced\u00eda. En la \u00fanica parte que sent\u00ed como real lo que pasaba fue en el final, que, s\u00ed, lo admito, me conmovi\u00f3. No obstante, el argumento me result\u00f3 forzado y plagado de errores. No sigue una l\u00ednea coherente y fracasa en hacer veros\u00edmiles los hechos. Rowling (y Jack Thorne, lo s\u00e9, pero Rowling es la responsable de su historia) hizo algo muy arriesgado, y lamentablemente le sali\u00f3 mal. Si Harry Potter and the Cursed Child hubiese sido m\u00e1s simple \u2014y m\u00e1s corto\u2014, no tengo dudas de que habr\u00eda funcionado a la perfecci\u00f3n.No me quiero olvidar de los personajes. En este libro los personajes que me eran tan preciados fueron sometidos a un recorte descuidado de su tridimensionalidad. Quiz\u00e1 esto se deba al formato de guion, pero asimismo sus di\u00e1logos y lo que se entreve\u00eda de sus reacciones me resultaron falsos y endebles. Tambi\u00e9n es evidente, en un intento de tocar las fibras sensibles del lector, el abuso de la emoci\u00f3n y la sensibler\u00eda en sus relaciones, y eso le quit\u00f3 el atractivo a las partes aut\u00e9nticamente sentimentales. Prefiero quedarme con los recuerdos de los personajes que le\u00ed en los anteriores libros, no con estas copias quebradizas. Pero no todo es queja. Como dije al principio, veo a esta obra como una historia separada de la saga original; me reh\u00faso a anexarla a las brillantes anteriores entregas. No son congruentes. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child es un sue\u00f1o compartido de J. K. Rowling y sus admiradores insatisfechos, un sue\u00f1o que se rompe en mil pedazos cuando se termina de leer la \u00faltima p\u00e1gina. Tomo este libro como una muy buena historia sobre la amistad, los temores de un padre con su hijo y que me hizo sentir, obviamente, la nostalgia del reencuentro. En fin. No es un libro malo, pero es innecesario. Me duele decir que esta sobreexplotaci\u00f3n de la historia hizo m\u00e1s mal que bien. No puedo recomendar leerlo. Como libro aislado est\u00e1 bastante bueno, pero no esperen algo de calidad. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child es adictivo, entretenido, tiene giros sorprendentes (al menos yo no los vi venir) y es muy probable que te conmueva, no obstante, arruina un poco, ir\u00f3nicamente, la magia de la saga."},

It easily fits into the cannon, with tons of revisited scenes from the originals in the form of dreams and timey-wimey stuff, but there's a reason for all of that and it's not a lack of imagination. At this point, it's both nostalgia and crazy emotional crap for the poor kids of Harry and Draco, who just happen to be best buds. Gotta love the drama around those households when the parents get into their shit, right?What's surprising is how much of a pain it is being the sons of these particular famous peeps, and just how much it turns them into loners and losers and misunderstood outcasts, and therefore ripe for our sympathy. It's a tried and true method, even for Rowling, but it's no less effective here than it was for Harry. It's odd how the same sins are always revisited, right? Well it's true across time and surrogate parentages and all the mistakes that everyone keeps making despite the very best of intentions.The drama is pure. And if you're worried that there won't be enough magic and excitement and NUTSO altered realities on huge scales and truly horrific reversals, then just relax and get very anxious, because I sat on the edge of my seat as I saw this play performed in my mind. :)Will I scream bloody murder if this doesn't get made into a movie down the line after the play-cycle has ended?Yes. Yes I will. It's a good Harry Potter book, damn it. It changes the meanings of books 3 and book 4 in their interpretations and their importance. It makes me want to do another close read of them to pick out the pieces and see where they tie back into the play. :) There's some pretty cool nit-picky stuff here for us, folks. I'm loving the easter eggs.Satisfying? Very much so. Fathers and father figures were always big in the series and it's even better now with Albus and Harry. I got all teary. :)Don't worry about all the haters. This stuff is good. :) "},

Obviously we are not used to those last names being friends, let alone best friends, but their friendship is the best thing about this story. The second best thing is seeing Slytherin in a positive light. We, so far, have only read thing in this series that star Gryffindor's golden child. Reading other perspectives and representations of Hogwarts houses was amazing, and I wish we could get a lot more of it. I was hesitant when I found out this script was going to be released as a book. All around me, everyone was jumping up and down, squealing with excitement. I was just going over in my head all the things that could go wrong. The Harry Potter series was perfect, and I didn't want a dark cloud looming over what I consider my childhood.I still went to the midnight release party (shout out to Henderson, NV's Barnes u0026amp; Noble for being absolutely amazing, and throwing together an equally amazing and organized event!), I still felt like a kid on Christmas, I still got extremely emotional when actually purchasing this book, I still took a selfie and posted it on all my social media outlets, because I was so thankful to be able to go to a midnight release party that celebrates my favorite books of all time. Especially when I believed there would never be another midnight release after Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  in 2007.The Harry Potter magic is still alive and I was holding it with my own two hands. Every page I turned in Act One was like returning to the best place on Earth. I was even more emotional while reading and I had to stop myself every few pages just to collect my feelings. This, this magic I can't describe, is why I want to give this book five stars. No other series in the world can do this and it's not all about the nostalgia factor. Harry Potter is truly magic, and that magic deserves all the stars in the world.I'm sorry, but the rest of this review is going to be filled with *SPOILERS*. I'm really not sure how to express my feelings without talking about major plot (or lack thereof) points. The biggest issue I need to address, and hope I'm not alone with this feeling, is that Harry Potter and the Cursed Child felt like the biggest queer bait in the entire world. This feeling wasn't brought about from me just hoping, there is so much subtext to help establish that Albus and Scorpius had something more than friendship. The evidence was so overwhelming, I was completely convinced and, more importantly, happy that J.K. Rowling was finally giving us something more than \"oh, Dumbledore was gay\". But alas, the entire book makes you believe these two were in love and it's for nothing. This was by far my biggest disappointment in this book.My next biggest disappointment was the fact that Harry Potter was an asshole. Like, a really big asshole. The way he spoke to McGonagall, when trying to force her to monitor his child's every movement, left me speechless. I wanted to stop reading the book right then and there.And that terrible conversation came after he already said an unforgivable comment to Albus. I am not a mother, even though I hope to one day be one, but I can't imagine, under any circumstance, would I ever tell my child I wish they weren't my child. What a horrible thing to say, that is completely filled with hate. This is the boy I watched grow up and become to the most powerful wizard of all time, while learning lesson after lesson of how to be a good person? I was dumbfounded. But you want to know who was a good father? Draco Malfoy. God, what I would give to read J.K. Rowling canon of Astoria Malfoy, who was able to help shape Draco and Scorpius into the men they are in this play. Draco showed such exponential growth, not only in this script, but since his time at Hogwarts. Such a wonderful character, and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child portrayed him spectacularly. Oh, and he totally saved the day. The other character I liked a lot was Delphi. I'm going to guess others will not feel this way, because Delphi feels like the biggest fan-fiction thing about this book, but I still enjoyed it. For those of you who are masochist and are spoiling themselves by reading my review, Delphi is Voldemort and Bellatrix Lestrange's love child. Now, I know that this timeline feels questionable, because Delphi was supposed to be born before the Battle of Hogwarts, but I still let it slide and just enjoyed the \"surprise\". I also felt a great deal of empathy for Delphi. I think Act Four in Godric's Hollow was so sad for her, because all she wanted was to have her dad and have him be proud of her. Like, I know she was going to ruin the world, but her reasoning really resonated inside me, and I could understand her pain and desperation.I was not expecting Cedric Diggory to play such a major role in this story. As much as I love Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I wasn't crazy about this plot line. I just seemed like a convenient plot they could manipulate into making people feel that Harry Potter nostalgia. Speaking of convenient plots, I felt like the time turners were also too convenient. It worked amazing for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, but it felt so wrong here. I hated this plot device, and I have to assume that time turners are all different, because the two in this book didn't work the same as the one in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I didn't like it at all, and I couldn't stop thinking about how freaking dangerous these things are, and how no one has used them in nineteen years, but all of a sudden the Potters have access to two? Talk about a big ass grey area plot point.Other things that felt horrible:-Dumbledore and Harry confessing their love to one another. Like, can you guys not? It felt so forced and awkward. I hated everything about that scene, which could have been a beautiful moment had it happened in the actual series and not nineteen years later.-No one even talking about Teddy Lupin! Like, I've already said Harry was acting like a shitty father in this book; I shouldn't be surprised if he's a shitty godfather as well. -Getting to see Lily get sorted, but no mention of Hugo's sorting. It felt so weird for them to say his name a couple of times, but get nothing about his character. I understand his last name isn't Potter, so he isn't as important to this world, but he felt so neglected to me. -How unlikable Rose, Ron and Hermione's child, was. -The Trolley Witch. Like, what the fuck did I just read? -The baby Harry's blanket. Like, did they sneak into the house and steal baby Harry's blanket so they could write a message on it for present-day Harry? I am not too convinced that Lily and James wouldn't have seen them, since they literally sacrifice themselves to protect Harry a few hours later. So why am I giving this book, that I just ripped apart with my review, five stars? Because Act One of this play brought me more joy than any other book has in nine years. Yes, I am disappointed and, yes, I will agree that the majority of this felt like fan-fiction, but I can't even put into words what small parts of this script did to me. I feel so thankful and so blessed that I was able to peak inside this world that was such a big reason for my happiness growing up. And in this world, that unconditional love and happiness deserve more than five stars. I'm sorry if this review is all over the place with things I liked and didn't like. I completely apologize if this seems really unorganized to you. I literally just sat down and starting typing all my feelings out and ended up having this cathartic experience. I completely understand the plot holes, and I hope I've listed all the major ones, and I understand that many of these characters that I grew up with were not acting like themselves. I also understand that I'm choosing to ignore a lot of these things, because, honestly, mostly nostalgia. I understand these one star reviews, and if I could separate myself from all the things that Harry Potter means to me, I probably wouldn't give this a five star rating.

Whereas novels are brought to life by one person - the author - plays are always brought to life by a whole team. There's a writer, a director, actors, set designers, costume designers, lighting technicians, sound technicians. (This is also a reason I don't at all fault Rowling for not writing the script herself, that's not HER job.) So just reading the dialogue will never, ever, capture the full life of the play.Reading this, I could see it come to life in my head, and I can completely see why this was the chosen medium for the next installment in the Harry Potter Universe. We've experienced this world in books, in movies, in a theme park where we can immerse ourselves, and now this is the chance to bring the magic to life in real-time before a live audience. Reading this script made me so badly want to see the play live! I can imagine the stage magic! The things we can pull off in theater are amazing. And I personally love when plays utilize not just the stage, but then entire auditorium like a few scenes in this did. This would be an amazing experience!As for the story, I thought it was nostalgic as well as new. It explored a few of the theories I've seen floating around in the wake of Deathly Hallows and I enjoyed that. I LOVED seeing Harry and gang as adults and getting to know them as parents. They act differently, yes, but I am not the same as I was at 17 either, that's normal! It was a whole new side and hit home for me as an adult who's grown up with HP as such a large part of pop culture.The ONE thing that bothered me was (view spoiler)[ the mechanics of the time travel. When the boys changed the first task in the past, their present was changed and they returned to an alternate timeline. Then when they went back to change the second task, they did it from this new timeline, a world in which even if they changed the second task, the first had already been messed with by them. They should have gone back and corrected their first meddling before changing another task. This made no sense to me.But I suppose \"real\" time travel doesn't exist so there are no concrete rules for me to point to to say this was wrong. And even if time travel were real, they would have never known they needed to go back because they would have already gone back and fixed it, thus they wouldn't need to go back and fix it. But that doesn't make for an interesting story for ANY book or movie. And seeing as this is a fantasy world where magic exists, I guess I can overlook the dodgy time travel, because many other things defy science in this series too.

The writing is in no way on par with JK Rowling's usual brilliancy, nor was the plot. Everything felt hasty and a bit half-assed.However, I enjoyed the book's nostalgia factor and, as mentioned above, the fan service that made everything hugely entertaining.For specific thoughts, here is my spoilery review:(view spoiler)[I read this book together with my slash-shipper friend, at the same time in the same room, and we paused literally every thirty seconds and quoted the book at each other because we couldn't believe how much shipping material was contained in the pages. The reading experience was UNREAL.A few notable examples:Draco: (About Albus) \"You don't know what he needs. You only know he needs it. Find him, Scorpius. You two - you belong together.\"God I ship this so hard.ALBUS (to Scorpius): \"As pleasurable as it will be to hide in a hole with you for the next forty years...\"PLEASURABLE. He just HAD to use that word.Draco bounces Harry up and down on the table.I'm hardly even breathing anymore.He touches his son's shoulder. And the two of them - just slightly - melt together.Ummmmmmmmm...? Obviously I don't ship this but whaaaaat is with that subtext there?So THATS what I mean when I say \"fanservice\".I had lots of little issues with the plot.How come Harry was so out of character - he was horrible! He made both Albuses cry!Why was Delphi able to stay in the past for so long in Godric's Hollow when the time turner only works for 5 minutes at a time?How come nobody was looking out for potential saboteurs like Albus at the Triwizard Tournament?I refuse to believe Albus and Scorpius stole from Hermione without getting caught, or that Draco just had a Time Turner lying around at his house!If Delphi never went to Hogwarts how did she learn magic?Many plot points felt too easy or made little sense.I loved seeing some of my favorite characters again. I practically hyperventilated when Snape appeared. Draco had a very prominent role as a father and as his own person. We got a unique look at Draco's personality away from the war with Voldemort; in truth he's proud but compassionate and loyal. Draco's definitely not a villain here.Most of the characters acted like themselves - the best example is McGonagall commenting \"I daresay it's my fault for owning a fireplace\" when everyone keeps ruining her carpet with floo powder. It was so lovely to reconnect with those characters again. Some characters however acted nothing like I knew them - Harry was a dick, and Dumbledore was an emotional wreck part of the time. I was very surprised.Cedric was a central point in the Cursed Child. Albus' quest starts with saving Cedric and the book closes with the acceptance of Cedric's death. The simple scene of Harry apologizing at Cedric's grave for getting him killed, for reducing his value to the \"spare\", was in my opinion vital to the Harry Potter series as a whole. The tragedy surrounding Cedric's end was never discussed enough at length in books 4-7. This revisit was necessary for closure.Am I alone in feeling like The Cursed Child didn't read like Rowling's work? Much of the play didn't achieve the plot intricacy and character depth I've always loved in Rowling's books. Besides that, Rowling has often said that if she could rewrite the series, she wouldn't pair up Ron and Hermione. Yet even in alternate universes of The Cursed Child, Ron and Hermione have feelings for each other no matter what. Why would Rowling write that, against her opinions? My theory is that someone else wrote most of the content for The Cursed Child and Rowling only edited.

He made both Albuses cry!Why was Delphi able to stay in the past for so long in Godric's Hollow when the time turner only works for 5 minutes at a time?How come nobody was looking out for potential saboteurs like Albus at the Triwizard Tournament?I refuse to believe Albus and Scorpius stole from Hermione without getting caught, or that Draco just had a Time Turner lying around at his house!If Delphi never went to Hogwarts how did she learn magic?Many plot points felt too easy or made little sense.I loved seeing some of my favorite characters again. I practically hyperventilated when Snape appeared. Draco had a very prominent role as a father and as his own person. We got a unique look at Draco's personality away from the war with Voldemort; in truth he's proud but compassionate and loyal. Draco's definitely not a villain here.Most of the characters acted like themselves - the best example is McGonagall commenting \"I daresay it's my fault for owning a fireplace\" when everyone keeps ruining her carpet with floo powder. It was so lovely to reconnect with those characters again. Some characters however acted nothing like I knew them - Harry was a dick, and Dumbledore was an emotional wreck part of the time. I was very surprised.Cedric was a central point in the Cursed Child. Albus' quest starts with saving Cedric and the book closes with the acceptance of Cedric's death. The simple scene of Harry apologizing at Cedric's grave for getting him killed, for reducing his value to the \"spare\", was in my opinion vital to the Harry Potter series as a whole. The tragedy surrounding Cedric's end was never discussed enough at length in books 4-7. This revisit was necessary for closure.Am I alone in feeling like The Cursed Child didn't read like Rowling's work? Much of the play didn't achieve the plot intricacy and character depth I've always loved in Rowling's books. Besides that, Rowling has often said that if she could rewrite the series, she wouldn't pair up Ron and Hermione. Yet even in alternate universes of The Cursed Child, Ron and Hermione have feelings for each other no matter what. Why would Rowling write that, against her opinions? My theory is that someone else wrote most of the content for The Cursed Child and Rowling only edited. (hide spoiler)]"},

Second of all, this got tragically long, I'm really sorry, and honestly this is just a mess. but so is this play. u reap what u sow xoxo)Ok so first this is a message to harry james potter fans, and them alone. Please, PLEASE, do not make my mistakes, do not read the cursed child. If you love Harry you know that he is the best person that has ever lived and therefore it is clear for everyone he doesn't deserve any of the shit happening in this book. ANY OF IT. And neither do you! He's beautiful, and you're all beautiful, and I'm beautiful, and none of us deserved this. (but especially harry)Now that that's been said, i need to add: if you think this review focuses solely on harry james potter and ignores everything every other character has been through, well, you'd be right. To be perfectly clear, i give zero fucks about other characters. i don't care about their sad lives, i don't care about their feelings and it's perfectly obvious to me that whatever they go through, none of it comes even close to whatever horror harry's living. so, i don't care about albus severus, i certainly don't care about draco malfoy, and i don't particularly care about talking about harry's flaws either, so be sure that i won't. byeANYWAY, i still don't know where to start. i don't know, as a person who has been resentful of her own parents and who is as a result suspicious of parents in general, i don't particularly appreciate this attempt to make harry james potter, my favourite character ever, someone who i've loved for 16 years and who got me through the worst moments of my life when i thought i had nothing else, someone that i've always looked up to, become everything i hate. So, really, thanks for that ! (That still doesn't stop Harry from being the most beautiful person, but still, disgusting)And aside from this personal disgust about the whole thing, i'm pretty sure there are more original ways to tell a story. because of course everyone struggles with the war, and with everything else they've been through, and the kids have to deal with who their parents are, that makes perfect sense to me, but i don't KNOW why this has to be achieved by making harry look like an asshole. i also don't know why we get this whole HARRY IS A BAD FATHER!!!!11\u00a71u0026amp;!u0026amp;! thing when we don't even get the perspective of his other two children, who don't really seem to have a problem with him. maybe they do, but either way, we don't know. why? WHATEVER THIS STORYLINE WASN'T NECESSARY AND I HATE IT. but if it that wasn't enough (of course it wasn't) we then have to deal with harry behaving in ways he actually would never. my first question is WHY on earth is he head of magical law enforcement when 1) he hates the ministry 2) he has always opposed the ministry's decisions 3) he was himself a victim of the ministry and of this same department 4) he witnessed first hand how crap they are 5) WHY!!! WOULD!!! HE!!! WORK!!! FOR!!! THEM!!! AND WHY WOULD HE BE THE BOSS. I know Harry's wanted to be an auror but HE WAS FOURTEEN and in the middle of a war, and obviously i know he always wants to save the world and get the bad guys so they won't hurt anyone else but i just can't see why after the war he would have wanted this to be his daily life, and especially not by working at the ministry. But whatever i've never agreed with this anyway and i'm always going to be angry about it soooo. ok anyway being head of magical law enforcement then turns him into some asshole that threatens people for no valid reason, a person that is literally the opposite of who harry james potter is, but ok. ok. i also can't figure out a way to believe harry would actually threaten his son to spy on him by putting a spell on him to see and hear everything he sees and hears. what the fuck?????? what the fuck. good for you if you want to write harry like this but IT IS NOT HIM and he would never be this person, he was never like this and he has no reason to become this as an adult. NEVER!!!!!! And, on top of it, after i had to read this nonsense with my own eyes, who shows up to offer harry some well-needed parenting advice? DRACO MALFOY. i mean....... i don't actually have words for this. but thanks for making harry look like a loser while everyone around him is so much more sensible and better. I think that's all for BAD DAD HARRY, SHIT DUDE HARRY (no it's not but i don't want to talk about it anymore), but if only that was the only problem. No, because when they finally decide to write Harry as himself (finally indeed), they go back to what's worked so well in books 1 to 7: MAKING. HARRY. SUFFER. So i'll just make a list if you don't mind of all the SHIT (shit is a truly weak word for what he actually gets here) he has to deal with in this exciting play:- harry standing alone in his office, tired, \"the weight of the world upon his shoulders\" tell me something i don't know??????? this is harry james potter at ages 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. LET HIM LIVE- amos diggory shows up to his doorstep in the middle of the night to blame him for cedric's death- his own son, piece of shit son albus severus, mocks him for the abuse he's been through and acts like harry's ever asked any of this to happen to him, or like the world would be better off if harry hadn't been there to save it (an opinion that quickly gets shot down when scorpius stumbles into voldemort lives au. thanks harry for saving the world indeed and pretty much dying doing it)- albus severus also blames him for everyone that died during the war. why not.- this obviously results in harry feeling guilty and blaming himself for everything which, again, i have already read about in the seven previous books- albus severus who has the audacity to say harry \"doesn't care\", spare me with your teenage emo problems buddy, come to my face and tell me that harry, harry james potter, who constantly feels so much about everyone and everything, DOESN'T CARE. - (side note, i find it funny that everyone calls harry whiny during order of the phoenix and blames him for dealing with everything that happens then, when we have here in albus a perfect example of what a whiny person actually is)- harry's scar hurting again after TWENTY TWO YEARS like either he thought he was free of it and now he's not or either there was always a part of him who never totally believed voldemort was really gone, and now he has to be like \"is he. could he be back.\" fun times once more- flashbacks of the dursleys abusing harry in case, again, we haven't seen enough of that before- harry then gets to yell at dumbledore('s portrait) for 5 short seconds about him sending him back to privet drive every year which is like, ABOUT TIME, but of course this part only exists so that harry can forgive dumbledore who is, i quote, \"weeping openly\" and have harry agree to say that love \"blinds people\" and make them make mistakes and that therefore everything dumbledore did is perfectly justified. which then makes harry compare dumbledore sending him to the dursleys, where he was sure to be hated and treated like shit, to himself sending albus to hogwarts, where he was sure to have friends bc HE ALREADY HAD FRIENDS. well, that's not the same, harry is not dumbledore, and i don't see why they have to make him think that. fuck you- harry then being used to say that dumbledore and snape were great men, i don't care how great they were, they wEReN'T, AND I DON'T WANT HARRY TO SAY THAT. i could write pages about forgiveness and i've never had a problem with harry forgiving them but i think there's a difference between forgiving them because that's who he is, because he always forgives, and actually justifying whatever horrible things they did, and i don't see why he always has to be the one justifying it, because if he forgives and justifies it then it almost makes it look ok. BUT IT'S NOT. FUCK OFF.- \"harry is consumed in his grief\" story of his life- another moment where he blames himself and thinks everyone would be better off if he had died like he was \"supposed to\" listen to me harry james potter i don't want to hear this!!!! you didn't do anything wrong!!!! you saved the world!!!! where would they be without you!- and then of course, the whole time turner business brings him back where? October 31st 1981, Godric's Hollow, night of his parents' deaths. excellent.- but not before having to transfigure himself into voldemort!!!!!!!! like nothing that happened to him has been enough, he has to BE voldemort. why??? W H Y. WHAT JUSTIFIES MAKING HIM GO THROUGH THIS. WHAT.- \"it has to be me\" of course it has harry. OF COURSE.- and then....... finally...... we finally reach what seems to have been the purpose of this whole play..... order has been restored, the world has been saved, they fought evil and won, all of this for what????? yes, to stand there and watch lily and james die. Yay ! - before actually seeing this tho he also has to see voldemort actually ALIVE, which is a great moment for him. i'm pretty sure this figures in his top 5 things he wanted most in his life, 23 years after his death- ginny is like \"you don't have to watch\" thank you ginny, but SADLY \"i'm letting it happen, of course i have to watch\" NO, YOU DON'T, YOU BLOODY FOOL, YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT JUSTIFIES DOING THIS TO YOURSELF. HARRY, I LOVE YOU, DON'T DO IT--- but no. he does. because having to relive his parents' murder in memories and nightmares or whenever a dementor comes close to him apparently was NOT enough, no, what he clearly was missing from his life was to witness it as a 40 year-old man. cool. just cool. - allow me to quote the exact second where he sees lily die : \"and it's like lightning passes through harry's body, he's sent to the floor, a pure mess of grief\"- ............................- ............................- ............................Why ????????? WHO. Who thought this was great. What was this person's thought process? \"Hey you know what i think? harry hasn't suffered enough in his life, i think what's missing is that he should be there in godric's hollow in 1981, to see his parents die, right? he totally deserves this.\"- i don't know. i don't understand this play. if i wanted to see harry suffer well i already had 7 books of it, 7 books where his life constantly gets worse, and whatever rare moments of joy (i can't even say happiness, when has this kid ever been happy?) he gets are soon replaced by moments of horror. the books end with an epilogue that make it look like harry gets to live and to be happy, but 9 years later, we find out that that's actually not the case? why doesn't his suffering ever end? obviously i know that given what he's been through he's always gonna have nightmares and he's gonna carry his scars with him and he's never gonna forget but does it have to be all he gets?? i know he's always gonna live through some painful moments ok bc he's human and we all have to go through painful moments, and the pain doesn't stop just because he's defeated voldemort and saved the world, but my question is: do we really need to see it??? what does this bring to his story ? is it character development to see him go through the same things over and over again ? is it narratively satisfying?? like, of course he feels guilty, he's always felt guilty, i know he feels guilty, i don't have to be told about how often he goes see cedric's grave to say he's sorry to know just how sorry he feels. did i mention i've loved him for 16 years ? i know very well he blames himself for everything, he feels everything is his fault and he feels personally responsible for every person he couldn't save, and while i very much love him for it, because he cares so much, because of everything he is, i actually don't want to see it. i've already seen it. i know he's sad. but i love him, and i want him to see him happy. i deserve to see him happy, and he deserves to be. contrary to popular belief stories don't have to be awful all the time. that's not what makes a story good or worth telling. at the very least, it is all sorts of terrible and disgusting to use BAD DAD HARRY as a PLOT DEVICE just to make him go through horrible things, again. the reason any of it happens is because of albus and harry's relationship. this story wasn't necessary. there were plenty of stories about harry to tell, that respected him as a person and as a character, that didn't make light of what happened to him but that also allowed him and us to see beyond it. i for one would have very much liked to see harry happy, struggling sometimes and feeling sad occasionally but still being happy, someone who is still very much caring for others, helping other people, and making the world a better place. because that's who harry is, and there were much better stories than him being a shit ass auror, a shit ass dad, because we've always known him as such a good person, and even in this horrible play, that's still what comes through, how much he cares, how much he wants to save everyone, because you can't take that away from him no matter how much you try your hardest to make him look like he's not as great as an adult as he was a kid. Ginny even says at some point that everyone sees him as The Hero, but that they fail to see how he's been heroic in quiet ways, and i think that's true, and i think focusing on that would have been better, not some grand epic hero moment where he defeats evil, because he's already done that, but just moments of his every day life where he saves the world one day at a time, one person at a time, quietly, just by helping people and making the world better. But i suppose doing that would involve being a good writer, and no one involved in this play has proven to be one.Of course, even if you focus on something in this play other than harry, though i don't see why you would, you'll realise that it is still super shit. The storyline itself, if it can even be called that, shows no originality as 1) the books have dealt with time travel before 2) let alone characters who are not who they say they are 3) i've read fics like this a thousand times before as well, as if no one has ever had the idea to make voldemort and bellatrix have a secret baby, and now we're supposed to act like this is just magnificently written and plotted. (The fics were actually better, not sorry to say, bc none of them treated harry like this.) Well, it's not, it's stupid, it is not a good story, and everyone who has the audacity to act like this is incredible and excellent storytelling frankly needs to read better books. And the play doesn't even really have a resolution. Where do Albus and Harry go from here? What do James and Lily think of the whole thing? IS HARRY GONNA BE HAPPY ONE DAY ? Not to mention it is laughable that the whole story is sort of about albus and scorpius' friendship, with some moments between them worthy of the angstiest romance novels i've ever read, only to end with scorpius asking rose out. we get it, everyone is a straight, but that adds nothing to the story and is only just another example of a boy randomly wanting a girl who doesn't want anything to do with him. And they're FOURTEEN. And why did draco randomly replace ron as harry's best friend, ron was just there to make jokes and everything happened without him, and even as someone who has definitely not been his greatest fan, i can tell you he deserved much much better. who would have thought that in the year 2016 ron weasley would be the newest victim of the drarries. everything happens i guess. and why do we have to care about draco's feelings for that matter i wish i knew (PS: special mention to severus snape basically requoting a kingdom or this to albus and scorpius. truly iconic)i don't know what else to say. this was terrible and disappointing in every possible way. The best part was ron and hermione, so i guess there will be at least one group of people satisfied with this. Good for them. But i'm just angry that Harry Potter, as a character and as a series, has meant so much to me for so long, only to end like this, for no valid reason. like deathly hallows actually ended with hope (and im not counting the epilogue), it was about harry finally being free of voldemort and the war and of course horrible things happened because it was a war and people died, and it was going to take them time to deal with this, but harry was seventeen, and he had his whole life before him, and you could feel he was going to be ok (the book literally ends with the words ALL WAS WELL). and now we're here, he's 20 years older, but he's not ok, it almost seems like no time has passed, and it almost seems like he's gonna be stuck like this forever. and even if you wanted to play the bad father harry card, there was no need for this story, like you could just introduce that harry and albus had a bad relationship, whatever, and then they could have spent the whole play fighting to make it better, to talk to each other and to learn and to become better together, but no, instead nonsense happens and we end with one shit conversation about how dumbledore and snape were great men and we're supposed to believe that they're gonna be ok after this. that is of course until jkr decides she isn't done with harry's story at all, and writes another sequel where albus murders harry in 20 more years because it turns out their relationship never became better at all. who knows? i wouldn't put it past her. idk i just really don't know what to say, no one needed this, the last book came out in 2007, which is almost 10 years ago, and we didn't feel such a hole in our lives that a sequel had to be written and especially such a shitty one. I DON'T KNOW. i just don't understand. there are just so many ways to write something good but instead it seems like they just took the easy way and wrote straight up nonsense because they knew the fans would eat it up and buy the fucking books no matter what. well, as a fan: fuck you! and by the way, when you write something for money and not because you actually care about the characters, or that you have a specific story about them you need and want to tell, everybody can see it.(PS: if JKR doesn't want to write the story where Harry dismantles the oppressive system of the wizarding world that has allowed the ministry to be the shit that it's always been, i will, and in the meantime i will let harry take a well deserved break on a beautiful beach with his beautiful boyfriend. xoxo)To finish put an end to this horrific review (i'm so sorry) let me just say that i love my darling Harry, i don't care if he's fictional and i shouldn't love him this much, he's always been the realest and the most important for me, he means the world to me and he has saved my life in more ways than one. Even through this pile of shit he remains everything he's always been, the hero he's always been but also so much more than that; always so brave, always so ready to help people, always ready to do something horrible so that someone else doesn't have to, always blaming himself so people won't blame themselves, always trying to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders so that no one else will have to, always worrying over everyone even when no one really actually worries about him, and pretending he's fine so people won't worry, always kind, always trying to be better no matter what, always struggling with many things but still trying to overcome it, always trying so much, and always seeing the best in people, even when they don't deserve it, constantly hilarious, prince of freedom, and always and still such a good and beautiful person. So, Harry, my love, happy birthday, you are the light of the world, i love you all the time and always, and thank you for everything."},

Clearly I felt it had some! The development of one character from the old Harry Potter world in particular was incredible and was easily my favorite part of the whole play. But piss-poor development of the other characters in this story was what caused frustration for me. The person in this play was not the Harry James Potter I adore. And that's just something I couldn't get over. Also, Snape is not nor will he ever be a hero. He is an abuser. Naming his son Albus Severus was something Harry did that I have never gotten over. And I will tell you this play did NOT make me feel better about how we are supposed to view Snape. A man who abuses children for no reason is not a hero. And he does what he does out of obsession, not love. He has no noble cause, and he is not a good man. And the way this play discussed abuse and how Harry should respond to that abuse was super not great.That's all I will add in this review for now. Honestly it was overall a fairly disappointing play, and much like everything else we have learned about the wizarding world outside of the original seven books, I do not accept this story as canon. Much more to come in a video review later. "},

I sat there and just READ IT. I couldn't put it down. I FLEW through it in a couple hours and it was the most epic few hours ever.   \"Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\"     FEELS    First  Go into this with an open mind to fully enjoy it. It takes a little getting used to with the formatting and how it sometimes in the beginning jumped scene to scene. It's a PLAY. Although I read it like a normal book. I didn't picture a stage or anything like that. I was at Hogwarts and all the amazing places this story took us. And I was there with friends who've I've been waiting to fully meet for years like Scorpius and Albus..then I was there with people who have been in my life for years that I grew up with like Harry, Ron and Hermione. Jumping back into this world was such a joy and was like being wrapped up in a warm fuzzy blanket you loved all your life.   \"Those that we love never truly leave us, Harry. There are things that death cannot touch. Paint..and memory..and love.\"    Another thing:  Remember. The characterization might seem a little strange at first but we left our favorites when they were 17 years old. They are ADULTS NOW. And we have some missing years which is up to us to fill in, in our own heads. Honestly it didn't bother me at all because they're still THEM. Harry is still heroic, Ron is still funny, and Hermione is still super smart. They're the same, just OLDER.   \"They were great men with huge flaws, and you know what- those flaws always made them greater.\"    One last tip:  I read this like fanfiction. At times it seriously felt like the best fanfiction I've ever read..and I've read a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction! Or read it like a script. And just ENJOY IT!!! Enjoy being back in the most magical places in the world. Enjoy being with your old friends and catching up with their lives. Because  it's truly something magical and special being back in this world.    \"People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are- and have always been- heroic in the really quiet ways.\"   It's the story we've all be waiting for and its EVERYTHING. This picks up directly after the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. With Albus going off to Hogwarts and its his journey through mostly the 4th year of Hogwarts for him. And all the adventure it comes with. There's a lot of character development too and family bonding and friendship. Albus befriends Scorpius Malfoy. And Albus goes through a tough time being known as \"Harry Potters son.\" They have a pretty rocky relationship and it brings a huge turning point. There are SO many plot twists and a lot of old friends we get to see again. This book drags you through ALL OF THE EMOTIONS AND FEELS. I was a sobbing mess reading a lot of this!!! So read with tissues!!   \"Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We've been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we've blighted their present.\"   If you love Harry Potter, you need to read this. Especially if you loved Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire!! I don't want to give up too much of the plot because I knew absolutely nothing going into it and I loved it. I really hope the play eventually comes to America and I'm always hoping we get more BOOKS!! Because I am never ready to leave Hogwarts fully!! Always remember though..   \"Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.\"   *weeps into eternity*"},

I had hoped that this book would redeem that chapter, and in that aspect, The Cursed Child was most definitely successful.If you have not yet read the book and you intend to do so, PLEASE do not read the rest of this review! I do not want to spoil anything for you! ************************************** The Cursed Child is a screenplay, it is a script, not a novel. The stage directions, accompanied with my imagination, made reading this quite easy. I had no difficulty getting into the story. The story itself follows Albus Severus through his first few years at Hogwarts at a fast-pace. Albus does not feel he fits in with his family, his relationship with his father in particular is tumultuous. Albus\u2019 best friend is Scorpius, the child of Draco Malfoy. At Hogwarts, the two are bullied and teased relentlessly. For Albus and Scorpius, Hogwarts is not home. When Amos Diggory shows up at the Potter house, Albus overhears a conversation between Amos and Harry, where Amos appeals to Harry to use a Time Turner salvaged from the Department of Mysteries to go back in time to save Cedric Diggory. Harry denies. Albus overhears and decides to take matters into his own hands, and is aided by Delphi Diggory, Amos\u2019 niece. I do not like time travel. I\u2019m not sure if I think it\u2019s stupid, or I\u2019m just too stupid to be able to wrap my head around the logistics. I think it has more to do with the notion of revisiting the past more than once. I find that whole concept tired and repetitive and I just do not like it. I was ok with the Time Turner use in Prisoner of Azkaban, and I think that was because they just went back once. It didn\u2019t feel tedious. However, I think bringing back a storyline motivated by Time Turner use, is a regurgitation, I felt like it was a cop out. Don't get me wrong, I liked how it took us back to be able to see the Triwizard Tournament, and even Godric's Hollow, and Hagrid (OH HAGRID), and these sort of alternate-universes. But it also felt a little too much like Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is fan fiction. I have nothing against fan fiction, but I was looking forward to original Harry Potter. I\u2019m aware a lot changes in 19 years (it\u2019s actually closer to 22 years because of how fast-paced the timeline is), regardless, this story did not feel completely like Harry Potter. To an extent, this is perfectly ok, because this is about the younger generation living in a post-Voldemort era. However, I did not particularly enjoy the focus on the younger generation. Albus is Harry and Ginny\u2019s son so I obviously care about him, but the scenes with snippets of older-Harry and the palpable guilt that haunts him, were my favourite parts of the story.My problem with the Deathly Hallows\u2019 Nineteen Years Later chapter was that everything was wrapped up so conveniently, as though everything was suddenly hunky-dory in the wizarding world now that old Voldy had been off\u2019ed. Although The Cursed Child didn\u2019t address the bigger world issues of classism (/blood-status-ism/house-ism ??) and speciesism, I wholeheartedly appreciate the way it approached Harry\u2019s guilt.  HARRY: I shouldn\u2019t have survived \u2014 it was my destiny to die \u2014 even Dumbledore thought so \u2014 and yet I lived. I beat Voldemort. All these people \u2014 all these people \u2014 my parents, Fred, the Fallen Fifty \u2014 and it\u2019s me that gets to live? How is that? All this damage \u2014 and it\u2019s my fault. I liked that we were able to see Harry\u2019s struggle with being a father, largely due to his limited familial relationships. We bear witness to the aftermath of his relationship with Dumbledore, and the impact that had upon him. The scene with Harry revisiting his past with Dumbledore\u2019s portrait brought tears to my eyes. \u201cDUMBLEDORE: No. I was protecting you. I did not want to hurt you . . .DUMBLEDORE attempts to reach out of the portrait \u2014 but he can\u2019t. He begins to cry but tries to hide it.But I had to meet you in the end . . . eleven years old, and you were so brave. So good. You walked uncomplainingly along the path that had been laid at your feet. Of course I loved you . . . and I knew that it would happen all over again . . . that where I loved, I would cause irreparable damage. I am no fit person to love . . . I have never loved without causing harm.\u201dDespite how immensely satisfying this was, I wanted more. I wanted to see:- If Arthur was any closer to understanding batteries, - How Molly was as an overbearing, well-meaning grandmother,- Bill and Fleur handling full-moons,- Percy working under Hermione at the Ministry (??),- GEORGE, my baby George, unable to cope with the loss of his brother; distanced from the smiling, laughing, prankster we love,- Hagrid and Grawp and Olympe working as giant-activists, not for the purpose of trying to gain allies, but to help better their ways of life,- Luna being Luna proving the existence of Crumple-Horned Snorkack's and starting a conservatory for them in Sweden,- Neville with his grandmother who has grown so so so proud of her only grandson, and Neville with his parents, Neville teaching his students about Mimbulus Mimbletonia smiling to himself as he remembers dousing everyone in Stinksap in their Hogwarts Express compartment,- Parvati Patil who still meets with Sybil Trelawney for tea every few months and afterwards they both cry as they remember their best friend and favourite student who they were unable to save during the Battle of Hogwarts, - Teddy Lupin growing up without his parents, but with a loving grandmother and loving godparents and cousin, who feels like he has no right to be sad, but he thinks about the persecution his father faced for being a werewolf, and the persecution his mother faced for simply falling in love and he can\u2019t help but feel sad, and all the werewolves are underground and they don\u2019t lead normal lives, and that could have been him but he was lucky but he doesn\u2019t feel lucky \u2026 - Kreacher who still works in the Hogwarts kitchens who sometimes cleans the Slytherin dorms (even though House Elves are no longer supposed to clean up after humans, the humans are supposed to clean up after themselves) and sometimes sees Albus and Scorpius who have fallen asleep over stacks of Potions homework in the common room so he props pillows under their heads as Regulus\u2019 locket slips out from the top of his tea cozy and lightly grazes Scorpius\u2019 head. - Sirius Black\u2019s name cleared, reform in the Ministry legislature that works to prevent unjust incarceration, a bill passed in his name to appeal sentences and provides fair trials for people accused of committing crimes, the House of Black used as a group home, it's a sanctuary, it's a place of safety, for children/youth who have no families, it's more than an orphanage, it's a place of opportunity. I think you get the point. I wanted more. I do understand that since this is a play, having such a large cast to incorporate these characters and their lives post-Voldemort, would be especially challenging. I really don't care about the execution challenges, it doesn\u2019t stop me from wishing. Very briefly I want to talk about Albus. I\u2019m disappointed in his character; the pressure he feels associated with his family name is completely understandable. What I don\u2019t understand and what I simply CANNOT believe is that his family, siblings, cousins - the Potters' entire NETWORK of people wouldn\u2019t do everything possible to protect Albus. This is a different generation, yes, but Albus' siblings and cousins have parental figures in Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Ginny. You cannot possibly expect me to believe that Albus would not have cousins or siblings who would defend his ass from the petty likes of Polly Chapman? You can\u2019t possibly expect me to believe that JAMES SIRIUS POTTER would stand by as his BROTHER was relentlessly bullied, and CALLED A SQUIB? I don\u2019t buy it. You can't possibly expect me to believe that ROSE GRANGER-WEASLEY would be a bratty, narcisstic schoolgirl who wouldn't defend her cousin? Perhaps this is my fault for having such unwavering faith in the trio. I can't believe for one second that they wouldn't have raised their children to always look out for one another. This could be me holding them to too high of a standard, I understand parenting is hard work. But then again, you can\u2019t possibly expect me to believe that PROFESSOR LONGBOTTOM would even tolerate such behaviour. NEVILLE, who was relentlessly bullied by both his peers and staff would NEVER allow his own students to torment one another. Even Headmistress McGonagall? Bullying tolerated under her authority? You can't even try convincing me that the bullying of Albus (and Scorpius) wouldn't even be on her radar, she has more important things to worry about as Headmistress? Nope. No there is NO fucking way. Not McGonagall. Please don\u2019t get me started on the absurdity that is Bellatrix Lestrange hooking up with Voldemort. (Caidyn's Review goes into fantastic detail about why this seems implausible). But I just can\u2019t even go into detail with that nonsense, it'll get me too wound up I will probably end up stabbing myself with shards of my tangible disappointment. "},

Is it fair to compare the feel of how a car drives to a van? Or a yak to an aardvark? I mean, apples and oranges, right? You might like both, or dislike both, but, they\u2019re different. With that in mind, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to rate The Cursed Child. Lines of dialogue that fell flat on the page might have popped on stage when delivered by a charismatic performer. Scenery and special effects might have added color and tension to a confrontation that seemed a bit tame. Two actors emoting for all their hearts are worth might imbue simple lines with the emotion that transcends what\u2019s written on the page. In other words, as a performance vehicle, The Cursed Child might be stellar. As a pure reading experience, it\u2019s\u2026well, it\u2019s no apple. Or novel, for that matter.So, I\u2019m left to evaluate it solely for the content of its story, rather than quality of its language or descriptions, realizing that the story was very deliberately framed for staging. And, as a story in the HP canon\u2026well, it\u2019s no apple. There\u2019s some delight to be derived from checking in with old, dear friends some years after we last saw them, especially since they\u2019re fictional characters, which means they\u2019re not stricken with the issues that plague, say, a reunion show for a beloved sitcom, where the ravages of time and the fickle finger of (mis)fortune is apparent on the faces (and bodies) of at least some of the stars, unless they are John Stamos, in which case they appear as they always have, with the possible exception that, if possible, their hair looks even better (if I had Stamos\u2019s hair, I\u2019m convinced that I could be elected Supreme Emperor of Earth; it\u2019s that good). Ron Weasley in particular seems to be in this frame of mind, dropping in for some one-dimensional one-liner comic relief here and there, the beloved yet befuddled uncle who\u2019s never quite sure what\u2019s going on around him. The overall tenor and tone, however, is far more serious, and I\u2019m grappling with mixed emotions on that front. On the one hand, one thing I (and millions of other people) loved so much about the HP books is that they made for the perfect escape from the mundane\u2014even when they got dark, you were magically transported to another world, one where magic ruled, where Quidditch was a thing, and where butterbeer could be consumed in mass quantities. On the other\u2026I didn\u2019t grow up with Harry and friends\u2014I was 22 when I discovered the series (which was right around when Goblet of Fire came out, I think), and I was well into my dotage (read: my later twenties) when subsequent volumes arrived, so I didn\u2019t experience the trials and tribulations of adolescence alongside the characters (I did that in the sanctity of my room all by myself, albeit with the help of Tecmo Bowl, the X-Men, and pictures of Kathy Ireland). Still, I was close enough to the age group that did go through that experience to see how easy it would have been to feel like Harry, Hermione, and Ron were akin to real, live, in-the-flesh friends. And, for those people\u2014many of whom are now, themselves, raising children, albeit perhaps slightly younger than Albus and Scorpius\u2014I would imagine there are powerful emotions involved in seeing those friends confronting the same challenges that being a parent entails. And there\u2019s something in seeing fictional characters to whom you\u2019re so attached that, in an odd way, validates and informs your own life experience as much as seeing a close friend go through it might (or even, perhaps, experiencing it yourself).This is a phenomenon unique to addicted readers with avid imaginations, but the power of JK Rowling\u2019s drug is such that she created a generation of junkies who will, I suspect, either fiercely embrace or strongly reject the experience of seeing Harry Potter, boy wizard, the one who defeated He Who Must Not Be Named, struggling to connect with his son in the most mundane ways.Parents were, as often as not, defined as much by their absence as their presence in the HP books (notwithstanding the Weasleys, who, as with Ron in The Cursed Child, resembled nothing so much as the sprawling family from an 80s sitcom family\u2014think the Cosbys or the Seavers with wands), and to have Harry, as a parent, be so simultaneously present and absent is a conundrum. It makes sense, of course, that the boy who grew up without parents, whose father figure was simultaneously his hero and a man he could never fully trust, would struggle as a father himself; but seeing that play out on the page is heartbreaking. Fiction can, and often does, reflect the most real and painful parts of life back at us, and when we seek it out for that purpose, it can be a fulfilling and validating experience in a way few others can. When we seek escapism and magic and adventure, however, and are faced with the overwhelming reality of emotional turmoil\u2026well, it\u2019s disconcerting.Putting aside the staging aspects and judging this solely on the merits of the words printed on the page, as a rip-roaring HP yarn, this is somewhere in 2.5-star territory. As an exploration of how difficult it is to raise a child, no matter how good you might be at the rest of the game of life, and how emotionally eviscerating failing to connect with a tiny human that you made can be, we\u2019ll put in 3.5-star territory.I will, undoubtedly, reread the 7 core HP novels many times in my life (as I already have). Will I reread The Cursed Child? Probably not.Unless, that is, I\u2019m reading it with my kids, in order to stay connected with them and attuned to what they\u2019re feeling and experiencing as they grow and change\u2014something Harry would, by play\u2019s end, appreciate, I think."},

To me, Harry's story ended within the last page of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.   The rest of the review contains spoilers for the original series and mild spoilers for Harry Potter and the Cursed ChildNow, let's analyse the play together, since I am still pretty confused by a lot of things.\u2022 Harry's children. And no, I'm not talking about Albus, who will get a paragraph of his own, but about James and Lily. Sorry, what did you say? You found two personalities lying on the floor? Well, they must be theirs then, since they had none. What is even the purpose of James, besides annoying Albus all the time and being a clone of young James Potter Senior? \u2022 Albus Severus Potter. I just, I DON'T KNOW. Did I like him? I think I mostly liked the concept of him, the idea that he had been (view spoiler)[sorted into Slytherin (hide spoiler)] and that he was so much different from both his siblings and his parents. To Albus, Hogwarts wasn't the amazing place of friendship and adventure that it had been to his father. It was just school. There was homework to do, and there were bullies, and gossip, and rumors. And, constantly behind him, his father's shadow. I mean, I still think Albus seriously needs to get over himself, because he has the worst case of daddy issues I've ever witnessed, but that's somehow understandable. And he was still the only likable Potter in the whole play...\u2022 Harry. I mean, what? Seriously. WHAT? Disclaimer: adult Harry Potter is an asshole. I wasn't n. 1 Harry Stan in the original series either, but here he's just... oblivious, insensitive, horribly self-centered. Childish. Albus is a teenager, a child, but Harry seems to completely fail to understand this. He's overbearing, doesn't get his son at all, and just wants him to be a copy of himself, or - even worse - to \"be more like James and Lily.\" He doesn't see him. And the end of the play doesn't change my opinion on this matter: Harry does not know his son. \u2022 Scorpius My Actual Son Malfoy. I'm sure we can all agree that he needs to be protected at all costs. All right, he's the least Malfoy person on earth, but he's still pretty adorable and dorky. I mean, who would've expected Draco's son to be a cute nerd? Well, not me, that's for sure. Still, even though I really liked Scorpius, his characterization is not canon for me. That's not my Scorpius Malfoy. I've always had a fascination with the more grey characters in the Harry Potter series, like Draco, and I like to think that Scorpius has some of that darkness in him, some of that selfishness, and ambition, but also the same fierce loyalty that Draco showed to his family during the war. To me, \"Malfoy\" and \"cute\" don't belong in the same sentence but, after all, Scorpius is still the reason why this play got an extra star. \u2022 Ron and Hermione. Again, what the hell? I know that, even in the original series, Ron represents the comic relief. However, that doesn't necessarily make him an utter moron. He was absolutely incompetent, and his complete inability to do anything at all besides making inappropriate jokes seemed to also have the purpose to make Hermione look more wonderful in comparison. However, this Hermione was... not Hermione at all. I only saw a glimpse of her in her interactions with Harry, but for the rest of the time, she was just a character with her name and a completely different personality. \u2022 Draco. MY BEAUTIFUL DRACO. Yes, I am one of those people, and I absolutely adore Draco Malfoy. Here we saw a softer version of him, a different version, but honestly - who cares. I just needed to see more of him. *blows kisses* *swoons*\u2022 I don't want to talk about the plot. It's fucking embarrassing how bad it is. Sometimes I even found the plot in the original series too convoluted and unrealistic, but this time it was just plainly nonsensical. Albus' reasons for doing things made no sense to me. (view spoiler)[And really, Voldemort has an evil daughter? What is even the point of that? And why does being Voldemort's child necessarily make her evil? She didn't grow up with her parents. She could've been a totally different person, her own person, but she was a cardboard villain instead, with ridiculous motives. (hide spoiler)]\u2022 The thing I liked the most, besides my beloved Malfoys, was (view spoiler)[the alternate universe in which Scorpius Malfoy was the Scorpion King.

Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\u201dOn July 31, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a new play based on a story by Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany premiered at the Palace Theatre in London\u2019s West End. The play, along with a book publication of its script, is the first significant addition to the Potter universe since the credits rolled on the second Deathly Hallows movie in 2011. Harry Potter stands peerless in the realm of literary hits, so Cursed Child was an assured commercial success even before it debuted. Written as a transcript, Cursed Child follows the next generation of wizards and witches.I found the latest installment of the Harry Potter series to be an enjoyable read in the sense that it allowed me to revisit old friends made many years ago (even if only for an afternoon). Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reignited that childlike imaginative spark in me, which is the reason I fell in love with the world of Hogwarts in the first place. Without going into too much detail, the play focuses on the difficulty Harry and Ginny's son, Albus Severus, has with being the underperforming child of the \"the boy who lived\". Albus struggles with living up to the reputation of the Potter name, and subsequently becomes a bit of a loner who does not hold the same esteem for Hogwarts as his parents would have hoped. The piece also speaks to the difficulty Harry has parenting a somewhat rebellious Albus, who is often viewed by others to be \"different\". When Albus befriends the child of a certain former Slytherin house member with whom Harry shared several altercations with during his time at Hogwarts, Harry is tasked with determining whether he should intervene to keep Albus out of trouble, or rather to put his preconceived notions of Malfoy's only son aside and allow Albus to continue to spend time with his one true friend. In addition, Harry must also make Albus understand the difference between seeking out trouble versus confronting it when it presents itself to you \u2013a lesson Albus eventually learns throughout the course of the play.  SCORPIUS: No, it\u2019s time that time-turning became a thing of the past.ALBUS: You\u2019re quite proud of that phrase, aren\u2019t you?SCORPIUS: Been working on it all day.While many readers have voiced their concerns over the writing style and how it pales in comparison to the original series, I would offer the following point. This work is written in such a style to facilitate live performances. As such, it seems unfair to compare the extent to which characters are developed and the overall plot complexity to J.K. Rowling's original series. The original seven were not bound by the added task of producing a narrative which can easily be digested in a spoken format (in addition to proving itself worthy of the original series as a standalone literary text). As I have always preferred dialogue over description, this writing form has been proven itself worthy due to its easy and fast nature to read. I truly don\u2019t understand what's become of J.K. Rowling in recent years. She transformed the literary and cinematic realms with her Potter books, pioneering fantasy trends that continue to this day. I suppose she's trying to make stage plays more popular now? Not sure if that will take off, and it's kind of unfair for the many fans who can't afford to go see the play themselves. Those people are stuck with reading the script, which requires a lot more imagination to really enjoy. There's very little of Rowling's great descriptive prose on display, mostly just dialogue - and it's unclear how much of that was actually written word-for-word by her personally. It sounds like her style; I'll say that. But reading it definitely pales in comparison to reading an actual book. Frankly, I'm disappointed that Rowling hasn't taken the time to flesh this out into a novel. The same goes for the other Potter-related fiction she's written lately - the pre-Fantastic-Beasts pieces on Pottermore, to be precise. It's like reading pitches she hasn't bothered to turn into real books. Obviously, when you're as famous as Rowling, you can get away with posting your world-building notes online or having somebody else turn a story idea into a script and still have millions reading the stuff... but it smacks of laziness on her part, in my opinion.  DUMBLEDORE: Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic.If you came to this book hoping for a new era of Harry Potter, you're going to be disappointed. This book is an epilogue to the original series, not the start of a new one. There's nothing ground-breaking. The mythology is not expanded, and the new characters spend most of their time dealing with the legacies of the original cast. I'm gratified that the wizarding world will be built up by the Fantastic Beasts film(s), but there's a lot of untapped potential in the modern Potterverse that isn't even touched in \"Cursed Child\". There wasn\u2019t enough of Hogwarts, unfortunately, and only focused on the magic outside the castle. I would have liked to see more of the home Harry Potter grew up in. What makes \"Cursed Child\" work despite all the strikes against it is what it does with the aftermath of the original stories. If \"Deathly Hallows\" had to have a follow-up in the first place, then this is a surprisingly good one. It's certainly an improvement on the frequently-criticized, rushed epilogue to \"Hallows\". This is basically an expansion of that last chapter, exploring what it's like for Albus Potter to grow up dealing with his famous dad's legacy, and it's very believable in that respect. True, Albus doesn't come across as likable until near the end of the book, and even Harry shows some striking flaws as a father, but given where both these characters are coming from, these problems make sense. It's not the forced \"happily ever after\" of the Hallows epilogue; it's complex and realistic. Additionally, there's a very sympathetic, funny character in play in the form of Scorpius Malfoy, Draco's son. He ends up stealing the show, and is arguably the hero of the story in his own right. His lines made me laugh out loud more than once, and convinced me that to whatever degree Rowling was involved in writing this story, she's clearly still \"got it\".  ALBUS: \"So what would you like me to do? Magic myself popular? Conjure myself into a new house? Transfigure myself into a better student? Just cast a spell, Dad, and change me into what you want me to be, okay? It'll work better for both of us.\"Scorpius was great addition into the story. His friendship/relationship with Albus was pure, and I appreciate the attention provided towards the importance of friendship. I definitely understand why people would like to see them together as the dialogue and quick descriptions indicate a relationship, which ultimately seems to be more than friendship. Draco and Harry talking, and viewing each other as friends made me feel emotional; it took them more than twenty years, but it was worth it. I still don\u2019t understand the story surrounding Draco and his wife, Astoria. It doesn\u2019t make sense, and seems like bullshit the writers created to expand the plot/story. Parts of the story itself felt a little overdone and rushed, but you must keep in mind that this addition is originally intended to be watched, not read, with delivery fitting under a specific window of time. For this, I know I did not experience the full breath and absorption of Cursed Child during my read-through, and I am sure live-performance characteristics such as dialectic nuances and set transformations would definitely expand this work even more, but just reading the play itself took me back into this world of magic, mishap, and mischievousness that Potterheads are long-time familiar with. I am curious how the experience of watching it live differs, and cannot wait to see it when I have the chance.  DUMBLEDORE: \"Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\"The Trolley Witch part made me feel uneasy. It was irrelevant towards the plot, and made me cringe while reading it. I\u2019ve come to a conclusion, in which I cannot consider these events cannon. As much as I enjoy certain twists and additions into the story, much of it doesn\u2019t fit with the original Harry Potter books or does not seem to work. It felt as if the plot read like fan fiction, with its revisiting of the original novels\u2019 plot points, its cameos of beloved characters, and its too-satisfying outcomes; Hermione, for instance, is Minister for Magic and Ginny is the sports editor for the Daily Prophet. Ron seems completely out of character, and revealed he was drunk at his wedding; there was a desperate attempt of humor with his character, which didn\u2019t seem like the original Ron. Voldenmort having a child completely turned me off. He has been hinted to have a relationship with Bellatrix throughout the books, but them having an actual affair and child doesn\u2019t seem to fit. How could Bellatrix be pregnant during the Wizarding War? There was no explanation for this, only the child was born during this time. Of course, their child would want to avenge them, and bring Voldemort back. Another villain would have improved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child as Voldemort\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t do the book any justice. I will not accept that Voldemort had a child with Bellatrix. I can\u2019t, and I won\u2019t.   HARRY: \"I shouldn't have survived \u2014 it was my destiny to die \u2014 even Dumbledore thought so \u2014 and yet I lived. I beat Voldemort. All these people \u2014 all these people \u2014 my parents, Fred, the Fallen Fifty \u2014 and it's me that gets to live? How is that? All this damage \u2014 and it's my fault.\"It's a shame because there's a lot of possibility here. There are interesting storylines taking place here, they just aren't executed on the level we've come to expect from a Rowling product. I enjoy reading time travelling stories, as well as revisiting beloved characters much later in life, but this isn't how these characters act. Albus should never have been this whiny. I liked him in the seventh book. I liked Harry in the original 7. But, here, the characters have become annoying or flat. Additionally, I wasn't a fan of how entwined in the story Harry was. I've already witnessed him and everything he's capable of in the original seven books. Now, he's a blubbering fool. You can't sit there and tell me that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, is going to run to Ginny every time he has a minor problem, and he is not allowed to eat sugar.Having said that, as a reader, you have time to appreciate on the page how nimbly Thorne\u2019s writing navigates the adventure\u2019s death-defying twists and turns, and his stage directions have a poetry of their own, a style that in its lyricism and sense of the abstract is distinct from Rowling\u2019s more direct, story-driven prose.For example, when Albus arrives at Hogwarts and is sorted into his school house, we are told: \u201cThere\u2019s a silence. A perfect, profound silence. One that sits low, twists a bit and has damage within it.\u201d  When the children travel in time, Thorne\u2019s stage direction notes how: \u201ctime stops. And then it turns over, thinks a bit, and begins spooling backwards\u2026\u201d   DRACO: \"... And being alone \u2014 that's so hard. I was alone. And it sent me to a truly dark place. For a long time. Tom Riddle was also a lonely child. You may not understand that, Harry, but I do ...\"As a story containing many possible alternate realities, with a text created to varying degrees by three collaborators, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a complement to Rowling\u2019s original series rather than a straightforward continuation. It won\u2019t satisfy all fans: some have already taken issue with the story\u2019s extensive reliance on time travel, the use of which seems to disagree with the magical precedent set in the books. Others have quibbled with the portrayal of Harry\u2019s character: he comes across as pricklier and even more troubled than he was in Rowling\u2019s books.  And though the release is eagerly anticipated by adult fans who grew up with the books, it remains to be seen whether children will connect with reading a complex story in a less familiar script form.The emotional climax is devastating even on paper. Once again, the fantasy world that Rowling created nearly 20 years ago is at its most powerful when it sets aside magic and reveals the basic, brutal and human mechanics of love and grief. The characters are, mostly, exactly as you remember them, and it\u2019s difficult to overstate how exciting it is to read a new story set in this widely loved fantasy universe. The thrill of a new Harry Potter book, even in script form, is its own kind of magic spell.  HARRY: \"You know what? I'm done being made responsible for your unhappiness. At least you've got a dad. Because I didn't, okay?\"Nonetheless, there is still plenty in this new release to tempt fans, for familiarities abound and the magic is intact, if fleeting. Details are minimal for settings, as can be expected given the format, but it works, as there was an assumption that anyone reading the book knows the world inside and out and can paint the pictures in the mind. In fact, fans will find much that is recognizable in the new story, in spite of the altered vessel of delivery. It is worth noting that there is no effort made by either Rowling or Thorne to acquaint a Harry Potter newcomer to the world, so it is advised for those not familiar with the original series to read the books in sequence. From the opening lines \u2014 once the reader adjusts to the pace and syntax of the script format \u2014 a comforting feeling descends, for the world seems just as it was left when the last pages of Book 7 were reluctantly closed.Rowling never misses a chance to raise a moral conundrum, and characters are always deeper than two-dimensional, even in script from. Albus Potter, bearing the unwelcome burden of being the son of the most famous wizard to live, is faced with having to navigate Hogwarts with the same lack of anonymity as his father did. The first person young Albus encounters on the train is Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry\u2019s nemesis, Draco Malfoy. Young Rose Weasley, daughter of Hermione and Ron, heads off to make other friends, but Albus stays, and in typical Rowling fashion, he befriends the last person that his father would expect him to. These sorts of moral twists are some of the reasons Rowling\u2019s books resonate so deeply, as they appeal to our better natures.  HARRY [quoting Dumbledore]: \u201cThe truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.\u201dThe twists and turns continue, and preconceptions and expectations are turned on their heads, as though Rowling is reminding the reader that change is good and an open mind should always be the goal. Not only are the characters\u2019 prejudices challenged, but so, too, are those of the reader, and once again Rowling takes a fantasy and elevates it with characters that are distinct, flawed and endearing. There will be plenty who denounce Rowling for reopening Harry Potter\u2019s world, but for those for whom the loves run deep, treasures await.If it all sounds confusing, it is, as there were several hands involved in the creation of the first of two installments that are set 19 years after Harry Potter left Hogwarts and defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort. Rowling hinted at this glimpse of Harry\u2019s future in the epilogue of \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d and some of that much-analyzed final chapter is overlapped nearly verbatim in the play\u2019s script; indeed, it serves as a jumping-off point for a new and wondrous adventure for Harry, his cohorts and the next generation of wizarding offspring. For true Potter fans, this might be enough to be pulled back into the story. That said, the very nature of the play format of \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d allows for very little detail, which is where Rowling\u2019s real storytelling gifts reside. Her ability to build fully developed characters is unsurpassed and is what comprises the center of the allure of the Harry Potter series.  DRACO: Hermione Granger, I\u2019m being bossed around by Hermione Granger. And I\u2019m mildly enjoying it.Lastly, Draco and Hermione have been shipped together since the books first came out, and there is a moment dedicated to them. I've never understood the obsessiveness of their relationship, and it disgusts me; it's like shipping a white man who is a racist with black woman. It doesn't make sense. He might have changed his attitude towards muggle born people, his prejudice will never completely disappear. This line, I must admit, made me smile a bit as I realized it will make the majority of Draco and Hermione shippers happy. Yes, I felt happy for them, as pathetic as it makes me sound.The story, once you get past the awkward format, is gripping. I devoured it in one afternoon. There are quite a few surprises in store for hardcore fans. On the whole, the tone is very appropriate for those who have \"grown up\" along with Harry. Fans who are now adults can relate with the themes explored here, even when characters mess up pretty badly. Harry certainly made plenty of his own mistakes over the years, and occasionally acted like a jerk. I'd argue that it's worth giving Harry's progeny a chance, even if you don't take to him at first. At the very least, read it for Scorpius. I'm not saying you definitely won't be disappointed, but there are far worse ways for a Potter fan to bide the time until Fantastic Beasts gives us a weightier addition to the Potter universe.  DRACO: Keep up, old man.HARRY: We\u2019re the same age, Draco.DRACO: I wear it better."},

Not to mention the eventual movie release of Cursed Child. We all know it's going to happen, not that I'm complaining. But still, saying goodbye to Harry, if only for a while, is always hard. On a positive note though, I'm pleased to say Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was not a disappointment. What a relief!Just holding this book in my hand was like riding the Hogwarts Express back to my childhood, a time when I eagerly waited in line to buy the next book in the series. Sure, the cover for Cursed Child isn't quite the same as the original books, but it had the same feeling in my hands which was a nice dose of nostalgia in itself. Regardless of the fact that this is a script, it still reads very much like the series I know and love. It flows wonderfully and I was able to finish in one day without ever getting bored.Now for all the things I loved about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child:1. First and foremost, THE FREAKING TROLLEY WITCH!!!(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]2. Scorpius Malfoy... I actually liked that kid. Like, more than I liked Albus Potter. Scorpius Malfoy is a sweet character... I know, right?3. Minerva McGonagall. This is no different than always. But seeing her in Headmaster mode is the best, basically.4. Just all the returning characters altogether.5. The budding friendship between Harry and Malfoy.6. Harry Potter as a dad. Is he a good dad? Not usually. Is he a jerk at times? Oh, yeah. Harry has unflinchingly faced terrifying situations in the past, but when it comes to being a parent he is absolutely terrified. It's a flaw he has to learn to get past which adds a new layer onto his character that we've never seen before, for better or for worse.7. And just countless other things!!!I know a lot of people were let down by this script, but I'm giving it my Potterhead stamp of approval.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[ (hide spoiler)]"},

As we all should be aware, even though most don't understand, this is NOT another Harry Potter book. This is a screenplay of the play \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" that is being performed in London. Many people have had issues with being unable to connect with characters, saying that it reads like fanfiction, and that it is a disappointment. This is because it is meant to be seen, not read. It is a visual experience, and this is what makes it different. It is hard to connect with characters and settings if there are no descriptions and further discussions about what is happening. I personally thought that this was an amazing addition to the already phenomenal series, as that is what it is meant to be. This brought back the excitement and joy of receiving and reading a Harry Potter book for the first time, and that in itself was irreplaceable.I loved seeing all of the new characters, as well as reconnecting with the old. This was not an adventure with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, this was about their children. While this book mainly focused on Albus and Scorpius, I loved the additional scenes with the original group. Since I am a diehard Draco Malfoy fan, there is no surprise that I was absolutely enthralled by his son, even though he was COMPLETELY different than his father. Scorpius was such an interesting character, and I do wish that there was another book to develop him further. He did not lack depth, nor was he boring to read about, and it made me extremely happy to see Draco's son as one of the main characters. I loved how logical and decisive he was, and how he was truly awkward and lacked the confidence of his father. He is such a raw character that I would love to learn even more about. Albus was also interesting to read about but sometimes his stupidity would frustrate me to no extent. He was cocky, manipulative, and disrespectful throughout a majority of the play, and was not really fleshed out (which is understandable as it was a PLAY). It almost seems like the writer switched the personalities of Harry and Draco and made them a bit different. Regardless, I do think that he grew as a character and understood the consequences of his actions later on. I loved how the topic of acceptance and the feeling of being disconnected were so deeply discussed. Everyone goes through these struggles and deals with hardships, and they made that very clear. Just because Albus was the son of Harry does not mean that life would be magical and perfect for him forever. Just because Scorpius was the son of Draco does not mean that evil will cross his path and he will be entitled and lack sensitivity. Harry and Draco explicitly discuss their mistakes and their frustrations which made them seem more real and more human than their sons thought they were. Their sons take some of their best qualities and become people of their own, which is very refreshing to read about.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my read of this play and do recommend it to Harry Potter fans. This brought back so much happiness for me, and had great connections to the previous books. I do caution readers who expect a new Harry Potter book to put aside such thoughts and read this for what it is: an amazing addition to the world, but a visual play that is meant to be seen. 4 out of 5 stars!

All of that being said, I still do think that it's a shame what this story has turned into. I could sense from beginning to end that this wasn't written by J. K. Rowling, and it disappointed me a lot to find so many faults with it. The biggest fault, I find, is the fact that the main decision of this play (a decision made by one of the main characters, and a decision which the rest of the play is based on), DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!!! There is no reasoning whatsoever behind this decision, and I did not believe it to be credible. It felt like the decision was made only to move the plot forward which I'm never a big fan of, and obviously that affects the rest of the play and taints the story, and I didn't like it. Another thing that I wasn't absolutely crazy with were the characters who didn't seem well-developed in my eyes. These characters were obviously made for theatre, but once again they didn't seem credible to me, and therefore they were disappointing. Things were turned upside down, and the characters we know and love from the original story behave weirdly. Last but not least, having now finished this play I can't help but wonder: What was the purpose? We got a story that took place nineteen years later and that we could've easily lived without. I didn't feel like anything new was added to this world and these characters, and that must be one of the biggest disappointment of all. So, all in all, while I did love how this must be playing out on stage, I don't think this story is a natural and necessary continuation of the original one."},

I've seen a few people saying that the format bothered them but I really didn't mind at all. The plot, however, was like reading something from a group of drunk people that decided to co-write the most insane HP fanfic the world has ever seen. None of it seemed canon at all. Everything was so crazy and bizarre and so implausible. And the characters! This book took my favorite characters and turned them into people that I couldn't even recognize. The only one that stayed true was Ron (and he was the best part of this entire mess of a play/book). Yes, I know that this takes place 19 years after Deathly Hallows and it's to be expected that the characters would change in 19 years. But this was more than character development. They took away most of the best qualities from the characters and turned them into unlikable strangers. Overall, I'm heartbroken after reading this book. I was so excited about it and it was, to be completely honest, trash. I almost wish that I never read it. I cannot and will not accept any of this as canon.

I've read the spoilers, I've seen the reviews. I've seen so many criticisms of this, of J.K, of the writing the plot the characters. You name it - I've seen hate on it. I think those criticism are founded. CURSED CHILD does not feel like the Harry Potter I grew up with. It doesn't feel like Hogwarts. It's all so wrong. It really does read like a fanfic. The first thing that struck me was like - Wow. Harry Potter and co. are OLD. And I know this might be weird but it immediately disengaged me from them. Immediately I was unable to connect with them as I had before. When I read Harry Potter the first time he was a kid like me - I loved to go on adventures with him, to deal with the trials of school with him. His day to day life was relatable, I mean, I was a kid too. A kid who envied HIS childhood. But I mean ?! 40 year old Harry. I can't roll with that. He's immediately unrelatable to me. Alot of dialogue from Harry / Ron / Hermione was them complaining about the hardships of being old. And it's just ?? It loses the magic. It immediately pulls the magical story of wizard schools and dragons and spells and potions into something so incredibly mundane and Harry Potter should never feel mundane.The next thing that struck me was the characterization. These people are not the Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Draco ect. we grew up with. They're just not. In fact - half the time I was left wondering if Jack Thorne ever read the books - because these portrayals are soo movie. Ron was reduced to a wise-cracking fool who wasn't capable of anything. He felt like a weird stand-in for Fred and George Weasley. He didn't feel like Ron. Hermione was just ? silly ? So many of the things she did were soo out of character. She was stupid, she bent for others, there was a part where she refused to defend Harry and Ron? (I'm sorry but Hermione ALWAYS defends them so smh). I just ? It was all wrong. BUT THE BIGGEST ABOMINATION, the absolute heartbreak of this book resides in the charactersation of my #1 son, Harry James Potter. Now you listen here, Harry Potter is my child. I HAVE CRIED FOR THIS BOY TOO MANY TIMES. Ok ay I don't appreciate when people try to mess with his personality and call it Canon. This was not Harry Potter. His dialogue made no sense - it completely disregarded some of the fundamental aspects of his character. His respect ? gone. His sarcastic humour? gone. His unflinching bravery ? gone. His selflessness ? gone. Harry was SO RUDE, he was so mean !?! And so much of it didn't make sense. (view spoiler)[ He perpetrates rumours Scorp is Voldy's son even though he, as a child, had to also deal with terrible rumours and should sympathise. And WOULD sympathise since he's a sympathetic guy. The fact he hates Al for being a Slytherin. His treatment of McGonagall who's always been a friend/mentor to him and someone he deeply respects. His treatment of Albus with the whole map thing ?? THE FACT IT WAS EVEN SUGGESTED HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT CEDRIC DYING. No no no no no no no no.  (hide spoiler)]the only bit I liked, when I was like ayy it's ma BOY was (view spoiler)[when he wouldn't let anyone volunteer to take on Delphi like ofc he wasn't gonna let you guys this is Harry Potter  (hide spoiler)] ALL IN ALL JACK THORNE GET UR GRUBBY HANDS OFF OF HARRY POTTER HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.   \u201cThey were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what \u2013 those flaws almost made them greater.\u201d  Ok. Plotwise. The plot is kind of fun, if you ignore the huge plot holes and failure to grasp some of the basics of the actual canon. I mean, the time travel aspect was fun, and if you try not to think about it too much and ignore all the crazy conveniences that popped up to move it along it does pass as a plausible plot.But jokes because I DO think about it too much.  (PS. UNTAGGED SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT YOU'VE BEEN WARNED) We'll start with the time turner, shall we? First of all - ok. I could accept it existed, I could allow myself that reach BUT THEN HERMIONE HIDING IT IN A BOOKCASE. wtf nooo. I mean, why tf even hide it with riddles that's ridiculous. Surely she's smarter then this (SHE IS SMARTER THEN THIS)Going back in time to save Cedric ???? Again, surely Albus and Scorp are smarter than this. Clearly thats a terrible idea. Clearly its not going to work. This whole plot point was just such a stretch. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea. It wasn't and any decent, mildly intelligent wizard should know that. (I know that and I'm a goddamn muggle)Okay. The fact that Cedric was so embarrassed it turned him evil ? wtf wtf JUST WHY. The fact he killed Neville and became a Death Eater. Can ! We ! Not ! Disrespect ! His ! Character ! Like ! This ! Oooh boy! And we haven't even got into the big thing yet. Delphi . . . .. . fucking Delphi.. GOD just NO. I mean, first of all practically it doesn't even fit in with the canon timeline (Delphi was born @ Malfoy manor before the battle of hogwarts and yet Hermione/Ron/Harry were there before the battle with Bellatrix aND SHE WASN'T PREGNANT FOR SURE. Also, the insinuation Astoria was involved (possibly raped?) by Voldermort was .. really icky. ? I didn't like that at all. Anyway, all in all that whole thing was a mess. EVEN IF voldermort COULD have kids (which lbr he probs can't) Voldermort was never available to do that, he had no reason. ?!?! URGH JUST PLS STOP it was so bad. Finally, I was really annoyed the villian was Voldermort yet again. I'm sorry but it's soo lazy. Could they have not thought up something new and funky fresh. It would have been refreshing. Voldermort coming back is So Tired and just destoys the entire point of 7 books. Voldermort is dead! Gone ! finished ! We didn't go on that horcrux hunt for nothing !!!!!! just urrrrrrghokay other weird plot points. Albus kissing his aunt ??? g ross. The convenience of Draco HAPPENING to have another (flawless) time turner The weird outbursts from Harry at Minerva?The \"Evil base\" being in a wizards old people's home (what ) TeDDY LUPIN WASN'T IN ITRose ? ? ? ?? Rose and Scorp ??? ( sorry but there's NO chemistry there and Al and Scorp are canon boyfriends) The bit when they watch James/Lily die. The fact Harry is all 'I have to see it' even though he has seen it. Deathly Hallows. In extreme detail. It was just really uncomfortable to me. THE BIT WHEN THE TRAIN LADY ATTACKED THEM WHAT WAS THAT WHAT THE ACTUAL HECKOTHER NOTEI was also disappointed on an authorial level by J.K in this. Honestly, I was expecting more diversity. J.K champions diverse Lit on twitter, but lets be real she had a great oppurtunity to implement that and it fell through. TRUE, you can argue Hermione is black but it's not explicit so it doesn't mean anything. They could have made anyone more diverse. (The queerbaiting on Al and Scorp was REAL) but instead it's all \"white and straight\" and idk I'm just a bit disappointed in her for that. -------------------------------------------Ok. But what did I like ?Okay. It is fun. In a fanfic kind of way it is a fun story. We should never consider this canon, but it is entertaining. I did read it in one day. And I'm damn willing to bet the stage is amazing. The stage directions and settings were really amazing and I think implemented this show would be, aesthetically, really nice. I also appreciated Draco's redemption arc. That was nice, and you know what, deserved. I appreciated Snape's a little less, because I hate snape forever and always but if you're a fan I can see you'd appreciate that too. I appreciated Ginny's take on being possessed and how NO ONE helped her after Chamber of Secrets .. which .. was true. I AM SO SHOOK ABOUT HOW RON SAID EVERYONE THOUGHT SHE'D BE A SLYTHERIN LIEK GODFUCKING DAMN YES YES BEAUTIFUL I also quite liked Draco's little revelations about being jealous of the trio, and of not revealing Harry at Malfoy Manor which - ok yeah was solid work. It was just everything else that was a mess. You cannot take this seriously because it wILL fall flat. But if you are able to detach yourself from the characters and try not to view them as the one's we know and love perhaps you'd really enjoy it. I'm not able to do that, however. Which is why I can't give this any more than a 3*. It deserves a 2, sentimentality makes me bump it up to a 2.5 and that's my FINAL RATING. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child? 2.5*. Sorry, not sorry. NOTE: Sick of people telling me I didn't like this because it's a script. No. No I've read scripts before, I've read scripts and loved them. This isn't bad because it's a script. It's bad because it reduces our characters to uninspired tropes, because it's full of plot holes and because it's lazy.

Second of all, this got tragically long, I'm really sorry, and honestly this is just a mess. but so is this play. u reap what u sow xoxo)Ok so first this is a message to harry james potter fans, and them alone. Please, PLEASE, do not make my mistakes, do not read the cursed child. If you love Harry you know that he is the best person that has ever lived and therefore it is clear for everyone he doesn't deserve any of the shit happening in this book. ANY OF IT. And neither do you! He's beautiful, and you're all beautiful, and I'm beautiful, and none of us deserved this. (but especially harry)Now that that's been said, i need to add: if you think this review focuses solely on harry james potter and ignores everything every other character has been through, well, you'd be right. To be perfectly clear, i give zero fucks about other characters. i don't care about their sad lives, i don't care about their feelings and it's perfectly obvious to me that whatever they go through, none of it comes even close to whatever horror harry's living. so, i don't care about albus severus, i certainly don't care about draco malfoy, and i don't particularly care about talking about harry's flaws either, so be sure that i won't. byeANYWAY, i still don't know where to start. i don't know, as a person who has been resentful of her own parents and who is as a result suspicious of parents in general, i don't particularly appreciate this attempt to make harry james potter, my favourite character ever, someone who i've loved for 16 years and who got me through the worst moments of my life when i thought i had nothing else, someone that i've always looked up to, become everything i hate. So, really, thanks for that ! (That still doesn't stop Harry from being the most beautiful person, but still, disgusting)And aside from this personal disgust about the whole thing, i'm pretty sure there are more original ways to tell a story. because of course everyone struggles with the war, and with everything else they've been through, and the kids have to deal with who their parents are, that makes perfect sense to me, but i don't KNOW why this has to be achieved by making harry look like an asshole. i also don't know why we get this whole HARRY IS A BAD FATHER!!!!11\u00a71u0026amp;!u0026amp;! thing when we don't even get the perspective of his other two children, who don't really seem to have a problem with him. maybe they do, but either way, we don't know. why? WHATEVER THIS STORYLINE WASN'T NECESSARY AND I HATE IT. but if it that wasn't enough (of course it wasn't) we then have to deal with harry behaving in ways he actually would never. my first question is WHY on earth is he head of magical law enforcement when 1) he hates the ministry 2) he has always opposed the ministry's decisions 3) he was himself a victim of the ministry and of this same department 4) he witnessed first hand how crap they are 5) WHY!!! WOULD!!! HE!!! WORK!!! FOR!!! THEM!!! AND WHY WOULD HE BE THE BOSS. I know Harry's wanted to be an auror but HE WAS FOURTEEN and in the middle of a war, and obviously i know he always wants to save the world and get the bad guys so they won't hurt anyone else but i just can't see why after the war he would have wanted this to be his daily life, and especially not by working at the ministry. But whatever i've never agreed with this anyway and i'm always going to be angry about it soooo. ok anyway being head of magical law enforcement then turns him into some asshole that threatens people for no valid reason, a person that is literally the opposite of who harry james potter is, but ok. ok. i also can't figure out a way to believe harry would actually threaten his son to spy on him by putting a spell on him to see and hear everything he sees and hears. what the fuck?????? what the fuck. good for you if you want to write harry like this but IT IS NOT HIM and he would never be this person, he was never like this and he has no reason to become this as an adult. NEVER!!!!!! And, on top of it, after i had to read this nonsense with my own eyes, who shows up to offer harry some well-needed parenting advice? DRACO MALFOY. i mean....... i don't actually have words for this. but thanks for making harry look like a loser while everyone around him is so much more sensible and better. I think that's all for BAD DAD HARRY, SHIT DUDE HARRY (no it's not but i don't want to talk about it anymore), but if only that was the only problem. No, because when they finally decide to write Harry as himself (finally indeed), they go back to what's worked so well in books 1 to 7: MAKING. HARRY. SUFFER. So i'll just make a list if you don't mind of all the SHIT (shit is a truly weak word for what he actually gets here) he has to deal with in this exciting play:- harry standing alone in his office, tired, \"the weight of the world upon his shoulders\" tell me something i don't know??????? this is harry james potter at ages 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. LET HIM LIVE- amos diggory shows up to his doorstep in the middle of the night to blame him for cedric's death- his own son, piece of shit son albus severus, mocks him for the abuse he's been through and acts like harry's ever asked any of this to happen to him, or like the world would be better off if harry hadn't been there to save it (an opinion that quickly gets shot down when scorpius stumbles into voldemort lives au. thanks harry for saving the world indeed and pretty much dying doing it)- albus severus also blames him for everyone that died during the war. why not.- this obviously results in harry feeling guilty and blaming himself for everything which, again, i have already read about in the seven previous books- albus severus who has the audacity to say harry \"doesn't care\", spare me with your teenage emo problems buddy, come to my face and tell me that harry, harry james potter, who constantly feels so much about everyone and everything, DOESN'T CARE. - (side note, i find it funny that everyone calls harry whiny during order of the phoenix and blames him for dealing with everything that happens then, when we have here in albus a perfect example of what a whiny person actually is)- harry's scar hurting again after TWENTY TWO YEARS like either he thought he was free of it and now he's not or either there was always a part of him who never totally believed voldemort was really gone, and now he has to be like \"is he. could he be back.\" fun times once more- flashbacks of the dursleys abusing harry in case, again, we haven't seen enough of that before- harry then gets to yell at dumbledore('s portrait) for 5 short seconds about him sending him back to privet drive every year which is like, ABOUT TIME, but of course this part only exists so that harry can forgive dumbledore who is, i quote, \"weeping openly\" and have harry agree to say that love \"blinds people\" and make them make mistakes and that therefore everything dumbledore did is perfectly justified. which then makes harry compare dumbledore sending him to the dursleys, where he was sure to be hated and treated like shit, to himself sending albus to hogwarts, where he was sure to have friends bc HE ALREADY HAD FRIENDS. well, that's not the same, harry is not dumbledore, and i don't see why they have to make him think that. fuck you- harry then being used to say that dumbledore and snape were great men, i don't care how great they were, they wEReN'T, AND I DON'T WANT HARRY TO SAY THAT. i could write pages about forgiveness and i've never had a problem with harry forgiving them but i think there's a difference between forgiving them because that's who he is, because he always forgives, and actually justifying whatever horrible things they did, and i don't see why he always has to be the one justifying it, because if he forgives and justifies it then it almost makes it look ok. BUT IT'S NOT. FUCK OFF.- \"harry is consumed in his grief\" story of his life- another moment where he blames himself and thinks everyone would be better off if he had died like he was \"supposed to\" listen to me harry james potter i don't want to hear this!!!! you didn't do anything wrong!!!! you saved the world!!!! where would they be without you!- and then of course, the whole time turner business brings him back where? October 31st 1981, Godric's Hollow, night of his parents' deaths. excellent.- but not before having to transfigure himself into voldemort!!!!!!!! like nothing that happened to him has been enough, he has to BE voldemort. why??? W H Y. WHAT JUSTIFIES MAKING HIM GO THROUGH THIS. WHAT.- \"it has to be me\" of course it has harry. OF COURSE.- and then....... finally...... we finally reach what seems to have been the purpose of this whole play..... order has been restored, the world has been saved, they fought evil and won, all of this for what????? yes, to stand there and watch lily and james die. Yay ! - before actually seeing this tho he also has to see voldemort actually ALIVE, which is a great moment for him. i'm pretty sure this figures in his top 5 things he wanted most in his life, 23 years after his death- ginny is like \"you don't have to watch\" thank you ginny, but SADLY \"i'm letting it happen, of course i have to watch\" NO, YOU DON'T, YOU BLOODY FOOL, YOU HAVE DONE NOTHING IN YOUR LIFE THAT JUSTIFIES DOING THIS TO YOURSELF. HARRY, I LOVE YOU, DON'T DO IT--- but no. he does. because having to relive his parents' murder in memories and nightmares or whenever a dementor comes close to him apparently was NOT enough, no, what he clearly was missing from his life was to witness it as a 40 year-old man. cool. just cool. - allow me to quote the exact second where he sees lily die : \"and it's like lightning passes through harry's body, he's sent to the floor, a pure mess of grief\"- ............................- ............................- ............................Why ????????? WHO. Who thought this was great. What was this person's thought process? \"Hey you know what i think? harry hasn't suffered enough in his life, i think what's missing is that he should be there in godric's hollow in 1981, to see his parents die, right? he totally deserves this.\"- i don't know. i don't understand this play. if i wanted to see harry suffer well i already had 7 books of it, 7 books where his life constantly gets worse, and whatever rare moments of joy (i can't even say happiness, when has this kid ever been happy?) he gets are soon replaced by moments of horror. the books end with an epilogue that make it look like harry gets to live and to be happy, but 9 years later, we find out that that's actually not the case? why doesn't his suffering ever end? obviously i know that given what he's been through he's always gonna have nightmares and he's gonna carry his scars with him and he's never gonna forget but does it have to be all he gets?? i know he's always gonna live through some painful moments ok bc he's human and we all have to go through painful moments, and the pain doesn't stop just because he's defeated voldemort and saved the world, but my question is: do we really need to see it??? what does this bring to his story ? is it character development to see him go through the same things over and over again ? is it narratively satisfying?? like, of course he feels guilty, he's always felt guilty, i know he feels guilty, i don't have to be told about how often he goes see cedric's grave to say he's sorry to know just how sorry he feels. did i mention i've loved him for 16 years ? i know very well he blames himself for everything, he feels everything is his fault and he feels personally responsible for every person he couldn't save, and while i very much love him for it, because he cares so much, because of everything he is, i actually don't want to see it. i've already seen it. i know he's sad. but i love him, and i want him to see him happy. i deserve to see him happy, and he deserves to be. contrary to popular belief stories don't have to be awful all the time. that's not what makes a story good or worth telling. at the very least, it is all sorts of terrible and disgusting to use BAD DAD HARRY as a PLOT DEVICE just to make him go through horrible things, again. the reason any of it happens is because of albus and harry's relationship. this story wasn't necessary. there were plenty of stories about harry to tell, that respected him as a person and as a character, that didn't make light of what happened to him but that also allowed him and us to see beyond it. i for one would have very much liked to see harry happy, struggling sometimes and feeling sad occasionally but still being happy, someone who is still very much caring for others, helping other people, and making the world a better place. because that's who harry is, and there were much better stories than him being a shit ass auror, a shit ass dad, because we've always known him as such a good person, and even in this horrible play, that's still what comes through, how much he cares, how much he wants to save everyone, because you can't take that away from him no matter how much you try your hardest to make him look like he's not as great as an adult as he was a kid. Ginny even says at some point that everyone sees him as The Hero, but that they fail to see how he's been heroic in quiet ways, and i think that's true, and i think focusing on that would have been better, not some grand epic hero moment where he defeats evil, because he's already done that, but just moments of his every day life where he saves the world one day at a time, one person at a time, quietly, just by helping people and making the world better. But i suppose doing that would involve being a good writer, and no one involved in this play has proven to be one.Of course, even if you focus on something in this play other than harry, though i don't see why you would, you'll realise that it is still super shit. The storyline itself, if it can even be called that, shows no originality as 1) the books have dealt with time travel before 2) let alone characters who are not who they say they are 3) i've read fics like this a thousand times before as well, as if no one has ever had the idea to make voldemort and bellatrix have a secret baby, and now we're supposed to act like this is just magnificently written and plotted. (The fics were actually better, not sorry to say, bc none of them treated harry like this.) Well, it's not, it's stupid, it is not a good story, and everyone who has the audacity to act like this is incredible and excellent storytelling frankly needs to read better books. And the play doesn't even really have a resolution. Where do Albus and Harry go from here? What do James and Lily think of the whole thing? IS HARRY GONNA BE HAPPY ONE DAY ? Not to mention it is laughable that the whole story is sort of about albus and scorpius' friendship, with some moments between them worthy of the angstiest romance novels i've ever read, only to end with scorpius asking rose out. we get it, everyone is a straight, but that adds nothing to the story and is only just another example of a boy randomly wanting a girl who doesn't want anything to do with him. And they're FOURTEEN. And why did draco randomly replace ron as harry's best friend, ron was just there to make jokes and everything happened without him, and even as someone who has definitely not been his greatest fan, i can tell you he deserved much much better. who would have thought that in the year 2016 ron weasley would be the newest victim of the drarries. everything happens i guess. and why do we have to care about draco's feelings for that matter i wish i knew (PS: special mention to severus snape basically requoting a kingdom or this to albus and scorpius. truly iconic)i don't know what else to say. this was terrible and disappointing in every possible way. The best part was ron and hermione, so i guess there will be at least one group of people satisfied with this. Good for them. But i'm just angry that Harry Potter, as a character and as a series, has meant so much to me for so long, only to end like this, for no valid reason. like deathly hallows actually ended with hope (and im not counting the epilogue), it was about harry finally being free of voldemort and the war and of course horrible things happened because it was a war and people died, and it was going to take them time to deal with this, but harry was seventeen, and he had his whole life before him, and you could feel he was going to be ok (the book literally ends with the words ALL WAS WELL). and now we're here, he's 20 years older, but he's not ok, it almost seems like no time has passed, and it almost seems like he's gonna be stuck like this forever. and even if you wanted to play the bad father harry card, there was no need for this story, like you could just introduce that harry and albus had a bad relationship, whatever, and then they could have spent the whole play fighting to make it better, to talk to each other and to learn and to become better together, but no, instead nonsense happens and we end with one shit conversation about how dumbledore and snape were great men and we're supposed to believe that they're gonna be ok after this. that is of course until jkr decides she isn't done with harry's story at all, and writes another sequel where albus murders harry in 20 more years because it turns out their relationship never became better at all. who knows? i wouldn't put it past her. idk i just really don't know what to say, no one needed this, the last book came out in 2007, which is almost 10 years ago, and we didn't feel such a hole in our lives that a sequel had to be written and especially such a shitty one. I DON'T KNOW. i just don't understand. there are just so many ways to write something good but instead it seems like they just took the easy way and wrote straight up nonsense because they knew the fans would eat it up and buy the fucking books no matter what. well, as a fan: fuck you! and by the way, when you write something for money and not because you actually care about the characters, or that you have a specific story about them you need and want to tell, everybody can see it.(PS: if JKR doesn't want to write the story where Harry dismantles the oppressive system of the wizarding world that has allowed the ministry to be the shit that it's always been, i will, and in the meantime i will let harry take a well deserved break on a beautiful beach with his beautiful boyfriend. xoxo)To finish put an end to this horrific review (i'm so sorry) let me just say that i love my darling Harry, i don't care if he's fictional and i shouldn't love him this much, he's always been the realest and the most important for me, he means the world to me and he has saved my life in more ways than one. Even through this pile of shit he remains everything he's always been, the hero he's always been but also so much more than that; always so brave, always so ready to help people, always ready to do something horrible so that someone else doesn't have to, always blaming himself so people won't blame themselves, always trying to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders so that no one else will have to, always worrying over everyone even when no one really actually worries about him, and pretending he's fine so people won't worry, always kind, always trying to be better no matter what, always struggling with many things but still trying to overcome it, always trying so much, and always seeing the best in people, even when they don't deserve it, constantly hilarious, prince of freedom, and always and still such a good and beautiful person. So, Harry, my love, happy birthday, you are the light of the world, i love you all the time and always, and thank you for everything."},

Clearly I felt it had some! The development of one character from the old Harry Potter world in particular was incredible and was easily my favorite part of the whole play. But piss-poor development of the other characters in this story was what caused frustration for me. The person in this play was not the Harry James Potter I adore. And that's just something I couldn't get over. Also, Snape is not nor will he ever be a hero. He is an abuser. Naming his son Albus Severus was something Harry did that I have never gotten over. And I will tell you this play did NOT make me feel better about how we are supposed to view Snape. A man who abuses children for no reason is not a hero. And he does what he does out of obsession, not love. He has no noble cause, and he is not a good man. And the way this play discussed abuse and how Harry should respond to that abuse was super not great.That's all I will add in this review for now. Honestly it was overall a fairly disappointing play, and much like everything else we have learned about the wizarding world outside of the original seven books, I do not accept this story as canon. Much more to come in a video review later. "},

I went to the midnight release, had some butter beer, sang happy birthday to Harry, and counted down to midnight then proceeded to sit there and completely DEVOUR the book. I sat there and just READ IT. I couldn't put it down. I FLEW through it in a couple hours and it was the most epic few hours ever.   \"Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\"     FEELS    First  Go into this with an open mind to fully enjoy it. It takes a little getting used to with the formatting and how it sometimes in the beginning jumped scene to scene. It's a PLAY. Although I read it like a normal book. I didn't picture a stage or anything like that. I was at Hogwarts and all the amazing places this story took us. And I was there with friends who've I've been waiting to fully meet for years like Scorpius and Albus..then I was there with people who have been in my life for years that I grew up with like Harry, Ron and Hermione. Jumping back into this world was such a joy and was like being wrapped up in a warm fuzzy blanket you loved all your life.   \"Those that we love never truly leave us, Harry. There are things that death cannot touch. Paint..and memory..and love.\"    Another thing:  Remember. The characterization might seem a little strange at first but we left our favorites when they were 17 years old. They are ADULTS NOW. And we have some missing years which is up to us to fill in, in our own heads. Honestly it didn't bother me at all because they're still THEM. Harry is still heroic, Ron is still funny, and Hermione is still super smart. They're the same, just OLDER.   \"They were great men with huge flaws, and you know what- those flaws always made them greater.\"    One last tip:  I read this like fanfiction. At times it seriously felt like the best fanfiction I've ever read..and I've read a lot of Harry Potter fanfiction! Or read it like a script. And just ENJOY IT!!! Enjoy being back in the most magical places in the world. Enjoy being with your old friends and catching up with their lives. Because  it's truly something magical and special being back in this world.    \"People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are- and have always been- heroic in the really quiet ways.\"   It's the story we've all be waiting for and its EVERYTHING. This picks up directly after the epilogue of Deathly Hallows. With Albus going off to Hogwarts and its his journey through mostly the 4th year of Hogwarts for him. And all the adventure it comes with. There's a lot of character development too and family bonding and friendship. Albus befriends Scorpius Malfoy. And Albus goes through a tough time being known as \"Harry Potters son.\" They have a pretty rocky relationship and it brings a huge turning point. There are SO many plot twists and a lot of old friends we get to see again. This book drags you through ALL OF THE EMOTIONS AND FEELS. I was a sobbing mess reading a lot of this!!! So read with tissues!!   \"Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We've been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we've blighted their present.\"   If you love Harry Potter, you need to read this. Especially if you loved Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire!! I don't want to give up too much of the plot because I knew absolutely nothing going into it and I loved it. I really hope the play eventually comes to America and I'm always hoping we get more BOOKS!! Because I am never ready to leave Hogwarts fully!! Always remember though..   \"Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.\"   *weeps into eternity*"},

This was without a doubt my most anticipated read of 2016. There has been a void in my life with the absence of new Harry Potter books. So perhaps I built up my expectations of the book too much? That is very much my own fault. I did not finish reading filled with a bitter feeling of disappointment, nor did I finish reading filled with a radiant feeling of immense satisfaction. In fact, I finished reading feeling somewhat indifferent. Have I outgrown this series? HECK NO. But I was never even remotely impressed with the Nineteen Years Later chapter - I found it corny, I like to pretend it doesn't exist. I had hoped that this book would redeem that chapter, and in that aspect, The Cursed Child was most definitely successful.If you have not yet read the book and you intend to do so, PLEASE do not read the rest of this review! I do not want to spoil anything for you! ************************************** The Cursed Child is a screenplay, it is a script, not a novel. The stage directions, accompanied with my imagination, made reading this quite easy. I had no difficulty getting into the story. The story itself follows Albus Severus through his first few years at Hogwarts at a fast-pace. Albus does not feel he fits in with his family, his relationship with his father in particular is tumultuous. Albus\u2019 best friend is Scorpius, the child of Draco Malfoy. At Hogwarts, the two are bullied and teased relentlessly. For Albus and Scorpius, Hogwarts is not home. When Amos Diggory shows up at the Potter house, Albus overhears a conversation between Amos and Harry, where Amos appeals to Harry to use a Time Turner salvaged from the Department of Mysteries to go back in time to save Cedric Diggory. Harry denies. Albus overhears and decides to take matters into his own hands, and is aided by Delphi Diggory, Amos\u2019 niece. I do not like time travel. I\u2019m not sure if I think it\u2019s stupid, or I\u2019m just too stupid to be able to wrap my head around the logistics. I think it has more to do with the notion of revisiting the past more than once. I find that whole concept tired and repetitive and I just do not like it. I was ok with the Time Turner use in Prisoner of Azkaban, and I think that was because they just went back once. It didn\u2019t feel tedious. However, I think bringing back a storyline motivated by Time Turner use, is a regurgitation, I felt like it was a cop out. Don't get me wrong, I liked how it took us back to be able to see the Triwizard Tournament, and even Godric's Hollow, and Hagrid (OH HAGRID), and these sort of alternate-universes. But it also felt a little too much like Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality, which is fan fiction. I have nothing against fan fiction, but I was looking forward to original Harry Potter. I\u2019m aware a lot changes in 19 years (it\u2019s actually closer to 22 years because of how fast-paced the timeline is), regardless, this story did not feel completely like Harry Potter. To an extent, this is perfectly ok, because this is about the younger generation living in a post-Voldemort era. However, I did not particularly enjoy the focus on the younger generation. Albus is Harry and Ginny\u2019s son so I obviously care about him, but the scenes with snippets of older-Harry and the palpable guilt that haunts him, were my favourite parts of the story.My problem with the Deathly Hallows\u2019 Nineteen Years Later chapter was that everything was wrapped up so conveniently, as though everything was suddenly hunky-dory in the wizarding world now that old Voldy had been off\u2019ed. Although The Cursed Child didn\u2019t address the bigger world issues of classism (/blood-status-ism/house-ism ??) and speciesism, I wholeheartedly appreciate the way it approached Harry\u2019s guilt.  HARRY: I shouldn\u2019t have survived \u2014 it was my destiny to die \u2014 even Dumbledore thought so \u2014 and yet I lived. I beat Voldemort. All these people \u2014 all these people \u2014 my parents, Fred, the Fallen Fifty \u2014 and it\u2019s me that gets to live? How is that? All this damage \u2014 and it\u2019s my fault. I liked that we were able to see Harry\u2019s struggle with being a father, largely due to his limited familial relationships. We bear witness to the aftermath of his relationship with Dumbledore, and the impact that had upon him. The scene with Harry revisiting his past with Dumbledore\u2019s portrait brought tears to my eyes. \u201cDUMBLEDORE: No. I was protecting you. I did not want to hurt you . . .DUMBLEDORE attempts to reach out of the portrait \u2014 but he can\u2019t. He begins to cry but tries to hide it.But I had to meet you in the end . . . eleven years old, and you were so brave. So good. You walked uncomplainingly along the path that had been laid at your feet. Of course I loved you . . . and I knew that it would happen all over again . . . that where I loved, I would cause irreparable damage. I am no fit person to love . . . I have never loved without causing harm.\u201dDespite how immensely satisfying this was, I wanted more. I wanted to see:- If Arthur was any closer to understanding batteries, - How Molly was as an overbearing, well-meaning grandmother,- Bill and Fleur handling full-moons,- Percy working under Hermione at the Ministry (??),- GEORGE, my baby George, unable to cope with the loss of his brother; distanced from the smiling, laughing, prankster we love,- Hagrid and Grawp and Olympe working as giant-activists, not for the purpose of trying to gain allies, but to help better their ways of life,- Luna being Luna proving the existence of Crumple-Horned Snorkack's and starting a conservatory for them in Sweden,- Neville with his grandmother who has grown so so so proud of her only grandson, and Neville with his parents, Neville teaching his students about Mimbulus Mimbletonia smiling to himself as he remembers dousing everyone in Stinksap in their Hogwarts Express compartment,- Parvati Patil who still meets with Sybil Trelawney for tea every few months and afterwards they both cry as they remember their best friend and favourite student who they were unable to save during the Battle of Hogwarts, - Teddy Lupin growing up without his parents, but with a loving grandmother and loving godparents and cousin, who feels like he has no right to be sad, but he thinks about the persecution his father faced for being a werewolf, and the persecution his mother faced for simply falling in love and he can\u2019t help but feel sad, and all the werewolves are underground and they don\u2019t lead normal lives, and that could have been him but he was lucky but he doesn\u2019t feel lucky \u2026 - Kreacher who still works in the Hogwarts kitchens who sometimes cleans the Slytherin dorms (even though House Elves are no longer supposed to clean up after humans, the humans are supposed to clean up after themselves) and sometimes sees Albus and Scorpius who have fallen asleep over stacks of Potions homework in the common room so he props pillows under their heads as Regulus\u2019 locket slips out from the top of his tea cozy and lightly grazes Scorpius\u2019 head. - Sirius Black\u2019s name cleared, reform in the Ministry legislature that works to prevent unjust incarceration, a bill passed in his name to appeal sentences and provides fair trials for people accused of committing crimes, the House of Black used as a group home, it's a sanctuary, it's a place of safety, for children/youth who have no families, it's more than an orphanage, it's a place of opportunity. I think you get the point. I wanted more. I do understand that since this is a play, having such a large cast to incorporate these characters and their lives post-Voldemort, would be especially challenging. I really don't care about the execution challenges, it doesn\u2019t stop me from wishing. Very briefly I want to talk about Albus. I\u2019m disappointed in his character; the pressure he feels associated with his family name is completely understandable. What I don\u2019t understand and what I simply CANNOT believe is that his family, siblings, cousins - the Potters' entire NETWORK of people wouldn\u2019t do everything possible to protect Albus. This is a different generation, yes, but Albus' siblings and cousins have parental figures in Ron, Hermione, Harry, and Ginny. You cannot possibly expect me to believe that Albus would not have cousins or siblings who would defend his ass from the petty likes of Polly Chapman? You can\u2019t possibly expect me to believe that JAMES SIRIUS POTTER would stand by as his BROTHER was relentlessly bullied, and CALLED A SQUIB? I don\u2019t buy it. You can't possibly expect me to believe that ROSE GRANGER-WEASLEY would be a bratty, narcisstic schoolgirl who wouldn't defend her cousin? Perhaps this is my fault for having such unwavering faith in the trio. I can't believe for one second that they wouldn't have raised their children to always look out for one another. This could be me holding them to too high of a standard, I understand parenting is hard work. But then again, you can\u2019t possibly expect me to believe that PROFESSOR LONGBOTTOM would even tolerate such behaviour. NEVILLE, who was relentlessly bullied by both his peers and staff would NEVER allow his own students to torment one another. Even Headmistress McGonagall? Bullying tolerated under her authority? You can't even try convincing me that the bullying of Albus (and Scorpius) wouldn't even be on her radar, she has more important things to worry about as Headmistress? Nope. No there is NO fucking way. Not McGonagall. Please don\u2019t get me started on the absurdity that is Bellatrix Lestrange hooking up with Voldemort. (Caidyn's Review goes into fantastic detail about why this seems implausible). But I just can\u2019t even go into detail with that nonsense, it'll get me too wound up I will probably end up stabbing myself with shards of my tangible disappointment. "},

Is it fair to compare the feel of how a car drives to a van? Or a yak to an aardvark? I mean, apples and oranges, right? You might like both, or dislike both, but, they\u2019re different. With that in mind, I\u2019m not entirely sure how to rate The Cursed Child. Lines of dialogue that fell flat on the page might have popped on stage when delivered by a charismatic performer. Scenery and special effects might have added color and tension to a confrontation that seemed a bit tame. Two actors emoting for all their hearts are worth might imbue simple lines with the emotion that transcends what\u2019s written on the page. In other words, as a performance vehicle, The Cursed Child might be stellar. As a pure reading experience, it\u2019s\u2026well, it\u2019s no apple. Or novel, for that matter.So, I\u2019m left to evaluate it solely for the content of its story, rather than quality of its language or descriptions, realizing that the story was very deliberately framed for staging. And, as a story in the HP canon\u2026well, it\u2019s no apple. There\u2019s some delight to be derived from checking in with old, dear friends some years after we last saw them, especially since they\u2019re fictional characters, which means they\u2019re not stricken with the issues that plague, say, a reunion show for a beloved sitcom, where the ravages of time and the fickle finger of (mis)fortune is apparent on the faces (and bodies) of at least some of the stars, unless they are John Stamos, in which case they appear as they always have, with the possible exception that, if possible, their hair looks even better (if I had Stamos\u2019s hair, I\u2019m convinced that I could be elected Supreme Emperor of Earth; it\u2019s that good). Ron Weasley in particular seems to be in this frame of mind, dropping in for some one-dimensional one-liner comic relief here and there, the beloved yet befuddled uncle who\u2019s never quite sure what\u2019s going on around him. The overall tenor and tone, however, is far more serious, and I\u2019m grappling with mixed emotions on that front. On the one hand, one thing I (and millions of other people) loved so much about the HP books is that they made for the perfect escape from the mundane\u2014even when they got dark, you were magically transported to another world, one where magic ruled, where Quidditch was a thing, and where butterbeer could be consumed in mass quantities. On the other\u2026I didn\u2019t grow up with Harry and friends\u2014I was 22 when I discovered the series (which was right around when Goblet of Fire came out, I think), and I was well into my dotage (read: my later twenties) when subsequent volumes arrived, so I didn\u2019t experience the trials and tribulations of adolescence alongside the characters (I did that in the sanctity of my room all by myself, albeit with the help of Tecmo Bowl, the X-Men, and pictures of Kathy Ireland). Still, I was close enough to the age group that did go through that experience to see how easy it would have been to feel like Harry, Hermione, and Ron were akin to real, live, in-the-flesh friends. And, for those people\u2014many of whom are now, themselves, raising children, albeit perhaps slightly younger than Albus and Scorpius\u2014I would imagine there are powerful emotions involved in seeing those friends confronting the same challenges that being a parent entails. And there\u2019s something in seeing fictional characters to whom you\u2019re so attached that, in an odd way, validates and informs your own life experience as much as seeing a close friend go through it might (or even, perhaps, experiencing it yourself).This is a phenomenon unique to addicted readers with avid imaginations, but the power of JK Rowling\u2019s drug is such that she created a generation of junkies who will, I suspect, either fiercely embrace or strongly reject the experience of seeing Harry Potter, boy wizard, the one who defeated He Who Must Not Be Named, struggling to connect with his son in the most mundane ways.Parents were, as often as not, defined as much by their absence as their presence in the HP books (notwithstanding the Weasleys, who, as with Ron in The Cursed Child, resembled nothing so much as the sprawling family from an 80s sitcom family\u2014think the Cosbys or the Seavers with wands), and to have Harry, as a parent, be so simultaneously present and absent is a conundrum. It makes sense, of course, that the boy who grew up without parents, whose father figure was simultaneously his hero and a man he could never fully trust, would struggle as a father himself; but seeing that play out on the page is heartbreaking. Fiction can, and often does, reflect the most real and painful parts of life back at us, and when we seek it out for that purpose, it can be a fulfilling and validating experience in a way few others can. When we seek escapism and magic and adventure, however, and are faced with the overwhelming reality of emotional turmoil\u2026well, it\u2019s disconcerting.Putting aside the staging aspects and judging this solely on the merits of the words printed on the page, as a rip-roaring HP yarn, this is somewhere in 2.5-star territory. As an exploration of how difficult it is to raise a child, no matter how good you might be at the rest of the game of life, and how emotionally eviscerating failing to connect with a tiny human that you made can be, we\u2019ll put in 3.5-star territory.I will, undoubtedly, reread the 7 core HP novels many times in my life (as I already have). Will I reread The Cursed Child? Probably not.Unless, that is, I\u2019m reading it with my kids, in order to stay connected with them and attuned to what they\u2019re feeling and experiencing as they grow and change\u2014something Harry would, by play\u2019s end, appreciate, I think."},

To me, Harry's story ended within the last page of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.   The rest of the review contains spoilers for the original series and mild spoilers for Harry Potter and the Cursed ChildNow, let's analyse the play together, since I am still pretty confused by a lot of things.\u2022 Harry's children. And no, I'm not talking about Albus, who will get a paragraph of his own, but about James and Lily. Sorry, what did you say? You found two personalities lying on the floor? Well, they must be theirs then, since they had none. What is even the purpose of James, besides annoying Albus all the time and being a clone of young James Potter Senior? \u2022 Albus Severus Potter. I just, I DON'T KNOW. Did I like him? I think I mostly liked the concept of him, the idea that he had been (view spoiler)[sorted into Slytherin (hide spoiler)] and that he was so much different from both his siblings and his parents. To Albus, Hogwarts wasn't the amazing place of friendship and adventure that it had been to his father. It was just school. There was homework to do, and there were bullies, and gossip, and rumors. And, constantly behind him, his father's shadow. I mean, I still think Albus seriously needs to get over himself, because he has the worst case of daddy issues I've ever witnessed, but that's somehow understandable. And he was still the only likable Potter in the whole play...\u2022 Harry. I mean, what? Seriously. WHAT? Disclaimer: adult Harry Potter is an asshole. I wasn't n. 1 Harry Stan in the original series either, but here he's just... oblivious, insensitive, horribly self-centered. Childish. Albus is a teenager, a child, but Harry seems to completely fail to understand this. He's overbearing, doesn't get his son at all, and just wants him to be a copy of himself, or - even worse - to \"be more like James and Lily.\" He doesn't see him. And the end of the play doesn't change my opinion on this matter: Harry does not know his son. \u2022 Scorpius My Actual Son Malfoy. I'm sure we can all agree that he needs to be protected at all costs. All right, he's the least Malfoy person on earth, but he's still pretty adorable and dorky. I mean, who would've expected Draco's son to be a cute nerd? Well, not me, that's for sure. Still, even though I really liked Scorpius, his characterization is not canon for me. That's not my Scorpius Malfoy. I've always had a fascination with the more grey characters in the Harry Potter series, like Draco, and I like to think that Scorpius has some of that darkness in him, some of that selfishness, and ambition, but also the same fierce loyalty that Draco showed to his family during the war. To me, \"Malfoy\" and \"cute\" don't belong in the same sentence but, after all, Scorpius is still the reason why this play got an extra star. \u2022 Ron and Hermione. Again, what the hell? I know that, even in the original series, Ron represents the comic relief. However, that doesn't necessarily make him an utter moron. He was absolutely incompetent, and his complete inability to do anything at all besides making inappropriate jokes seemed to also have the purpose to make Hermione look more wonderful in comparison. However, this Hermione was... not Hermione at all. I only saw a glimpse of her in her interactions with Harry, but for the rest of the time, she was just a character with her name and a completely different personality. \u2022 Draco. MY BEAUTIFUL DRACO. Yes, I am one of those people, and I absolutely adore Draco Malfoy. Here we saw a softer version of him, a different version, but honestly - who cares. I just needed to see more of him. *blows kisses* *swoons*\u2022 I don't want to talk about the plot. It's fucking embarrassing how bad it is. Sometimes I even found the plot in the original series too convoluted and unrealistic, but this time it was just plainly nonsensical. Albus' reasons for doing things made no sense to me. (view spoiler)[And really, Voldemort has an evil daughter? What is even the point of that? And why does being Voldemort's child necessarily make her evil? She didn't grow up with her parents.

I'm a bit torn on how to rate this because of the nature of the format, so I'm going to go with a middle of the road 3 stars.

Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\u201dOn July 31, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, a new play based on a story by Rowling, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany premiered at the Palace Theatre in London\u2019s West End. The play, along with a book publication of its script, is the first significant addition to the Potter universe since the credits rolled on the second Deathly Hallows movie in 2011. Harry Potter stands peerless in the realm of literary hits, so Cursed Child was an assured commercial success even before it debuted. Written as a transcript, Cursed Child follows the next generation of wizards and witches.I found the latest installment of the Harry Potter series to be an enjoyable read in the sense that it allowed me to revisit old friends made many years ago (even if only for an afternoon). Harry Potter and the Cursed Child reignited that childlike imaginative spark in me, which is the reason I fell in love with the world of Hogwarts in the first place. Without going into too much detail, the play focuses on the difficulty Harry and Ginny's son, Albus Severus, has with being the underperforming child of the \"the boy who lived\". Albus struggles with living up to the reputation of the Potter name, and subsequently becomes a bit of a loner who does not hold the same esteem for Hogwarts as his parents would have hoped. The piece also speaks to the difficulty Harry has parenting a somewhat rebellious Albus, who is often viewed by others to be \"different\". When Albus befriends the child of a certain former Slytherin house member with whom Harry shared several altercations with during his time at Hogwarts, Harry is tasked with determining whether he should intervene to keep Albus out of trouble, or rather to put his preconceived notions of Malfoy's only son aside and allow Albus to continue to spend time with his one true friend. In addition, Harry must also make Albus understand the difference between seeking out trouble versus confronting it when it presents itself to you \u2013a lesson Albus eventually learns throughout the course of the play.  SCORPIUS: No, it\u2019s time that time-turning became a thing of the past.ALBUS: You\u2019re quite proud of that phrase, aren\u2019t you?SCORPIUS: Been working on it all day.While many readers have voiced their concerns over the writing style and how it pales in comparison to the original series, I would offer the following point. This work is written in such a style to facilitate live performances. As such, it seems unfair to compare the extent to which characters are developed and the overall plot complexity to J.K. Rowling's original series. The original seven were not bound by the added task of producing a narrative which can easily be digested in a spoken format (in addition to proving itself worthy of the original series as a standalone literary text). As I have always preferred dialogue over description, this writing form has been proven itself worthy due to its easy and fast nature to read. I truly don\u2019t understand what's become of J.K. Rowling in recent years. She transformed the literary and cinematic realms with her Potter books, pioneering fantasy trends that continue to this day. I suppose she's trying to make stage plays more popular now? Not sure if that will take off, and it's kind of unfair for the many fans who can't afford to go see the play themselves. Those people are stuck with reading the script, which requires a lot more imagination to really enjoy. There's very little of Rowling's great descriptive prose on display, mostly just dialogue - and it's unclear how much of that was actually written word-for-word by her personally. It sounds like her style; I'll say that. But reading it definitely pales in comparison to reading an actual book. Frankly, I'm disappointed that Rowling hasn't taken the time to flesh this out into a novel. The same goes for the other Potter-related fiction she's written lately - the pre-Fantastic-Beasts pieces on Pottermore, to be precise. It's like reading pitches she hasn't bothered to turn into real books. Obviously, when you're as famous as Rowling, you can get away with posting your world-building notes online or having somebody else turn a story idea into a script and still have millions reading the stuff... but it smacks of laziness on her part, in my opinion.  DUMBLEDORE: Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic.If you came to this book hoping for a new era of Harry Potter, you're going to be disappointed. This book is an epilogue to the original series, not the start of a new one. There's nothing ground-breaking. The mythology is not expanded, and the new characters spend most of their time dealing with the legacies of the original cast. I'm gratified that the wizarding world will be built up by the Fantastic Beasts film(s), but there's a lot of untapped potential in the modern Potterverse that isn't even touched in \"Cursed Child\". There wasn\u2019t enough of Hogwarts, unfortunately, and only focused on the magic outside the castle. I would have liked to see more of the home Harry Potter grew up in. What makes \"Cursed Child\" work despite all the strikes against it is what it does with the aftermath of the original stories. If \"Deathly Hallows\" had to have a follow-up in the first place, then this is a surprisingly good one. It's certainly an improvement on the frequently-criticized, rushed epilogue to \"Hallows\". This is basically an expansion of that last chapter, exploring what it's like for Albus Potter to grow up dealing with his famous dad's legacy, and it's very believable in that respect. True, Albus doesn't come across as likable until near the end of the book, and even Harry shows some striking flaws as a father, but given where both these characters are coming from, these problems make sense. It's not the forced \"happily ever after\" of the Hallows epilogue; it's complex and realistic. Additionally, there's a very sympathetic, funny character in play in the form of Scorpius Malfoy, Draco's son. He ends up stealing the show, and is arguably the hero of the story in his own right. His lines made me laugh out loud more than once, and convinced me that to whatever degree Rowling was involved in writing this story, she's clearly still \"got it\".  ALBUS: \"So what would you like me to do? Magic myself popular? Conjure myself into a new house? Transfigure myself into a better student? Just cast a spell, Dad, and change me into what you want me to be, okay? It'll work better for both of us.\"Scorpius was great addition into the story. His friendship/relationship with Albus was pure, and I appreciate the attention provided towards the importance of friendship. I definitely understand why people would like to see them together as the dialogue and quick descriptions indicate a relationship, which ultimately seems to be more than friendship. Draco and Harry talking, and viewing each other as friends made me feel emotional; it took them more than twenty years, but it was worth it. I still don\u2019t understand the story surrounding Draco and his wife, Astoria. It doesn\u2019t make sense, and seems like bullshit the writers created to expand the plot/story. Parts of the story itself felt a little overdone and rushed, but you must keep in mind that this addition is originally intended to be watched, not read, with delivery fitting under a specific window of time. For this, I know I did not experience the full breath and absorption of Cursed Child during my read-through, and I am sure live-performance characteristics such as dialectic nuances and set transformations would definitely expand this work even more, but just reading the play itself took me back into this world of magic, mishap, and mischievousness that Potterheads are long-time familiar with. I am curious how the experience of watching it live differs, and cannot wait to see it when I have the chance.  DUMBLEDORE: \"Harry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\"The Trolley Witch part made me feel uneasy. It was irrelevant towards the plot, and made me cringe while reading it. I\u2019ve come to a conclusion, in which I cannot consider these events cannon. As much as I enjoy certain twists and additions into the story, much of it doesn\u2019t fit with the original Harry Potter books or does not seem to work. It felt as if the plot read like fan fiction, with its revisiting of the original novels\u2019 plot points, its cameos of beloved characters, and its too-satisfying outcomes; Hermione, for instance, is Minister for Magic and Ginny is the sports editor for the Daily Prophet. Ron seems completely out of character, and revealed he was drunk at his wedding; there was a desperate attempt of humor with his character, which didn\u2019t seem like the original Ron. Voldenmort having a child completely turned me off. He has been hinted to have a relationship with Bellatrix throughout the books, but them having an actual affair and child doesn\u2019t seem to fit. How could Bellatrix be pregnant during the Wizarding War? There was no explanation for this, only the child was born during this time. Of course, their child would want to avenge them, and bring Voldemort back. Another villain would have improved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child as Voldemort\u2019s daughter didn\u2019t do the book any justice. I will not accept that Voldemort had a child with Bellatrix. I can\u2019t, and I won\u2019t.   HARRY: \"I shouldn't have survived \u2014 it was my destiny to die \u2014 even Dumbledore thought so \u2014 and yet I lived. I beat Voldemort. All these people \u2014 all these people \u2014 my parents, Fred, the Fallen Fifty \u2014 and it's me that gets to live? How is that? All this damage \u2014 and it's my fault.\"It's a shame because there's a lot of possibility here. There are interesting storylines taking place here, they just aren't executed on the level we've come to expect from a Rowling product. I enjoy reading time travelling stories, as well as revisiting beloved characters much later in life, but this isn't how these characters act. Albus should never have been this whiny. I liked him in the seventh book. I liked Harry in the original 7. But, here, the characters have become annoying or flat. Additionally, I wasn't a fan of how entwined in the story Harry was. I've already witnessed him and everything he's capable of in the original seven books. Now, he's a blubbering fool. You can't sit there and tell me that Harry Potter, the boy who lived, is going to run to Ginny every time he has a minor problem, and he is not allowed to eat sugar.Having said that, as a reader, you have time to appreciate on the page how nimbly Thorne\u2019s writing navigates the adventure\u2019s death-defying twists and turns, and his stage directions have a poetry of their own, a style that in its lyricism and sense of the abstract is distinct from Rowling\u2019s more direct, story-driven prose.For example, when Albus arrives at Hogwarts and is sorted into his school house, we are told: \u201cThere\u2019s a silence. A perfect, profound silence. One that sits low, twists a bit and has damage within it.\u201d  When the children travel in time, Thorne\u2019s stage direction notes how: \u201ctime stops. And then it turns over, thinks a bit, and begins spooling backwards\u2026\u201d   DRACO: \"... And being alone \u2014 that's so hard. I was alone. And it sent me to a truly dark place. For a long time. Tom Riddle was also a lonely child. You may not understand that, Harry, but I do ...\"As a story containing many possible alternate realities, with a text created to varying degrees by three collaborators, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a complement to Rowling\u2019s original series rather than a straightforward continuation. It won\u2019t satisfy all fans: some have already taken issue with the story\u2019s extensive reliance on time travel, the use of which seems to disagree with the magical precedent set in the books. Others have quibbled with the portrayal of Harry\u2019s character: he comes across as pricklier and even more troubled than he was in Rowling\u2019s books.  And though the release is eagerly anticipated by adult fans who grew up with the books, it remains to be seen whether children will connect with reading a complex story in a less familiar script form.The emotional climax is devastating even on paper. Once again, the fantasy world that Rowling created nearly 20 years ago is at its most powerful when it sets aside magic and reveals the basic, brutal and human mechanics of love and grief. The characters are, mostly, exactly as you remember them, and it\u2019s difficult to overstate how exciting it is to read a new story set in this widely loved fantasy universe. The thrill of a new Harry Potter book, even in script form, is its own kind of magic spell.  HARRY: \"You know what? I'm done being made responsible for your unhappiness. At least you've got a dad. Because I didn't, okay?\"Nonetheless, there is still plenty in this new release to tempt fans, for familiarities abound and the magic is intact, if fleeting. Details are minimal for settings, as can be expected given the format, but it works, as there was an assumption that anyone reading the book knows the world inside and out and can paint the pictures in the mind. In fact, fans will find much that is recognizable in the new story, in spite of the altered vessel of delivery. It is worth noting that there is no effort made by either Rowling or Thorne to acquaint a Harry Potter newcomer to the world, so it is advised for those not familiar with the original series to read the books in sequence. From the opening lines \u2014 once the reader adjusts to the pace and syntax of the script format \u2014 a comforting feeling descends, for the world seems just as it was left when the last pages of Book 7 were reluctantly closed.Rowling never misses a chance to raise a moral conundrum, and characters are always deeper than two-dimensional, even in script from. Albus Potter, bearing the unwelcome burden of being the son of the most famous wizard to live, is faced with having to navigate Hogwarts with the same lack of anonymity as his father did. The first person young Albus encounters on the train is Scorpius Malfoy, the son of Harry\u2019s nemesis, Draco Malfoy. Young Rose Weasley, daughter of Hermione and Ron, heads off to make other friends, but Albus stays, and in typical Rowling fashion, he befriends the last person that his father would expect him to. These sorts of moral twists are some of the reasons Rowling\u2019s books resonate so deeply, as they appeal to our better natures.  HARRY [quoting Dumbledore]: \u201cThe truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.\u201dThe twists and turns continue, and preconceptions and expectations are turned on their heads, as though Rowling is reminding the reader that change is good and an open mind should always be the goal. Not only are the characters\u2019 prejudices challenged, but so, too, are those of the reader, and once again Rowling takes a fantasy and elevates it with characters that are distinct, flawed and endearing. There will be plenty who denounce Rowling for reopening Harry Potter\u2019s world, but for those for whom the loves run deep, treasures await.If it all sounds confusing, it is, as there were several hands involved in the creation of the first of two installments that are set 19 years after Harry Potter left Hogwarts and defeated the Dark Lord Voldemort. Rowling hinted at this glimpse of Harry\u2019s future in the epilogue of \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\u201d and some of that much-analyzed final chapter is overlapped nearly verbatim in the play\u2019s script; indeed, it serves as a jumping-off point for a new and wondrous adventure for Harry, his cohorts and the next generation of wizarding offspring. For true Potter fans, this might be enough to be pulled back into the story. That said, the very nature of the play format of \u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\u201d allows for very little detail, which is where Rowling\u2019s real storytelling gifts reside. Her ability to build fully developed characters is unsurpassed and is what comprises the center of the allure of the Harry Potter series.  DRACO: Hermione Granger, I\u2019m being bossed around by Hermione Granger. And I\u2019m mildly enjoying it.Lastly, Draco and Hermione have been shipped together since the books first came out, and there is a moment dedicated to them. I've never understood the obsessiveness of their relationship, and it disgusts me; it's like shipping a white man who is a racist with black woman. It doesn't make sense. He might have changed his attitude towards muggle born people, his prejudice will never completely disappear. This line, I must admit, made me smile a bit as I realized it will make the majority of Draco and Hermione shippers happy. Yes, I felt happy for them, as pathetic as it makes me sound.The story, once you get past the awkward format, is gripping. I devoured it in one afternoon. There are quite a few surprises in store for hardcore fans. On the whole, the tone is very appropriate for those who have \"grown up\" along with Harry. Fans who are now adults can relate with the themes explored here, even when characters mess up pretty badly. Harry certainly made plenty of his own mistakes over the years, and occasionally acted like a jerk. I'd argue that it's worth giving Harry's progeny a chance, even if you don't take to him at first. At the very least, read it for Scorpius. I'm not saying you definitely won't be disappointed, but there are far worse ways for a Potter fan to bide the time until Fantastic Beasts gives us a weightier addition to the Potter universe.  DRACO: Keep up, old man.HARRY: We\u2019re the same age, Draco.DRACO: I wear it better."},

It's a flippin' script. It reads like a damn script. I don't get the fan-fiction correlation. It was never advertised or was ever going to read anything remotely close to the original story or like a full-fledged novel. Which script has good writing or feels like a fulfilling story? That's what the play is there for. Plus I highly doubt Rowling would allow for it to be absolutely butchered. Whether that's in the sense of the plot or the characters. I don't know what I was expecting going into this. I was terrified though, for sure, because the reviews were quite mixed, bordering more on the negative side. Thus, I expected nothing. Which helped. Massively. It helped me separate the original story from this script and I enjoyed it immensely. I enjoyed it for what it was. It was experimental and the dialogue was a lot of fun, though some parts of the story felt slightly far-fetched. It didn't bother me though. The nostalgia was more than satisfying and more than enough. It was nice to get a brief glimpse again into the lives of those characters who meant so much to us growing up."},

I had stayed away from any news concerning anything to do with the play or this book and so my reading journey remained spoiler-free and my experience unmarred. There were so many additions to this to delight the true Potter fan. Foremost, the inclusion of many characters from the initial cast was something I had not anticipated, and the fact that they played such primary roles, even less so. Many lines from the play were also seized directly from the original series and given new contexts, which had me reading open-mouthed at the brilliance and care taken in writing this.This was such a poignant read as my beloved childhood reads were once again brought back to life and I will never not give anything Harry Potter related five-stars!I feel it is only appropriate to finish this review with one line: After all this time... Always!"},

Not to mention the eventual movie release of Cursed Child. We all know it's going to happen, not that I'm complaining. But still, saying goodbye to Harry, if only for a while, is always hard. On a positive note though, I'm pleased to say Harry Potter and the Cursed Child was not a disappointment. What a relief!Just holding this book in my hand was like riding the Hogwarts Express back to my childhood, a time when I eagerly waited in line to buy the next book in the series. Sure, the cover for Cursed Child isn't quite the same as the original books, but it had the same feeling in my hands which was a nice dose of nostalgia in itself. Regardless of the fact that this is a script, it still reads very much like the series I know and love. It flows wonderfully and I was able to finish in one day without ever getting bored.Now for all the things I loved about Harry Potter and the Cursed Child:1. First and foremost, THE FREAKING TROLLEY WITCH!!!(view spoiler)[ (hide spoiler)]2. Scorpius Malfoy... I actually liked that kid. Like, more than I liked Albus Potter. Scorpius Malfoy is a sweet character... I know, right?3. Minerva McGonagall. This is no different than always. But seeing her in Headmaster mode is the best, basically.4. Just all the returning characters altogether.5. The budding friendship between Harry and Malfoy.6. Harry Potter as a dad. Is he a good dad? Not usually. Is he a jerk at times? Oh, yeah. Harry has unflinchingly faced terrifying situations in the past, but when it comes to being a parent he is absolutely terrified. It's a flaw he has to learn to get past which adds a new layer onto his character that we've never seen before, for better or for worse.7. And just countless other things!!!I know a lot of people were let down by this script, but I'm giving it my Potterhead stamp of approval.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[ (hide spoiler)]"},

As we all should be aware, even though most don't understand, this is NOT another Harry Potter book. This is a screenplay of the play \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" that is being performed in London. Many people have had issues with being unable to connect with characters, saying that it reads like fanfiction, and that it is a disappointment. This is because it is meant to be seen, not read. It is a visual experience, and this is what makes it different. It is hard to connect with characters and settings if there are no descriptions and further discussions about what is happening. I personally thought that this was an amazing addition to the already phenomenal series, as that is what it is meant to be. This brought back the excitement and joy of receiving and reading a Harry Potter book for the first time, and that in itself was irreplaceable.I loved seeing all of the new characters, as well as reconnecting with the old. This was not an adventure with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, this was about their children. While this book mainly focused on Albus and Scorpius, I loved the additional scenes with the original group. Since I am a diehard Draco Malfoy fan, there is no surprise that I was absolutely enthralled by his son, even though he was COMPLETELY different than his father. Scorpius was such an interesting character, and I do wish that there was another book to develop him further. He did not lack depth, nor was he boring to read about, and it made me extremely happy to see Draco's son as one of the main characters. I loved how logical and decisive he was, and how he was truly awkward and lacked the confidence of his father. He is such a raw character that I would love to learn even more about. Albus was also interesting to read about but sometimes his stupidity would frustrate me to no extent. He was cocky, manipulative, and disrespectful throughout a majority of the play, and was not really fleshed out (which is understandable as it was a PLAY). It almost seems like the writer switched the personalities of Harry and Draco and made them a bit different. Regardless, I do think that he grew as a character and understood the consequences of his actions later on. I loved how the topic of acceptance and the feeling of being disconnected were so deeply discussed. Everyone goes through these struggles and deals with hardships, and they made that very clear. Just because Albus was the son of Harry does not mean that life would be magical and perfect for him forever. Just because Scorpius was the son of Draco does not mean that evil will cross his path and he will be entitled and lack sensitivity. Harry and Draco explicitly discuss their mistakes and their frustrations which made them seem more real and more human than their sons thought they were. Their sons take some of their best qualities and become people of their own, which is very refreshing to read about.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed my read of this play and do recommend it to Harry Potter fans. This brought back so much happiness for me, and had great connections to the previous books. I do caution readers who expect a new Harry Potter book to put aside such thoughts and read this for what it is: an amazing addition to the world, but a visual play that is meant to be seen. 4 out of 5 stars!

All of that being said, I still do think that it's a shame what this story has turned into. I could sense from beginning to end that this wasn't written by J. K. Rowling, and it disappointed me a lot to find so many faults with it. The biggest fault, I find, is the fact that the main decision of this play (a decision made by one of the main characters, and a decision which the rest of the play is based on), DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!!! There is no reasoning whatsoever behind this decision, and I did not believe it to be credible. It felt like the decision was made only to move the plot forward which I'm never a big fan of, and obviously that affects the rest of the play and taints the story, and I didn't like it. Another thing that I wasn't absolutely crazy with were the characters who didn't seem well-developed in my eyes. These characters were obviously made for theatre, but once again they didn't seem credible to me, and therefore they were disappointing. Things were turned upside down, and the characters we know and love from the original story behave weirdly. Last but not least, having now finished this play I can't help but wonder: What was the purpose? We got a story that took place nineteen years later and that we could've easily lived without. I didn't feel like anything new was added to this world and these characters, and that must be one of the biggest disappointment of all. So, all in all, while I did love how this must be playing out on stage, I don't think this story is a natural and necessary continuation of the original one."},

The plot, however, was like reading something from a group of drunk people that decided to co-write the most insane HP fanfic the world has ever seen. None of it seemed canon at all. Everything was so crazy and bizarre and so implausible. And the characters! This book took my favorite characters and turned them into people that I couldn't even recognize. The only one that stayed true was Ron (and he was the best part of this entire mess of a play/book). Yes, I know that this takes place 19 years after Deathly Hallows and it's to be expected that the characters would change in 19 years. But this was more than character development. They took away most of the best qualities from the characters and turned them into unlikable strangers. Overall, I'm heartbroken after reading this book. I was so excited about it and it was, to be completely honest, trash. I almost wish that I never read it. I cannot and will not accept any of this as canon.

I've read the spoilers, I've seen the reviews. I've seen so many criticisms of this, of J.K, of the writing the plot the characters. You name it - I've seen hate on it. I think those criticism are founded. CURSED CHILD does not feel like the Harry Potter I grew up with. It doesn't feel like Hogwarts. It's all so wrong. It really does read like a fanfic. The first thing that struck me was like - Wow. Harry Potter and co. are OLD. And I know this might be weird but it immediately disengaged me from them. Immediately I was unable to connect with them as I had before. When I read Harry Potter the first time he was a kid like me - I loved to go on adventures with him, to deal with the trials of school with him. His day to day life was relatable, I mean, I was a kid too. A kid who envied HIS childhood. But I mean ?! 40 year old Harry. I can't roll with that. He's immediately unrelatable to me. Alot of dialogue from Harry / Ron / Hermione was them complaining about the hardships of being old. And it's just ?? It loses the magic. It immediately pulls the magical story of wizard schools and dragons and spells and potions into something so incredibly mundane and Harry Potter should never feel mundane.The next thing that struck me was the characterization. These people are not the Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, Draco ect. we grew up with. They're just not. In fact - half the time I was left wondering if Jack Thorne ever read the books - because these portrayals are soo movie. Ron was reduced to a wise-cracking fool who wasn't capable of anything. He felt like a weird stand-in for Fred and George Weasley. He didn't feel like Ron. Hermione was just ? silly ? So many of the things she did were soo out of character. She was stupid, she bent for others, there was a part where she refused to defend Harry and Ron? (I'm sorry but Hermione ALWAYS defends them so smh). I just ? It was all wrong. BUT THE BIGGEST ABOMINATION, the absolute heartbreak of this book resides in the charactersation of my #1 son, Harry James Potter. Now you listen here, Harry Potter is my child. I HAVE CRIED FOR THIS BOY TOO MANY TIMES. Ok ay I don't appreciate when people try to mess with his personality and call it Canon. This was not Harry Potter. His dialogue made no sense - it completely disregarded some of the fundamental aspects of his character. His respect ? gone. His sarcastic humour? gone. His unflinching bravery ? gone. His selflessness ? gone. Harry was SO RUDE, he was so mean !?! And so much of it didn't make sense. (view spoiler)[ He perpetrates rumours Scorp is Voldy's son even though he, as a child, had to also deal with terrible rumours and should sympathise. And WOULD sympathise since he's a sympathetic guy. The fact he hates Al for being a Slytherin. His treatment of McGonagall who's always been a friend/mentor to him and someone he deeply respects. His treatment of Albus with the whole map thing ?? THE FACT IT WAS EVEN SUGGESTED HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT CEDRIC DYING. No no no no no no no no.  (hide spoiler)]the only bit I liked, when I was like ayy it's ma BOY was (view spoiler)[when he wouldn't let anyone volunteer to take on Delphi like ofc he wasn't gonna let you guys this is Harry Potter  (hide spoiler)] ALL IN ALL JACK THORNE GET UR GRUBBY HANDS OFF OF HARRY POTTER HE DIDN'T DESERVE THAT.   \u201cThey were great men, with huge flaws, and you know what \u2013 those flaws almost made them greater.\u201d  Ok. Plotwise. The plot is kind of fun, if you ignore the huge plot holes and failure to grasp some of the basics of the actual canon. I mean, the time travel aspect was fun, and if you try not to think about it too much and ignore all the crazy conveniences that popped up to move it along it does pass as a plausible plot.But jokes because I DO think about it too much.  (PS. UNTAGGED SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT YOU'VE BEEN WARNED) We'll start with the time turner, shall we? First of all - ok. I could accept it existed, I could allow myself that reach BUT THEN HERMIONE HIDING IT IN A BOOKCASE. wtf nooo. I mean, why tf even hide it with riddles that's ridiculous. Surely she's smarter then this (SHE IS SMARTER THEN THIS)Going back in time to save Cedric ???? Again, surely Albus and Scorp are smarter than this. Clearly thats a terrible idea. Clearly its not going to work. This whole plot point was just such a stretch. I don't know why they thought it was a good idea. It wasn't and any decent, mildly intelligent wizard should know that. (I know that and I'm a goddamn muggle)Okay. The fact that Cedric was so embarrassed it turned him evil ? wtf wtf JUST WHY. The fact he killed Neville and became a Death Eater. Can ! We ! Not ! Disrespect ! His ! Character ! Like ! This ! Oooh boy! And we haven't even got into the big thing yet. Delphi . . . .. . fucking Delphi.. GOD just NO. I mean, first of all practically it doesn't even fit in with the canon timeline (Delphi was born @ Malfoy manor before the battle of hogwarts and yet Hermione/Ron/Harry were there before the battle with Bellatrix aND SHE WASN'T PREGNANT FOR SURE. Also, the insinuation Astoria was involved (possibly raped?) by Voldermort was .. really icky. ? I didn't like that at all. Anyway, all in all that whole thing was a mess. EVEN IF voldermort COULD have kids (which lbr he probs can't) Voldermort was never available to do that, he had no reason. ?!?! URGH JUST PLS STOP it was so bad. Finally, I was really annoyed the villian was Voldermort yet again. I'm sorry but it's soo lazy. Could they have not thought up something new and funky fresh. It would have been refreshing. Voldermort coming back is So Tired and just destoys the entire point of 7 books. Voldermort is dead! Gone ! finished ! We didn't go on that horcrux hunt for nothing !!!!!! just urrrrrrghokay other weird plot points. Albus kissing his aunt ??? g ross. The convenience of Draco HAPPENING to have another (flawless) time turner The weird outbursts from Harry at Minerva?The \"Evil base\" being in a wizards old people's home (what ) TeDDY LUPIN WASN'T IN ITRose ? ? ? ?? Rose and Scorp ??? ( sorry but there's NO chemistry there and Al and Scorp are canon boyfriends) The bit when they watch James/Lily die. The fact Harry is all 'I have to see it' even though he has seen it. Deathly Hallows. In extreme detail. It was just really uncomfortable to me. THE BIT WHEN THE TRAIN LADY ATTACKED THEM WHAT WAS THAT WHAT THE ACTUAL HECKOTHER NOTEI was also disappointed on an authorial level by J.K in this. Honestly, I was expecting more diversity. J.K champions diverse Lit on twitter, but lets be real she had a great oppurtunity to implement that and it fell through. TRUE, you can argue Hermione is black but it's not explicit so it doesn't mean anything. They could have made anyone more diverse. (The queerbaiting on Al and Scorp was REAL) but instead it's all \"white and straight\" and idk I'm just a bit disappointed in her for that. -------------------------------------------Ok. But what did I like ?Okay. It is fun. In a fanfic kind of way it is a fun story. We should never consider this canon, but it is entertaining. I did read it in one day. And I'm damn willing to bet the stage is amazing. The stage directions and settings were really amazing and I think implemented this show would be, aesthetically, really nice. I also appreciated Draco's redemption arc. That was nice, and you know what, deserved. I appreciated Snape's a little less, because I hate snape forever and always but if you're a fan I can see you'd appreciate that too. I appreciated Ginny's take on being possessed and how NO ONE helped her after Chamber of Secrets .. which .. was true. I AM SO SHOOK ABOUT HOW RON SAID EVERYONE THOUGHT SHE'D BE A SLYTHERIN LIEK GODFUCKING DAMN YES YES BEAUTIFUL I also quite liked Draco's little revelations about being jealous of the trio, and of not revealing Harry at Malfoy Manor which - ok yeah was solid work. It was just everything else that was a mess. You cannot take this seriously because it wILL fall flat. But if you are able to detach yourself from the characters and try not to view them as the one's we know and love perhaps you'd really enjoy it. I'm not able to do that, however. Which is why I can't give this any more than a 3*. It deserves a 2, sentimentality makes me bump it up to a 2.5 and that's my FINAL RATING. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child? 2.5*. Sorry, not sorry. NOTE: Sick of people telling me I didn't like this because it's a script. No. No I've read scripts before, I've read scripts and loved them. This isn't bad because it's a script.

There are things that death cannot touch.\"Ahhhh, it felt so good to be back in the world of Witchcraft and Wizardry after all this time.I went into this basically without expectations because I knew this was a script for a play and it was probably going to be totally different from the original Harry Potter books, and it most definitely was. It was a totally different reading experience but I loved it nonetheless! I'm not a big fan of the format but oh well, I'd do anything for a little bit more Harry Potter!Because of the format, this whole thing took some getting used to. You didn't get nearly enough information about the characters, especially the new ones we didn't already know from previous books. Because of that I had some trouble connecting to the characters, I kind of disliked Albus in the beginning, but Scorpius I immediately loved! There were also almost no descriptions of the scenery or the places the characters went to, like Hogwarts, Godric's End, the Ministry and so on. The only thing we read was what happened to the stage during the various scenes/acts. That also took some getting used to but that also meant we had to use our own imagination more, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.Full review coming soon!"},

Really the only reason why it's advertised as the eighth story is to make money. Plus the fact that it's not written by JK is another reason I'm not taking it seriously. Just because she endorsed it doesn't mean I have to. My biggest problem with this book is the awful characterisation. Everyone, I mean EVERYONE was out of character. First Hermione was too unrealistically mean to students just because she didn't marry Ron, which would never happen. Hermione is a kind person regardless of her love life. And in the 'normal' world she just lacked so many things: her passion, her intelligence, her spark. Same with Ron. Ron was only there for comic relief. It was like Movie!Ron but ten times worse. None of his depth, fierce loyalty and intensity was there. And his humour wasn't even his humour. I don't think he said bloody or blimey once. And Harry, oh god. For starters the idea that he would be a bad father or force his son to stop being friends with another student because of his parentage is ludicrous. Also where was that Potter snark I know and love so much. There was just nothing, he was so two-dimensional. Hell even Snape's characterisation was a hot mess. Ginny and Draco weren't too bad, but I feel like that's just because we didn't see them enough in the books for me to be able to judge them properly in The Cursed Child. Then there was the plot which was just as ridiculous. In order to suit the plot, the rules of Time Turners were changed. Now you can go as far back as you want AND you can change what happens to affect the present which is a direct contradiction of what we learnt in the Prisoner of Azkaban. And Delphi, oh my god. What even was that? The mere fact that Voldemort supposedly had a child messed with his characterisation too. He would've never desired any sexual activity with anyone for that to even happen. Delphi herself was a very uninteresting character and she made the script seem very kiddish? Which is yet another thing that bothered me: The writing. The tone was so off for a Harry Potter book. There was no emotion or depth, no darkness even in the parts that were intended to be. I mean Voldemort Day? Really? The script was 90% comic relief with very bad humour. I just can't get over how childish the entire story felt. The fact that everyone was saying exactly what they were thinking was so odd. Like none of the characters are actually like that, but in order to suit the play format everyone was saying exactly how they felt and what they thought and it just didn't translate well at all.I feel like the only good things that came out of this script is Scorpius Malfoy and the cute Romione moments but they're not worth keeping this atrocity on my shelf. I was just massively disappointed with this. Even knowing how much of a trainwreck it was going to be because of spoilers, I still went in hopeful,but it was just not reminiscent of any of the Harry Potters books. Sidenote: Albus Severus Potter kissed Hermione Granger and that was all sorts of fucked up. Now I need to find a way to Obliviate it from my mind. "},

I enjoyed the plot, seeing where all of our favorites ended up and the introduction of new characters. Scorpious was probably the best part of the book. I can't say much without spoilers, but I liked the idea of how the past can affect the present and how little moments can change the course of the future.But overall, I wasn't in love with this book. I'd like to see a production, but I wish it hadn't been published as a play and instead as a story JK Rowling wrote herself. There were several awkward moments written in the play's instructions that I had long pauses at. And mostly I wish Ron hadn't been turned into a bumbling idiot. That and I felt it dragged on a little bit too much. Near the end there was a plot twist that came out of left field and the explanation even more bizarre.Overall like I said I enjoyed it (but I can't talk about what I enjoyed because SPOILERS). But ultimately this book just made me want to reread the originals. "},

There is definitely a different mood and feel to it, but that should have been EXPECTED. It is a different format meant for performance. If you are feeling this way when you are reading it, try to picture the performance in your head, it might help you process what it is supposed to be like. Personally, I loved it. I dove into the 2 plays with such fervor. I dove in headfirst and it met my expectations and more. I must say I loved the character dynamics, comedic attributes and I really respected the way Rowling approached the intertwining of the new generation with the old.Overall I gave these scripts 5/5 stars as it rose above my expectations and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I REALLY WOULD LOVE TO SEE THE TWO PLAYS PERFORMED WITH THE ORIGINAL CAST but sadly that probably won't happen since I live in Canada. The next part of my review will contain SPOILERS so fair warning!!!I would first like to discuss the questions, observations and little disappointments I had while reading. I was disappointed that it no where mentioned or brought up the fact that Neville could have also fulfilled the prophecy. I was questioning why George was never mentioned, especially since Ron is now helping run the joke shop. Where is Teddy Lupin????? I know he wasn't really relevant to the story line but I would have loved to read SOMETHING about how he is doing, it would have been nice. Near the end of the play, Harry faces off against Voldemort's daughter and he... SUCKS. He is terrible.  Yes Harry there was some hardcore judgement there. BECAUSE YOU SUCKED. YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD. We read the 7 books with Harry as our protagonist and as a good wizard. I get that the point the curse child was trying to make was that he was never alone, he always had help. They could have done this without completely trashing Harry's magical abilities. He could have held out longer in the duel or showed some sort of knowledge/experience!!!! He unfortunately was extremely lacking in that department. Which was extremely frustrating to read.There were a lot of plot holes, but we must keep in mind that this is a PLAY and not full fledged novel.My number one praise WAS HOW FUNNY IT WAS!! Of course since it's written as a play, there was more comedic elements and I loved it! Every thing Ron said was hilarious. Also when Albus took the polyjuice potion and was pretending to be Ron. Then Scorpious pointed out he kissed Hermione like 5 times, Albus just stated that Ron was 'an affectionate guy'. I thought that was hilarious.SCORPIUS AND ALBUS THO! I loved their charactersSidenote: I also thought they would be gay and become a couple, I felt that vibe but it never went that way.Scorpius Malfoy was undoubtedly my favorite character in the scripts. In the original 7 novels, I actually really liked Malfoy as a character and was really proud to have the other characters recognize is aptitude and respect him as a person. sidenote #2: I got a picture with Tom Felton (who is one my celebrity crushes) I will put it below BECAUSE LOVE.I also have a picture with the Phelps twins and Rupert Grint but I won't bug you all by putting those here too.I have so many positive things to say, but they aren't coming to mind this moment. I will just say that I loved it and I hope you guys did too! You can message me if you want to discuss certain moments or comment! Obviously I love reading and would love to discuss this instalment!"},

The characters. The story. The magic. But it is just not there.This review will naturally be spoiler free. So forgive me for being vague.It starts off well enough. We begin right where we left off. It's exciting. Through the opening conflicts, I was excited to see what this new generation had in store. It wasn't as great as the books. You don't have Rowling's effortless writing or the wealth of following the exact same characters, but this is the wizarding world. In a 5.5 hour play, there are so many possibilities ahead.Then it quickly nosedives into a tired and ridiculous plot. The Harry Potter series is full of enchanting and original adventure. Everything here, though, is too...easy. We retread familiar plots (both Potter and other). The scenes and character dynamics are predictable. There was no ingenuity or imagination here. I never felt joy. That was heartbreaking.But there are some diamonds in the rough here. For example, Scorpius Malfoy is an original, complex, and utterly \"Rowling-esque\" character. He fits right in to the world she has created over seven books. And towards the end, despite the play's steady decline into absurdity, there are some genuine and unexpected moments of pathos. I teared up a bit.But why? Was it because this play created an emotional build? Did I become attached to these characters? No. It was nostalgia. Nothing else. And that is the ultimate fault of this play. It never aims to work on its own. Each of Rowling's books have been able to stand on their own. They are each satisfying. They continue a larger narrative without sacrificing telling one, good story at a time. And this play has no interest in independence. It hopes to capture all the magic, emotion, and themes of Rowling's original work. But it just doesn't know how.So, this is an unfortunate disappointment. This is not \"the eighth story,\" and honestly, we never needed one. Some things are just more magical when left to the imagination.Update:I read this very quickly, so I did not get to digest the story while reading. I still stand by all the comments I made, but at the same time, I think I am going to reread it at some point this year to see if anything changes for me down the line."},

It was extremely fast-paced and I read this in a matter of hours in total. It was soooo heart-warming! By the way, was I the only one shipping Scorpius and Albus??? Too bad, they turned out to be straight in the end.. I really loved that both Albus and Scorpius were put in House Slytherin! Now I definitely want to become a Slytherin as well!The characters in this play were fantastic! Scorpius, ohhh Scorpius! He was without a doubt my favourite character! I loved him so much. He was very likeable and very sweet. I loved the complex relationship between Harry and his son, Albus. It made the play very believable. To see such a complex bond between father and son. Clearly there is love, they just have trouble understanding each other and expressing their feelings. I also really liked that the time-turner made us visit old characters from the past. That was the nicest part of the play, in my opinion. It was like visiting old friends. The eventual friendship between Harry and Draco was stunning. For them to become bonded because of the friendship between their sons! Ahhh, the feels.I loved the plot twist at the end!! Omg, Voldemort had a daughter!! That was insane. The whole plot of this play was so good and interesting. It never became a bore and it kept me interested till the very end. The funny thing was, I never really pictured a stage. I pictured all the scenes like I was reading a book. I saw Hogwarts and Godric's Hollow very vividly in my imagination. That being said, though, I desperately want to see this play being performed now!!I give this work 5 stars! Without a doubt. And WHAT... Rowling is going to publish more work in the Harry Potter world! Can't wait! "},

A hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 cheia de fan service legal. Basicamente todas as cenas do Ron e da Hermione s\u00e3o fofas, v\u00e1rios personagens que amamos aparecem, e alguns s\u00e3o apenas citados mas eu fiquei feliz em saber que est\u00e1 tudo bem com eles (Neville, te amo). Scorpius Malfoy \u00e9, sem d\u00favidas, a melhor coisa que saiu da exist\u00eancia dessa pe\u00e7a. Ele tem o carisma que o Harry nunca teve, \u00e9 bem humorado, sens\u00edvel e tem muita hist\u00f3ria por tr\u00e1s dele. Seria maravilhoso ler sete livros sobre o Scorpius e conhecer mais esse personagem. Mas \u00e9 claro que n\u00e3o temos a chance de conhecer Scorpius porque essa hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 ALL ABOUT HARRY FEELING SORRY. Como se sete livros n\u00e3o tivessem sido o bastante. O plot \u00e9 uma repeti\u00e7\u00e3o infinita de tudo que j\u00e1 vimos e as motiva\u00e7\u00f5es dos personagens s\u00e3o bem fracas.Sabe as IN\u00daMERAS teorias e piadas que n\u00f3s vimos ao longo do tempo do tipo \"JK Rowling, se voc\u00ea \u00e9 t\u00e3o esperta me responde: Pq n\u00e3o usaram o vira tempo pra matar Voldemort e tudo ficar bem de novo?????\"Com essa hist\u00f3ria ela nos responde essa quest\u00e3o, e a resposta \u00e9 insatisfat\u00f3ria e tudo se resolve de uma maneira \u00f3bvia e conveniente demais. S\u00e3o poucos os momentos de grande emo\u00e7\u00e3o e as suspresas s\u00e3o for\u00e7adas demais (e olha que eu li esse roteiro sem saber de spoiler nenhum).

Mas \u00e9 bem triste saber que essa hist\u00f3ria com cara de fanfic \u00e9 can\u00f4nica e, agora, faz parte do universo de Harry Potter. Sabe aquelas sequ\u00eancias de filme que saem para TV e ningu\u00e9m d\u00e1 muita bola? Tipo o terr\u00edvel \"Cinderela 3 - Uma Volta no Tempo\" (sim, existe). The Cursed Child \u00e9 exatamente isso. Uma sequ\u00eancia que n\u00e3o acrescenta muita coisa \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria original e revisita personagens que amamos e sentimos saudades. Mas, pra ser bem sincero, acho que vale mais a pena reler os sete livros e fingir que isso aqui n\u00e3o existe. Minha \u00fanica motiva\u00e7\u00e3o para amar a exist\u00eancia de Cursed Child era o relacionamento entre Albus e Scorpius. S\u00e9rio, gente. ALBUSCORPIUS TEM QUE SER REAL. Eu shipei esses dois com todas as minhas for\u00e7as, mas \u00e9 claro que no final (view spoiler)[os dois tinham que falar de NAMORADINHAS ETC, destruindo completamente meus sonhos de que no futuro eles fossem um maravilhoso casal de gays bruxos poderos\u00edssimos.

But this is 8th book and part of series, not a standalone, so I\u2019m going to treat it the same way as previous books. All in all, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a far cry from first seven Harry Potter books and definitely did not do original series a justice. And I can\u2019t believe that I would ever say no to more from this world but in my opinion, Harry Potter series should have ended with book #7.Yes, there were some scenes that I truly enjoyed. And yes, it was lovely to revisit my childhood heroes. However, whole storyline was way over the top. It brought nothing new only recycled old storylines. And worst of all, all characters seemed like caricatures of their old selves. And that was very very disappointing. Would I recommend it? Yes and no. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is not a bad book on its own, but as huge Harry Potter fan I have to say that this is absolutely unnecessary addition to otherwise one-of-a-kind series.MORE REVIEWS ON MY BLOG   Reading Is My Breathing"},

Using the least amount of words possible, a script speaks through dialogues as opposed to in the prose of the description and relies heavily on an actor's interpretation. There must exist nevertheless a pinch of flaw and reason, the precise rhythm and the proper flow. As much as the ambitious script of the Cursed Child is visually compelling, I can only consider the addition of a playscript, not actually penned by JK Rowling, to the memorable Harry Potter book series a mistake.Albus Severus Potter and Scorpious Malfoy engages in an unlikely adventure. And the prophetic past of great men they knew, may after all change all that stands now between good and evil. The boys set out to destroy the world, the boys set out to save the world. \u201cBravery doesn\u2019t forgive stupidity.\u201dThe script lacks in magic. Therefore shouldn't be necessarily claimed as the next big one of the series. The script instead deals with personal conflicts and yearning for redemption. Draco's finely executed transformation and his inherent contradiction demands praise. The burden of legacy often overpowers the young characters and they seek to define themselves anew. The philosophy behind the change of the tide is eloquently remembered.The characterization, except of Scorpious's and Draco's, mostly was humorless and lame in the most unmagical way possible. The introduction of Delphini served nothing. Our favourites were pitifully butchered. And there remained an unrealistic setting for the story to progress. On the other hand, a script is meant to be staged and the acting of the performers eventually outdoes the script's natural stiffness.  \u201cIn every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\u201dIn the Deathly Hallows, we bade an incredible adieu to the brave boy who lived. To the unwavering friendship in times of doubt and mortal peril. To the courage the boy mustered to choose life in the face of inevitable death. To the good heart and its nobility, that made in the end all the difference.The magic for us, did end there, at the King's Cross Station for good."},

(Where he got to be one of that boy's many many parental figures) James Jr.?? He's got the experience of being a loving dad. d) He knows what NOT to do aka: the Dursleys. Fight me on this if you will but I stand by the idea that HP would be a brilliant dad.4. Hermione and Ron felt sooo 2D. Ron was just a comic relief and basically turned into a replacement Fred where was his Bloody Hell! personality? Hermione was far too strict. YES, she's a bit bossy but this just felt too far. I know I know her work at the ministry probably puts a lot of strain on her but once again Hermione is compassionate more than anything!5. Don't get me wrong I love the idea of Scorpius and Rose but Scorpius and Albus was a seriously missed opportunity. The only things I really liked was a) SCORPIUS. What a sweetheart. So cute. and b) Hermione and Ron's eternal love for each other no matter what timeline. I feel like this needed to be reiterated after the 'Hermione should've been with Harry' bomb from a while ago. Overall, I don't think I'm counting this as canon. It might technically be, but personally I've read some better fan fiction. "},

Albus Severus Potter feels the weight of his fathers success on his shoulders every day, and even more so now that he will start his magical journey at Hogwarts. He has grown up with the stories of the incredibly strong friendship of his father, his Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron. He knows that in order to survive in Hogwarts, to be happy and to feel like he belongs there, he needs to find a friend. Someone worthy, someone that understands him, someone that would listen and not judge him. And he does. He finds the boy no one wants to get associated with. He finds Scorpius Malfoy, and yet theirs is a rather unlikely pact, it's also strong and full of love.Disappointed.How can you manage to do that to a freakish Potterhead who's been obsessed with anything and everything Harry Potter since the age of 8?I believe we've been cheated into believing we'd be getting our hands onto another brilliant story from the pen of JK Rowling. I refuse to believe Rowling even touched this script. I can't even understand HOW on earth she approved of this mockery and let them put her name on it. This is not Harry Potter.This right here feels like nothing but a blatant cash grab. Regardless of how great the stage production and the acting may be, the plot was weak, predictable, dull and most importantly a break from book canon. It is nothing more than a very poorly written fan-fiction. Too much pandering and not enough concrete story. The main conflict is ludicrous, the side conflicts more so...Some characterization and dialogues were way off, painfully absurd and cringe-worthy. Especially the way Ron Weasley was reduced to an absent-minded lackey, and was so irrelevant and useless. I can forgive every wrong about this...even the whole Moldy Voldy \u201ctwist\u201d, but not THAT. Never that. Undermining a main character who we've grown to love is unacceptable. Don't get me wrong. I am SO grateful for another glimpse into the wizarding world, I am, but this script does in no way measure upto the novels. Kind of underwhelming.   OVERALL: The incredibly cute friendship of lovely Scorpius (who is officially in my favourite HP characters top 5 list now) and Albus, my delusional LGBT ship (which sadly didn't happen at the end, even while all the hints were there) and some of the scenes where Harry gets closure with people that we've lost made reading this book WORTH IT. Read it. But lower your expectations, and don't forget that it's just a screenplay, and that it might feel more MAGICAL on screen!"},

Short observation with longer thoughts to follow\u2026 book and movie lovers of the original Potter series will notice many Easter Eggs. What I loved especially is that both the books and the movies were referenced. As book fans know\u2026 a movie doesn't capture everything in the book and the movies may add things that were not in the books to begin with. (Hi, shrunken heads! LOL u0026lt;\u2014 excellent edition, btw). So, we see this subtle nod to both franchises.Longer review below:I always felt Rowling wasn't sure she wanted to go back to her original series because if it ain't broke, why fix it? As a fan you can tell she was having this push and pull with the idea. An encyclopedia was planned, but we got Pottermore that you can not really easily flip through and refer to certain things without getting very lost. It serves as a wonderful tool for Rowling to dispense related items to her Potterverse without having fully to commit to another series. Which is bitter sweet for fans because you are getting loads of backstory that was not included in any of the series but with no solid foundation. I find that frustrating because I believe she should expand from the series both before the original series and after. Yet. As we know, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is being expanded upon from a very small book to a three part movie, with novels accompanying the movies as they go along. Very nice and not something I would complain about since it is more Potterverse items.But what we all wanted was the continuation of the series we loved (well not all of us, but a lot of us). I am still holding out for a book or several on the Maunders being a prequel to the original HP series. I am holding my breath I guess! I digress, we are blessed with a play that happens 19 years later and picks exactly where the epilogue in Deathly Hallows leaves off with the same exact scene. Love it! Like I mentioned before and I felt this while reading Cursed Child\u2026 I feel Rowling wants to return to this series but I almost wonder she doubts herself and her fandom. There was so much going on in this play that could and should be expanded out into more in-depth novels. This play covers more than a couple of years and though it doesn't concentrate solely on the Golden Trios and supporting characters' children\u2026 we do back to Hogwarts. So many questions spring up from that alone? What does Hogwarts look like today? Is it vastly different or look the same after the battle? (remember I am a book reader and have not seen the play with it's accompanying sets\u2026 so I do not know nor will most of us in this case because we are a play transcript as of right now). How old is Professor McGonagall and can she fill us in on this longevity surviving how many wiazrding wars now? The lady is made of steel! All fun aside\u2026 here come the spoilers and you have been warned\u2026 (view spoiler)[ The Golden Trio expands for someone who everyone knows was always looking from the outside in and gets his wish to be part of the cool kids group. Love it! And though I did put a spoiler tag, if you don't get that vague reference, then you are not a true Potter fan. Sorry, not sorry. :PAn unlikely friendship is forged by a Potter and a Malfoy offspring and that makes my heart sing. We do not bare the sins our fathers made and this book speaks to that throughout regarding both Harry and Draco. Many people may not like this play/book because of that\u2026 but that is the reality in any way you cut this. Those beloved main characters are now adults with families and two of the major male characters had either no parents or incredibly shitty parents that didn't now a thing about parenting. So, take those children out of their childhood and have them raising their own kids in somewhat normal circumstances and you are going to have conflict. Not because they are bad people, but because they were brought up in terrible situations. I like seeing that dynamic because we are all living in a fantasy world within a fantasy world if that is not touched upon especially with Harry Potter and Draco MalfoyLong Story short: We may need Doc Brown to explain the space time continuum because the time turner may have replaced the Delorean. No joke, while reading, I kept thinking about Back to the Future. . (hide spoiler)]Back to Rowling and why this play needs to go beyond the stage or even screen (because I can see this going the movie route) and back to the page where it all began. Rowling is expanding her talent and I love that, but as someone who is a booklover, I selfishly want more because this play has more to offer than it gives. How do you top Voldemort? By exploring some of his own family roots and I ain't talking about his mommy and daddy. That's all you get from me because you have to read the play to know what I am talking about. By what Rowling and the other writers did, was open this play up for a potential for many other books. I can't see a second play being made (maybe they will), but a book series to expand from when we are back on Platform 9 3/4 to the ending of this play and outward. However, a character that was introduced for this play specifically could carry several new books. Which most likely will happen because as we know 'He Who Shall Remain Nameless' wasn't a one and done deal. *wink* Also, when everyone reads this, can we all sit and talk about this particular situation? Seriously, I have so many questions and I know fellow readers are going to go \"OH, Really? Right, okay. Interesting. Crazy. Trying to erase that image from my mind\u2026 thanks.\"I was very pleased and enjoyed returning to this series. It makes me want Rowling to sit down and write prequels and sequels in her original form\u2026 the novel. Please, Jo! The transcript is well written enough to envision what is going on and how the play sets move from one scene to another without being confused. Which is excellent because many of us will not see the stage production of this. Which I am fine with in a way because it is how we all came to love the books before the movies came out. The writing at times could be a bit cheesy but we have to remember that this is still a children's/teen series. Nonetheless, character growth is shown in many places. I want more and I might have to wait another 10 years cause Rowling loves to play mind games not only with her fans but herself as well. Go, figure! Ha! We all know Rowling is better at long story arcs that cover several books, i.e. her Potter series and Cormoran Strike novels and not so good with stand alone\u2026 i.e. The Casual Vacancy. An excellent book in a series I know I never want to end. Thank you Jo for giving us a bit more. Here's to hoping we get more. ;)[ The Golden Trio expands for someone who everyone knows was always looking from the outside in and gets his wish to be part of the cool kids group. Love it!

Eventually I had to wait until J.K. Rowling wrote each one, and although I tried to demonstrate some self-control, I'd usually devour them fairly quickly. When the last book was released, I think I waited about six months to read it, because I couldn't fathom the idea of not having any more time with Harry, Hermione, Ron, and the gang. But then I broke down, read it, and broke down again (emotionally).So when   Harry Potter and the Cursed Child came out, you'd think I might want to hoard it for a while, especially in light of Rowling's recent announcement that this would be the last story in the series. Well, I just couldn't. It's Harry freaking Potter, for pity's sake! But given my attachment to the series, would this new story\u2014a play, to boot\u2014live up to my expectations? Would the chemistry between the characters feel the same? Would this generate the same emotional reactions I've felt before?Yes, yes, and yes.  Harry Potter and the Cursed Child takes place 19 years after the last book. Harry is married with three children (if you've still not read the last book in the series, I'll not spoil the surprise of who his wife is), and is barely keeping things afloat as a high-level employee at the Ministry of Magic. His younger son, Albus Severus Potter, is about to start Hogwarts, and isn't too keen on the legacy of being Harry Potter's son following him through school. It doesn't take him long to distinguish himself as utterly different than his father, and his choice of best friend causes him even more alienation at the hands of his fellow students.As his time at Hogwarts rolls on, Albus grows more and more disenchanted with school and his father. After an argument with Harry one night, Albus makes a decision in the heat of the moment that he wants to undo a wrong his father caused a number of years ago. Little does he know this will set into motion a chain of events which will cause the present, the past, and the future to collide, bringing the threat of danger, grief, loss, and the possible return of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. All in all, it's a lot to face.I'll stop here with the plot description for fear of giving anything away. I absolutely loved this story. Even though it was a little strange reading it as a play rather than a book, I got the old, familiar feelings as I was reading, became both excited and melancholy as old characters returned, and definitely was struck by suspense and trepidation as I wondered how the plot would wrap itself up. This is definitely more a book about Albus than it is about Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco, and the rest, but it still touches on the Potter-esque themes of friendship, hope, anger, abandonment, grief, and fear.\"People think they know all there is to know about you, but the best bits of you are\u2014have always been\u2014heroic in really quiet ways.\"This is truly a perfect quote to sum up what is so special about Harry Potter. I'm so glad to have had another chance to spend even a short amount of time with these characters, back in their world. I hope Rowling will reconsider again allowing the world more visits with Harry and crew, but until then, this was a worthy nugget to hold on to.

Sembra che Albus sia invidioso di James ed un po' anche di Lily (perch\u00e9 pure lei \u00e8 stata smistata a grifondoro, tranne il piccolo albus insomma anche i muri di casa Potter sono stati smistati a grifondoro) quindi semplicemente non ci parla. Punto. Non ci dice nemmeno come \u00e8 il rapporto in famiglia, semplicemente vengono cancellati dopo le primissime 10 pagine.Davvero ridicolo che alla fine Harry dica che suo figlio James non gli assomigli affatto, perch\u00e9 Harry precisa di aver dovuto sempre faticare per ottenere dei risultati, proprio come Albus! ...aspettate, come Albus?! Albus ha dovuto faticare? Non mi sembra, chiaramente deve essermi sfuggito vediamo di fare due conti. Albus fa un piano e quel piano miracolosamente subito funziona anche (o meglio sopratutto) quando questo piano \u00e8 impossibile. Ad esempio entra al ministero fischiettando 'i'm walking on sunshineee whoooa!' ed assolutamente nessuno lo nota, anche se \u00e8 stato cos\u00ec geniale da prendere, con i suoi amici, le sembianze di una persona famosa come Harry Potter e del ministro della magia aka Hermione, insomma persone sconosciute che nessuno noterebbe. Qual \u00e8 il suo piano geniale? la polisucco! dico geniale perch\u00e9 \u00e8 una pozione mai usata nella storia di HP quindi avr\u00e0 fatto piacere a tutti scommetto ritrovarla tra le scatole (che colpo di scena, eh?). Si ecco, ovviamente ci vuole un mese per fare una pozione polisucco, ed ovviamente normali studenti non la sanno fare! ma questo non conta niente perch\u00e9 per Albus u0026amp; friends \u00e8 tutto fattibile. Anche perch\u00e9 la storia avanza veloce come l'espresso di Hogwarts quindi non ci sarebbe stato tempo per inventare qualche cosa di meno banale della polisucco, contando che in 200 pagine passiamo ben cinque anni di Hogwarts e quattro li facciamo nelle prime quaranta pagine. Non mi lamento, insomma pensate che tortura sette libri con Albus Severus come protagonista?! Nonostante le misure di sicurezza di Hogwarts (ai suoi tempi si diceva che non esisteva posto pi\u00f9 sicuro di Hogwarts) Albus riesce a far entrare Delphi nella foresta proibita come fosse niente (effettivamente si era gi\u00e0 preso gioco delle divese di un altro posto che avrebbe dovuto essere impenetrabile come il Ministero con una banalissima polisucco, si spererebbe che dopo tutte le cose successe in passato qualcuno avesse pensato a delle misure di sicurezza con una grazia? ed invece no. Cio\u00e8 Hermione ministro della magia, Hermione la stessa che \u00e8 entrata nel Ministero ai tempi di Voldemort proprio con una polisucco non ha pensato a mettere qualche cosa che impedisse alal gente di entrare e fare i suoi porci comodi con una cosa come una polisucco? Insomma Hermione che ci stai a fare l\u00ec allora?! Per spiegare brevemente l'incredibile fortuna che accompagna Albus per tutto il libro dico solo che se Albus fosse stato il protagonista dei primi sette libri al posto di Harry sarebbe salito sulla barca per Hogwarts gi\u00e0 con la pietra filosofale in tasca ed avrebbe rotto il primo horcrux prima ancora di venire smistato.Il \"piano della coperta\" poi \u00e8 cos\u00ec sbagliato che nemmeno spiego nei dettagli quanto sia completamente sbagliato (suggerimento: si ogni punto), dico solamente che era impossibile che Harry proprio in un momento del genere con tutte le cose da fare ed a cui pensare, con il figlio disperso, eccetra eccetra andasse in camera del figlio (dove a detta di ginny NON poteva entrare) a prendere proprio quella coperta che non gli serviva a niente in quel momento ed oltretutto si mettesse a leggere, perch\u00e9 guarda una coperta in cui non c'\u00e8 mai stato niente vediamo un po' se appare qualche scritta. Impossibile.La descrizione che vogliono darci di Albus \u00e8 'poor kid has saved the world' quando per colpa sua \u00e8 successo tutto, per colpa sua \u00e8 morto un ragazzino, per colpa sua a momenti morivano tutti. Avrebbe dovuto essere mandato fuori da Hogwats a calci in culo, ma ovviamente \u00e8 figlio di Harry Potter quindi pacca sulla spalla e 'non farlo pi\u00f9 campione, va bene?'. Ovvio.La differenza fondamentale tra Harry ed il suo inutile figlio \u00e8 che Harry faceva cose illegali non perch\u00e9 voleva ma perch\u00e9 era costretto, Albus invece non rispetta una regola che sia una. Lo hanno appena punito con una pacca sulla spalla dopo che ha fatto un casino incredibile? perfetto! il secondo dopo gi\u00e0 sparisce di nuovo a combinare altri danni! Il bello \u00e8 che nessuno lo vede come uno che fa come gli pare e piace, no! Albus \u00e8 l'eroe!Il pezzo nella realt\u00e0 alternativa con Snape mi ha fatto talmente ridere che boh.Snape cos\u00ec OOC che nemmeno nelle fanfiction. Quando gli dicono che \u00e8 morto lui 'vabb\u00e9 fa niente, sono morto da eroe no? quindi che problema c'\u00e8?' eeeh chi non prenderebbe la cosa cos\u00ec irrealisticamente bene?. Snape che dava della mezzosangue ad Hermione anche nell'ultimo libro mentre parlava con il quadro di Silente ora improvvisamente \u00e8 amicone di tutti, ammira Hermione (che a quanto pare non considera miracolosamente pi\u00f9 una dal sangue sporco) e fa battutine con Ron (non si sono mai potuti reggere a vicenda), insomma non so chi sia quello ma chiaramente non \u00e8 il personaggio complesso che era Severus Snape.Dato che ho citato Ron ed Hermione parliamo della figlia, ovvero Rose, ovvero personaggio inutile e odioso che scommetto non \u00e8 piaciuta a nessuno. Non prende il premio come peggior personaggio del libro perch\u00e9 per fortuna sparisce dopo 10 pagine, altrimenti lo sarebbe stata visto l'andazzo prometteva di essere uno di quei personaggi che prenderesti volentieri a badilate sui denti. Il modo in cui tratta Albus \u00e8 inqualificabile 'facciamo gli amiconi solo finch\u00e9 ci guardano i grandi, poi non provare a guardarmi eh!', anche perch\u00e9 non ha nessuna ragione per odiare fino a questo punto Albus (che fino ad allora non aveva dato tendenze insopportabili) ed oltretutto \u00e8 stata tirata su da due genitori che mi sono sempre sembrati piuttosto aperti mentalmente e non cos\u00ec pronti ad affossare gli altri per \"salvarsi la faccia\" e passare per quelli cool della scuola. Hermione e Ron che andavano in giro con Harry anche quando tutta Hogwarts gli andava (ripetutamente) contro ora hanno una figlia che fa la bulletta, ottimo proprio quello che volevo scoprire.Il fatto che prenda in giro Scorpius e che lui le muoia anche dietro alla fine \u00e8 una poracceria incredibile. Poi mi raccomando deve precisare sempre che lei \u00e8 una Granger, sia mai che sia presa per una Weasley visto che i Weasley e sopratutto Ron sono trattati come la peggio merda in questo libro. Non \u00e8 che Albus \u00e8 chiamato un Potter-Weasley perch\u00e9 di Ginny chiaramente non importa a nessuno, per\u00f2 che Rose sia una GRANGER-Weasley invece mettiamolo chiarissimo fin da subito e sottolineamo sopratutto che \u00e8 una Granger nel caso qualcuno malauguratamente dovesse ricordare che \u00e8 figlia pure di Ron!A proposito di Ginny: povera, povera Ginny! mai piaciuta nei vecchi libri di HP, ma piazzarla in questo libro e renderla inutile pure qui che senso ha?! come nei vecchi libri solo che peggio.Non solo non conta niente nell'educazione dei figli (e nemmeno nei loro nomi visto che li ha chiaramente scelti TUTTI harry) ma oltretutto ha pure il coraggio di accusare il marito se hanno un figlio fuori di capoccia come Albus. Davvero Harry, tuo figlio \u00e8 odioso, ti dice che ti odia, ti incolpa dei suoi fallimenti, dice che non vorrebbe essere tuo figlio come OSI rispondere e dire che anche a te lui ha rotto le scatole? suvvia, dovevi dire che aveva ragione lui e dargliela buona infondo non sta affatto crescendo viziato no? Esatto.Scorpius clamorosamente personaggio migliore del libro, dico clamorosamente perch\u00e9 pensavo fosse il Draco 2.0 invece del padre non ha niente (per fortuna). Sarebbe un incrocio tra un tassorosso ed un corvonero ma indovinate in che casa finisce? serpeverde ovviamente. Perch\u00e9 JK conosce solo due case: Serpeverde e Grifondoro, tutte le altre sono FUFFA! E poi si chiede come mai nessuno vuole Tassorosso, cavolo quando hai la possibilit\u00e0 rifare la storia e mettere finalmente qualcuno anche nei corvi e nei tassi che fai? niente ovviamente, tutti grifi e serpi come al solito! La sua cotta per Rose \u00e8 senza senso, se ne invaghisce subito e sembra uno stupido vicino a lei perch\u00e9 lei lo offende, gli da due di picche, ecc. e lui sembra felice di essere mandato educatamente a quel paese. Il suo rapporto con Rose \u00e8 inesistente, davvero perch\u00e9 forzare la romance a questo modo proprio non l'ho capito (dubito che ci sia qualcuno che shippi Rose/Scorpius per le loro interazioni nel libro).Ciligina sulla torta: Harry u0026amp; Co. sono usciti DISTRUTTI da questo libro, il magico trio non \u00e8 pi\u00f9 tanto magico per niente.Il rapporto Harry/Ron \u00e8 INESISTENTE. Vi ricordate Ron ed Harry, migliori amici sempre ad aiutarci a vicenda, sempre pronti uno per l'altro? Dimenticateveli. In pratica non si parlano, ma quando si parlano non direste mai e poi mai che sono migliori amici. Al massimo si nota un lieve amicizia Harry/Hermione ma basta, niente che faccia ricordare i bei tempi d'oro.Draco \u00e8 un altro personaggio che leggendo il libro ho pensato: ma tu chi sei? perch\u00e9 ti Draco Malfoy non \u00e8 che hai poi molto. Capisco il voler far \"redimere\" un personaggio che non era positivo ma che ai fan era piaciuto molto, ma cos\u00ec non so a me \u00e8 sembrato praticamente azzerato e molto noioso. Diceva spesso cose giuste in compenso, tipo quandoo che si lamenta della posizione di Hermione come ministro della magia mi ha trovato incredibilmente d'accordo, insomma \u00e8 indubbio che sia una maga capace ma dimostra in questo libro quanto poco fosse pronta ad una posizione di comando (tenere una giratempo perch\u00e9 pensavi ce ne fosse un'altra? davvero JK? una scusa migliore proprio non c'era?).Il povero Ron invece merita un paragrafo a parte perch\u00e9 povero povero povero Ron! Sembra un idiota in questo libro. Ron che \u00e8 stato prefetto di Grifondoro deve per forza passare come il cretino del gruppo. E' indubbio che JK lo ami meno degli altri due membri del trio: tutti ovviamente sono di successo tranne Ron, che anche lui rimane deluso nella realt\u00e0 alternativa quado gli dicono che lavorer\u00e0 per un negozio di scherzi. Pensava quello che pensavamo tutti; 'insomma Harry ha raccomandato mezzo mondo ma a me essere migliore amico del bambino che \u00e8 sopravissuto non ha portato un cavolo di vantaggio?' no, infatti. Ha 40 anni ma si comporta in maniera pi\u00f9 immatura di quando ne aveva 11, crisi di mezza et\u00e0?Il suo problema poi \u00e8 la coppia Ron/Hermeione perch\u00e9 vedere gente sul web impazzire per la Dramione per una singola frase e fare certi commenti mi ha fatta molto sorridere. Insomma Ron ed Hermione in questo libro si amano anche quando lui \u00e8 sposato con un'alttra donna in una realt\u00e0 alternativa, si baciano pi\u00f9 di ogni altra coppia del libro, lui le chiede di sposarlo una seconda volta giusto per ripetere il matrimonio, decide di rimanere con Hermione e di morire assieme a lei pur di non abbandonarla (quando potrebbe fuggire e salvarsi la vita), ecc. ma 'Romione non sono una coppia!1 Hermione merita di meglio!\" ma quando Draco dice che gli piace venire comandato a bacchetta da Hermione 'Dramione \u00e8 cos\u00ec bella!! vedo l'amore u0026lt;u0026lt;3' ok, siete strani.Se Harry difende Ginny oltretutto \u00e8 cos\u00ec 'coraggioso, oh Harry cos\u00ec innamorato!' se Ron fa la stessa cosa con Hermione \u00e8 impiccione, doveva pensare ai fatti suoi, omg \u00e8 di nuovo Ron che dice cose senza usare il cervello! Hermione sa difendersi da sola, che pensavi Ron? Insomma boh, non so che pesi e misure usi chi ha scritto questa cosa, ma chiaramente sono tutti sfasati.Perch\u00e9 quando Hermione non si mette con Ron passa da ministro della Magia a insegnante di Hogwarts? fatico a capire il collegamento, casomai il contrario era pi\u00f9 fattibile. Se hai dei figli e vuoi occuparti di loro (cosa che comunque Hermione non ha fatto visto che ha detto che se ne \u00e8 occupato solo Ron) dovrai ridimensionare le tue ambizioni, ma se non sei sposata e sei capace ed ambiziosa come Hermione \u00e8 allora che cosa ti ferma?!Dobbiamo proprio parlare di Delphi poi? dobbiamo? va bene: Delphi ridicola, partendo dal nome arrivando a tutto il resto.Nessuno si chiede come \u00e8 possibile che questa sia apparsa dal nulla, ma non ha amici, parenti, qualcuno Amos Diggory?! che poi una con i capelli di quel colore si dovrebbe notare, no!? e invece no. Poi viene allevata da due mangiamorte estremisti, scusate ma come \u00e8 possibile che questi due visto che erano pro Voldemort e lo sapevano TUTTI non solo non li hanno sbattuti ad Azkaban ma gli hanno fatto pure crescere una bambina?! Strega super brillante poi a quanti anni? \u00e8 una ragazzina ed a momenti fa il culo ad Harry Potter, vabb\u00e9 non \u00e8 una forzatura giuro!Altre cose senza senso;Theodre Nott mangiamorte cos\u00ec a random poi, quando la Rowling non lo aveva dipinto in un estratto con Draco mai uscito ufficialmente come uno assolutamente non interessato a Voldemort ed ai mangiamorte? (al contrario di Draco). Sembra che abbia detto: \"chi dei vecchi personaggi di HP posso riutilizzare? oh t\u00f2! c'\u00e8 theodore nott, usiamolo tanto nessuno si ricorder\u00e0 nemmeno di sia!\" geniale proprio.Senza senso voler sminuire Lucius e Narcissa, quando per quanto personaggi negativi hanno sempre avuto come qualit\u00e0 che li poteva redimere l'amore per il figlio ora improvvisamente nemmeno quello cos\u00ec senza motivo (per rendere Draco un po' emo e solitario probabilmente). Il Voldemort day, siete seri?Cedric mangiamorte! insomma tassorosso GIUSTI E LEALI, ma dato che ha fatto un figurone di merda al torneo dei tre maghi allora diventa malvagio BUAHAHAH. Ha senso? No direi, io ne ho fatte di figure di merda in vita mia questo non mi ha fatto diventare un serial killer (ed io oltretutto non verrei nemeno mai smistata a tassorosso, quindi ho pi\u00f9 possibilit\u00e0 di cedric di diventare mangiamorte sicuramente). Oltretutto non diventa mangiamorte dopo come tutti, cio\u00e8 non \u00e8 che dopo quando voldemort sale al potere uno ha paura e dice 'chi me lo fa fare di ribellarmi? non ce l'ha con me, se sto buono almeno posso vivere' no! lo fa PRIMA! perch\u00e9 alla battaglia di hogwarts cedric era gi\u00e0 un mangiamorte ed ha addirittura ucciso neville (neville che \u00e8 uno dei personaggi importanti di hp, neville che insegna ad hogwarts dove succedono le cose, neville che giustamente non ha nemmeno UNA battuta!). Si perch\u00e9 dopo una figura di merda uno a 18 anni decide di andare ad uccidere ragazzini, HA SENSO! ...solo che non ne ha. Ci rendiamo conto di quanto ha voluto distruggere un personaggio, L'UNICO personaggio che aveva dato ai tassorosso ovviamente? Taassorosso ribellatevi!Ho aspettato tutti questi anni per questa cosa? Sai che ti dico JK? il libro dei malandrini se devi farlo cos\u00ec non lo voglio pi\u00f9."},

Para m\u00ed la historia de Harry ya se termin\u00f3 con las Reliquias de la Muerte, todo lo dem\u00e1s es fan-fiction. Peeero, como los libros de Harry Potter fueron grandes responsables de que hoy tenga el h\u00e1bito de leer pr\u00e1cticamente todos los d\u00edas, inevitablemente ten\u00eda que leer este \"libro\". Lo primero que tengo que decir es que fue muy lindo volver a leer una historia ambientada en el universo creado por Rowling, fue como reencontrarse con viejos amigos. Al igual que me sucedi\u00f3 cuando era chico devor\u00e9 este libro en apenas una noche, algo que hoy en d\u00eda me resulta dif\u00edcil. En ese sentido la magia de Harry Potter est\u00e1 intacta, fue imposible despegarme de esta historia una vez que me acostumbr\u00e9 al hecho de que en realidad no es una novela, sino el gui\u00f3n de una obra de teatro. Lo cual me lleva a hablar de la estructura del libro. Al principio me result\u00f3 un poco inc\u00f3modo, y extra\u00f1\u00e9 much\u00edsimo las descripciones extensas, perderme en aquel maravilloso mundo lleno de magia. Obviamente, por tratarse de un gui\u00f3n, se saltean muchas cosas que hubiesen sido interesantes de conocer en detalle (los dos primeros a\u00f1os de Albus en Hogwarts pasan en un par de p\u00e1ginas, por ejemplo). Por suerte, acostumbrarme a la forma en que est\u00e1 escrito no se me hizo tan dif\u00edcil como pensaba, y en apenas un par de cap\u00edtulos me enganch\u00e9 como con cualquier otra historia de Harry Potter. Hasta ah\u00ed todo bien, pero luego est\u00e1 el peque\u00f1o gran inconveniente de esta historia: el contenido. Todo me pareci\u00f3 muy tra\u00eddo de los pelos y hubo un mont\u00f3n de cosas que no tienen ning\u00fan sentido (que obviamente no voy a revelar para no spoilear). Sinceramente hubo algunos \"giros\" que no sorprenden para nada y muchas cosas convenientemente inventadas para esta historia que no son coherentes con los libros anteriores. En vez de ser una historia original, con nuevas aventuras y centrada en nuevos personajes, la obra recurre a hechos anteriores y apela m\u00e1s bien a la nostalgia que uno siente por el universo de Harry Potter en lugar de intentar algo innovador (seguramente por miedo a cagarla).Ejemplo de esto \u00faltimo hay varios a lo largo de toda la obra: aparecen algunos viejos personajes muy queridos por los fans, pero que en mi opini\u00f3n no tienen cabida en la historia o son completamente diferentes a como eran en los libros anteriores; como que son demasiado \"acartonados\" y unidimensionales (de nuevo, posiblemente se deba a que es un gui\u00f3n y no estoy acostumbrado a leer este tipo de textos). Si algo disfrut\u00e9 de los libros de Harry Potter fue esa mezcla de misterio y magia, con las revelaciones al final de cada libro que te dejaban boquiabierto. Por desgracia, nada de eso ocurre en este libro.Por suerte los personajes nuevos (sobre todo Scorpius Malfoy) y el emotivo final hacen que esta historia valga la pena, de lo contrario estar\u00eda ante uno de los peores libros que le\u00ed en los \u00faltimos a\u00f1os. Calificaci\u00f3n 5/10:Como parte de la saga, Harry Potter y el Ni\u00f1o Maldito deja mucho que desear. En lugar de intentar crear algo nuevo, recurre a eventos de los libros anteriores para basar pr\u00e1cticamente toda su trama. Hay muchos detalles que se pierden por tratarse de una obra de teatro y otros aspectos que simplemente son producto de la falta de ideas. Estoy siendo generoso con la calificaci\u00f3n porque me encant\u00f3 reencontrarme con Harry, Ron y Hermione, y el m\u00e1gico mundo creado por J. K Rowling. Sin embargo, si consideramos este libro como parte de la saga, resulta espantoso; parece escrito por un fan\u00e1tico debido a ciertos cameos que no tienen mucho sentido y otros giros que resultan muy poco cre\u00edbles.Personalmente prefiero hacer de cuenta que este libro es una historia extra y que no forma parte de la saga."},

Y no s\u00e9 si esperaba algo o no de \u00e9l, pero a m\u00ed me ha chiflado y me muero por verlo representado, que es cuando creo que podr\u00e1 disfrutar de la historia al cien por cien.La octava historia, diecinueve a\u00f1os despu\u00e9s. Y es precisamente eso lo que nos encontramos: otra historia. No la considero continuaci\u00f3n, sino una parte m\u00e1s de la historia del mundo m\u00e1gico y, en espec\u00edfico, de las familias y amigos del tr\u00edo protagonista de la saga principal. Lo primero que hay que tener en cuenta es que Harry Potter and the Cursed Child es un gui\u00f3n. No se puede leer sin tener en cuenta todos los factores que se a\u00f1aden a la historia, como las interpretaciones de los actores y actrices, la iluminaci\u00f3n, el movimiento y el propio escenario. Por lo tanto, hay que leerlo sabiendo y entendiendo que faltan muchos elementos, y que la octava historia no se puede valorar realmente hasta verla representada, porque todo lo que aporta la descripci\u00f3n o el propio formato de novela no se puede encontrar aqu\u00ed.Sea necesario o no (qu\u00e9 tonter\u00eda, por cierto, el arte en todas sus formas siempre es necesario), creo que un mundo como el que cre\u00f3 Rowling hace tantos a\u00f1os y que ha seguido creciendo sin parar en la cultura popular puede y merece ser recuperado las veces que se quiera. No ten\u00eda que estar a la altura de los dem\u00e1s libros, porque simplemente no puede: no es una novela, las novelas acabaron con el s\u00e9ptimo libro y eso lo sabemos todos. Esto es, simplemente, otra cosa. He re\u00eddo con las bromas de Ron, me he emocionado con algunas escenas maravillosas (\u00a1la p\u00e1gina 137 es perfecta, no hay m\u00e1s que imaginarla en vivo!), he alucinado imagin\u00e1ndome c\u00f3mo llevar\u00edan a cabo algunas acotaciones sobre hechizos y otras indicaciones m\u00e1s propias de un gui\u00f3n de cine que de teatro y me he enamorado de los nuevos personajes, m\u00e1s de unos que de otros.Algunas acotaciones son pura magia. Llama la atenci\u00f3n que sean precisamente los fragmentos de texto que no est\u00e1n pensados para decirse en voz alta, sino que son puras indicaciones para representaci\u00f3n, los que pueden considerarse m\u00e1s literarios dentro de la obra. Por eso es genial leerlo, porque las acotaciones tienen tantos detalles y transmiten tantas sensaciones que uno puede imagin\u00e1rselo a su manera pero siempre como algo llen\u00edsimo de magia.Scorpius Malfoy me ha robado el coraz\u00f3n. Ese chico que solo quiere un amigo, el chico gracioso y t\u00edmido y valiente que lo dar\u00eda todo por las personas que quiere. Para m\u00ed es \u00e9l el verdadero protagonista de la obra, y no Albus o Harry. Y en cuanto a los dem\u00e1s, me ha gustado mucho ver c\u00f3mo han evolucionado las relaciones entre los personajes que ya conoc\u00edamos, y tambi\u00e9n poder descubrir c\u00f3mo llevan sus nuevos roles, ya sea de trabajadores del ministerio o como padres y madres de una nueva generaci\u00f3n de la que me hubiera gustado ver mucho m\u00e1s, pero para la que hay tiempo y aventuras suficientes esperando.Como punto negativo, es verdad que algunos puntos de la trama se pasan un poco por alto y no se tratan en profundidad. Sin embargo, como ya he dicho, esto no es una novela. El tiempo en una obra de teatro no se trata de igual manera que una novela, y todos los elementos de la historia deben adaptarse al formato. Por lo tanto, es normal que se centre la atenci\u00f3n en los personajes y sus relaciones y se deje un poco m\u00e1s de lado que todas las tramas se traten extensamente; la acci\u00f3n no es m\u00e1s que una excusa para mostrar las relaciones entre padres y madres y sus hijos e hijas, al igual que entre amigos, que es la base de toda la obra de Rowling. Y es precisamente esa amistad sin l\u00edmites con lo que me quedo de Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. Nadie puede destruirla, ni si quiera el paso del tiempo."},

If you don't want any spoilers, I would suggest you just don't read this review and skip to someone else's but if you don't mind getting spoilers or you've already read it/seen the play and you're intrigued by my opinion then go ahead. I will be starting with the things I liked and then moving onto the things I didn't.The things I liked:1. Scorpius Malfoy. How could I not love him? How could anyone not love him? Although, I don't really understand how he was a Slytherin. He clearly fitted Hufflepuff or Ravenclaw better but then I guess A) he may not have met Albus and become such good friends and B) the Harry Potter books have always overlooked Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw as secondary houses, with the exception of Luna and a few side characters.2. Draco Malfoy. I fully support the idea that Draco would've turned himself round and been a great and accepting Dad. We saw his hesitations when he was younger, we saw how he realised in Half Blood Prince that he wasn't cut out for the life his Father wanted for him, we saw in Deathly Hallows how he realised he was on the wrong side and changed his way. I am in full support of this portrayal of him as someone who as an adult is accepting of their child no matter what and who raised a good, decent human being because he realised the errors of his Fathers ways and learnt from his own mistakes. Draco Malfoy that marries a woman that his Father doesn't approve of and who protects and cares about his wife and child so fiercely and passionately is the Draco Malfoy that I am on board with. 100%.3. The scene with Hagrid when he picks up baby Harry to take him to the Dursleys because that was too precious for this world. Hagrid is too precious for this world.4. The plot was fairly fun and entertaining. I read it incredibly fast and found it hard to put down.5. Some of the quotes and lines were good. I liked Draco and Ginny opening up about their experiences and how they felt at Hogwarts. I liked that every timeline they ended up in, Hermione and Ron still had feelings for each other and were still shown as basically meant to be (mostly because as someone who has shipped those two forever and will continue to do so, it was great to see it confirmed for all the people that still deny that pairing).6. I can imagine the stage play being at least visually amazing. The sets that were described, I could picture and I felt like it would be great to watch. (Although, I still don't understand why they sell the tickets for part 1 and 2 separately. I mean, I do understand because they want more money even thought the tickets are ridiculously expensive as it is but expecting people to pay twice so that they get the whole story is absurd) Things I disliked (hold onto your sorting hats because this is where I release the fantastic beast):1. Albus Potter and Rose Weasley. Albus came across as a bit of a brat to me, there was nothing very appealing about him, and nothing about him drew me in and made me feel very much for him. Rose was rude and snobby. I refuse to believe that Hermione and Ron would raise someone like her. Hermione was fairly rude and snobby at the start of the first book, but she changed and developed and grew out of it. By the end of the books she was basically the opposite to how she was in the first book with the exception of still being incredibly intelligent. Her child would not be raised to be like that. Ron would not raise a child who was that far up her own ass.2. The characterisation of the main trio. There is no way in hell that Harry would be a bad Dad. That was not Harry Potter. I don't know who that was. Harry who was raised by a family that hated him, that searched for and yearned for loving fatherly figures. Who basically had four loving fatherly figures in the shape of Hagrid, Arthur Weasley, Sirius Black, and Remus Lupin who he could watch and learn from. After all of that he would not treat any of his children that poorly. He would not tell his son 'it's fine if you get into Slytherin because there are still great people that have come from that house' and then when his son gets sorted into Slytherin be disappointed and pissed off about it and fail to hide it from him. Harry Potter would never speak that way to McGonagall. Never! I am expected to believe that he would talk to the woman who he has so much respect for that he stepped in front of a wand and cursed someone that dared to spit at her in such a disrespectful, rude, and nasty way? Hell no. Hermione Granger was so bland. Where was her fiery attitude, where was her stubbornness, where was her passion, most importantly where was her intelligence?? Hermione is too intelligent to have thought hiding a time turner in her bookcase was a great place to hide it. She is too clever to not have better protection at the ministry and for her office, especially considering that she broke into the ministry herself before and should know to use some sort of spell to stop people who are using polyjuice potion to come in. She is too passionate and caring to allow her child to be mean and rude towards other people that she views as less than. Hermione is too fiery to be unable to keep people's attention at a meeting she has called. Ron Weasley was basically movie Ron as opposed to book Ron. Movie Ron was always just a shell of the character he is in the books. Apart from the perfect casting, the writers of the movies stripped away his great moments and positive personality traits and they either gave his great moments to Hermione or they just disregarded them entirely. They made him the joke of the trio. The one who didn't really do much to help and just cracked a joke all the time. That was how they wrote him in this play as well. Ron has so much depth to his character and the movies and this play erased all of that.3. I'm always a sucker for time travel stories and stories about people going back and changing something and then coming back to see everything different. The butterfly effect (phoenix effect or hippogriff effect, in this case maybe?) is a plot that I am always on board with. However, it has to be done right and in this case, I had a lot of issues with it. There was no real logic or consistency with it and with how it worked. It was all over the place.4. The plot holes. In general, I find it quite easy to look past certain plot holes, especially when necessary but in this case they were all so glaringly obvious that it was hard to see past them. In what logical way was going to the first task to mess up Cedric a good place to start in the plan? In what logical way was going to the second task to mess him up a good plan when the first one, unsurprisingly, didn't work? Neither of those made sense. How well the contestants of the Triwizard Tournament did in the first two tasks had no real bearing on whether or not they would be able to get the cup in the last task. Him being tied with Harry meant that he could enter the maze first at the same time with him but after that they were separated and just managed to find each other again to grab the cup at the same time. Even if Cedric had entered the maze after Harry, there's no reason why he couldn't have beaten him to the cup or made it there at the same time again anyway. Not to mention the fact that Cedric came second in the first task anyway so sabotaging him in that one was unnecessary. Also, the plan was to embarrass him to the point where he'd drop out? That is a terrible plan to risk traveling back in time for. Delphi being Voldemort's daughter makes zero sense. If she had been introduced in the original books and had been conceived when Voldemort was first in power, maybe I could be on board with it but trying to claim the Bellatrix had her at Malfoy Manor just before the Battle of Hogwarts is absolute BS. Bellatrix wasn't pregnant, and showed no signs of either being pregnant or just having a baby, either when the trio ended up there or when she was at the battle of Hogwarts. If she had just had a baby before either of those then she deserved a damn medal. Plus, Draco would've known about it! She was his aunt and Voldemort and Bellatrix were staying at Malfoy Manor. Draco was there. He would've known that she was pregnant. He would've known that it was Voldemort's. His parents would've definitely known about it and they weren't ones for keeping things from Draco. The whole thing just doesn't work.5. Cedric Diggory. I'm expected to believe that it's possible that Cedric could/would become so embarrassed that he would turn to dark magic and become a death eater? Cedric Diggory?! The boy who believed in fair play and justice and doing the right thing every single time, no matter what. The boy who won a Quidditch match by default and refused to accept it and called for a redo because it was unfair. The boy who told Harry how to figure out the second task because Harry had let him know about the first one. The boy who refused to take the cup because he didn't think it was fair and felt that Harry deserved it for saving his life. The boy who was kind and good and true. You expect me to believe that there is anyway in any universe or any timeline that he could possibly become a death eater? Witch, please! GTFO! You don't deserve to even utter Cedric's name. He was a damn Hufflepuff for crying out loud!6. Albus and Scorpius were clearly gay or at least bi. It was made blatantly obvious throughout that they had feelings for each other that went well past friendship and yet they both fancied girls and Scorpius for some reason was really into Rose despite how horrible she was. I'm not even one that usually picks up on things like this or complains about them but this was so blatant and it was so obvious that I can't believe (although, sadly, I think I actually can) that they refused to acknowledge it.Overall, the book was OK. I was disappointed with a lot of it and I don't accept it (or at least most of it) as canon but, as a separate story which I consider as a fan fiction, it is a decent story that's fairly fun and entertaining."},

I wanted to love this...I love Harry Potter and everything about the Harry Potter world. I wanted to immerse myself in 320 pages of old friends and new friends and walk away with the warm fuzzy feelings of nostalgia and joy. Instead, I put the book down as I finished it and just thought \"eh.\" 1) The plot -- weak beyond weak. 'Going back in time causes changes in the present' is one of the oldest 'what ifs' in history, and authors have used it beautifully to explore possibilities. Unfortunately, this book used the \"what if\" as a cheesy excuse to stick scenes from past books in almost word for word. Not only that, but the \"effects\" of the \"changes\" were weak and not substantiated by the cannon of Harry Potter. (view spoiler)[ So many problems with this story line -- lets start with the most basic -- we are supposed to believe that Harry Potter's child doesn't realize that going back in time can change the future?The writers don't even give the audience enough respect to make up some kind of explanation behind why Albus thinks HIS change to history isn't going to have any effect aside from an offhanded \"oh, Cedric was the spare\" comment. Weak. But the plot holes keep growing: Cedric Diggory gets embarrassed and turns into a Death Eater? Ummm....no. Not the Cedric from the book who stays on Potter's side even after he DIES! How about Snape who buys that Scorpius is from an alternate reality with just a 3 minute talk? Not the Snape we know and love! So many more...  (hide spoiler)]2) The characters -- see the above...if you're a Harry Potter superfan you know these characters like your own best friends - but even if all you've done is read the books, you still have clear expectations of characters. Rowling's series is YA literature, and despite the classes that have tried to read depth into them, the characters are unarguably clear. Having those characters change dramatically in a story with no catalyst besides \"getting older\" or \"thinking\" is a huge plot weakness. (view spoiler)[ Harry telling his son he wishes he wasn't his father? No way. This is the child who grew up WITHOUT a father, he KNOWS the power of a father. Ron and Hermione become side notes and almost caricatures of themselves. We've all loved Ron's lovable oafishness for years, but this book takes it to the extreme - he's a bumbling fool, and a total joke. Even Hermione -- who was always the brains of the operation -- is stupid enough to store the time turner in her own library with such a weak protection on it that Albus and Scorpius are able to break in and find it? While we're at it - lets talk about that break in scene -- the painful \"Albus as Ron\" moments making a joke of Ron and Hermione, but then it never comes back up? No discussion of \"I want to have another baby or a vacation\" disappearing from Ron's memory? And I haven't even gotten to DRACO becoming warm fuzzy??? \"We can hug too if you want...\" ummm...WHAT? Now don't get me wrong - I am one of the few people who actually LIKED Draco. I like the constant struggle he showed between his natural inclination to be evil, his desire to please his father, and his intrinsic tug of goodness. He has moments, and those moments are beautiful...but he is not going to be Harry POtter's new BFF just because they bonded over \"gosh it was lonely growing up.\" WHAT IS THIS?? AN AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL???  (hide spoiler)]3) The writing....this is the death knell in my eyes. It doesn't ring with JK Rowling's language. Reading this is basically like reading a cliff notes version of a weak fan fiction piece. The language, the voice, the diction -- all of it basic and weak. Don't try to tell me it's because it's a play.....I read plays fairly frequently, and depth and beauty of language is even more important on stage -- see Tennessee Williams, or even Miranda's recent Hamilton. This just feels rushed and forced. I'm sure great actors could make it feel better - but as a pure script it fails. (view spoiler)[ No real spoilers here -- the writing is just WEAK. In the words of one of my friends, it's \"all sizzle no steak..\" only the sizzle is pretty dang weak too.  (hide spoiler)]Overall, my final review is that this feels like a very weak attempt to keep the Harry Potter money train moving forward. I hate to say anything against Rowling, but this is clearly NOT her work...and why she would put her name on it is beyond me unless she just wants the money. My suggestion -- check it out from the library, don't waste your money.

I read this because my partner pre-ordered it and so I thought I'd give it a go.Straight away I was disappointed. Though the original story may have been thought up by J. K. Rowling, I felt as though this was horrendously written fan-fiction. The characters didn't feel like those that I grew up with. Despite the trio playing a huge part in this story, none of them felt like the writers knew them at all; they were pale shells of themselves, playing off the main character traits that almost made them seem ridiculous. I'm not going to go into the plot holes, the bad characterisation or the disappointing writing any further because I don't want to get into spoilers. Overall I would say to skip this one. I think seeing this performed would definitely be a better experience, though I'm not sure how they could ever fix all of the issues I have based on this script. There were several points in this book where I actually laughed out loud at things that happened, not because they were funny, almost because they made me feel sad. This isn't part of the canon to me, despite what J. K. Rowling has said. Honestly, it feels as though it was written by somebody who has only ever watched the films, has never read the books, and wanted a stage production/book that they knew would sell. Highly disappointing."},

Okay, calling the long-awaited Harry Potter play lame is a bit harsh, but while this is a HP-book, I won't call it a really good one. Not everything J.K. Rowling writes becomes pure gold.  So as a Harry Potter fan and a scriptwriter, I'm going to explain why the script kicks ass as a play, but sucks as a story. I love theater: I'm an actress and I have even written theater scripts and movie scenario's myself, so I know what things work and don't work on a stage. And with that knowledge I can say that this play would be awesome to watch. Because can you imagine? Seeing these things live:- The beginning at King's Cross? The place where it all started/ended? I'd probably burst into tears seeing that live. - The effects of polyjuice potion? - Time travelling with a Time Turner?- Part Two, Act Three?! Because that part was the best of the whole book and seeing that on stage would blow me away (especially the finale. Holy crap, reading that part alone gave me goosebumps). - The last battle between You-Know-Who (HA!) and Harry?- And of course, seeing Albus and Scorpius, the only good characters in this play, interact live. Okay, Albus is first a bit of a pretentious whiner, but when Scorpius puts his life into perspective Albus sobers up and becomes just as strong as Scorpius. Ugh, precious boys. u0026lt;3But apart from the visual effects, the story of the play - which in itself is pretty bad, but I'll get to that - would actually work very well on stage. The dramatic actions, the conflicts between fathers and sons, the battles: those make a play interesting to watch. To simply read a script makes any story seem unrealistic, but you won't notice that when you're watching the play. Than the story 'works his magic'.So yes, this play would be marvelous to watch, and reading all the positive reviews, it certainly is. I hope I'll get the chance to see it someday.But as great as the script works out live, it is a script based on the Harry Potter universe. That universe is famous and known by millions of people, and that's why you have to be careful with writing a HP-play. It has to be a good, well-researched story.And that's what wrong with this book/script: the story isn't researched at all. In fact, it is awful. I've read people compare it to fanfiction, and I'm not even going to do that. Because fanfiction-writers do their research. Because even the most horrifying Harry Potter fanfiction of all (My Immortal) isn't as bad as this one. \"My Immortal\" is at least so bad that it becomes hilarious. It's a clear parody of the original Harry Potter books and so the story only makes me laugh.  The story of The Cursed Child however often made me want to tear my hair out and cry. Many other Goodreaders made great lists of reasons why the Cursed Child sucks, and I really agree with those. The Time-Travelling was very plot-convenient, of the Golden Trio Ron's character was butchered most of all, and Albus u0026amp; Scorpius's relationship feels a lot like queerbaiting. Still, I want to mention the bad parts of the CC which pissed me off the most, so here's a top three:3.) Rose, the daughter of Ron and Hermoine, being mean and prejudiced to Scorpius. Rose, the daughter of Hermoine. You know, the girl who got bullied almost the whole time while she was at Hogwarts. Hermoine, who knows the negative-effects of prejudice better than anyone. That Hermoine, letting her own daughter act the same way as her old bullies? NO WAY IN HELL. 2.) What Jack Thorne, the writer of this play, did to Cedric Diggory. That boy already got an end he didn't deserve, and even now he can't rest in piece. Leave Cedric alone. 1.) Harry being an horrible father. Harry has multiple father-figures in the books, and while not all of them are good and healthy ones, they all support and care for him. Mr. Weasley, Dumbledore, Sirius, Remus, and especially Hagrid are there to help and talk to Harry when he needs to. Also, take in account that Harry himself has been abused and yelled at for the first eleven years of his life, so reading about Harry yelling at his child and telling Albus that he wishes he wasn't his son? No. No, Jack Thorne. That's not my Harry.And so, although it saddens my Harry Potter Heart, I'll give this book/script 3 stars. This play has a kind of magical power and energy to it that would make it incredible to watch on stage, but the story of the play alone is horrible and damaging to its original characters. Albus and Scorpius are sweet boys and awesome Slytherins, but even they aren't strong enough to save Cedric, Harry's parents, or this play. Ps. If you do want to watch a Harry Potter-play that is more true to the characters, and totally awesome, I suggest A Very Potter Musical. The actors all have fun, the songs are great, and you can watch it for free on Youtube. A good remedy for the sour taste that CC gave us."},

I'm dialogue driven person. Sometimes I skip few paragraphs just to read what a characters has to say. It's not called skipping, it's technique to read faster. As this book was written in stage play I absolutely have no problems with it. 2. Harry becomes obnoxious? No people he doesn't or may be he does. People grow into something different than you imagined they would. Being parent is not an easy job. It happens, so that being said I have no problems with Harry's character development or any other (Ron/Hermione) for that matter. 3. For me, Albus never took the back-seat. He was hero for me for the entire novel, no Scorpio doesn't steal the limelight. Well, not for me atleast. I liked him, no doubt but this story is of Albus Potter, no one else. I can go on and on about things that worked for me.Then why 1 star - refer to below sectionParts didn't work out for me: Time travelling. It is as easy and simple people. I hate time travelling - it is mentioned in my profile as well. Time travelling/Parallel universe, that type of stuff makes me antsy. Very uneasy and nervous. Hence my capacity of reading/rating."},

What doesn't feel amazing is that my thoughts are so conflicted. I finished reading this play and immediately stamped 5/5 on my Goodreads review. It wasn't that I loved the story, it was that I loved being transported back to a world I love, to characters I adore so much and to experience that magic once again. I had tears in my eyes whilst finishing this book because it just brought back all those nostalgic feelings. The problem was that the story wasn't as good as I had hoped and the more I think about the book, the less happy with it I get. It's currently on a 3/5 with the potential to go lower if I dwell on it anymore. So, no more dwelling, time for reviewing. And, don't worry, if you haven't read the book yet then I won't spoil it. I will keep this part completely non-spoilery and then have the spoilers after a massive warning, for all those who have read it.This was never going to be the story that most Harry Potter fans wanted. For one thing, it is a script of a play and not a novel. We all knew this before buying so it's not a shock, but it does mean it's a weird new way to experience the Harry Potter world. This is something that is supposed to be experienced and watched, not read. The other main issue is that, no matter how largely they write her name on the cover, this was not written by J.K. Rowling. And that is a terrible thing to me as it meant that I felt the characters were just lacking in a way they wouldn't have been if she had wrote it. The characters always just felt a little off and not like the characters we spent seven books getting to know.                    How Jack Thorne u0026amp; JKR are probably feeling    The story itself was not at all what I was expecting, but I am mentioning nothing about it here. I think it is better to go in blind. We all know this book takes place 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, and follows Harry's son Albus rather than Harry. We meet some brilliant characters in this, but also some bad ones. My main issue with the story was that it all felt a bit ridiculous and that a lot of it didn't make sense. I, quite honestly, can never view this play as canon because it all just feels ridiculous and as if it would never happen. Another major issue is the gaping plot holes that this book then leaves us with. And I hate gaping plot holes!So, yes, overall I was disappointed. I loved some aspects of this but was really pissed about others. I need to go into spoilery detail to explain all that.  If you haven't read this yet or seen the play then now is the time to skip out.      !SPOILERS AHEAD!    Okay, now we have got the warning out of the way... LET'S DO THIS!!!(view spoiler)[I am actually excited to review this and go into all my spoilery thoughts. I have to, I won't be able to contain myself otherwise. I need to lay it all out on the table. First I need to get this out of the way: I LOVE HARRY POTTER! If you know me in real life or from my blog, twitter or instagram then you already know this. Harry Potter is my life and has been since I was 6/7 and my nan bought me the first book. Harry Potter was basically my childhood and I loved every minute of it. It was a childhood of midnight releases of books and films. Of dressing up as a Hogwarts student for Halloween. It's owning more HP clothes than regular clothes. It's having to do the Harry Potter London walking tour and Studio Tour. It's owning multiple editions of the books. Harry Potter is life and will forever be. BUT I am never going to be one of those people who is blinded by my love for something. I wanted to love this play, I really did, but I didn't in the end and that is because it has a lot of flaws and problems and things I didn't like. Plus, and I feel this is important, it is a script for a play and I feel it is better to experience as a show (which I will doing next year as I got tickets!!!).I will do a very quick summary for anyone reading the spoilery side even if they haven't read the play (naughty!). Basically the story focuses on Harry's son Albus as he begins attending Hogwarts and gets placed in Slytherin *gasp*. This is a huge deal and Albus ends up sucking at magic and forever living in his fathers shadow, which he resents, and their relationship is basically strained as fuck. Harry is a terrible father for some reason. Scorpius Malfoy is the most adorable bean of all time and him and Albus become best friends, who are totally in love with each other (but we will get to that later). Amos Diggory shows up out the blue with his niece Delphi, wanting Harry to go back in time and save Cedric's life. Harry, even though one last surviving time turner has been found, lies and says he can't. Albus then decides to do it himself, with the help of good ol' Scorpius. Of course going back in time and changing one tiny detail changes everything and shit hits the fan. So then they keep having to go back, changing things until eventually we figure out that Delphi is the lovechild of Voldemort and Bellatrix and she wants to go back in time to prevent him from ever killing Harry, so that he would never have been defeated. And, yeah, there is one really simplified version of this messy plot.Trying to make sense of The Cursed Child plot, like...The first thing I have to mention is probably what anyone who has read it wanted to discuss the most... Voldemort had a lovechild with Bellatrix Lestrange! REALLY!?!?! I got to that point in the book and suddenly understood why I had heard people saying they felt this read like fan fiction. My mouth dropped open and disappointment set in. It just makes zero sense to me, and the explanation of it and timeline of those events also make no sense to me. I just don't see Voldemort as someone concerned with having a child. His plan was to get the Deathly Hallows and master death, so he wasn't looking for an heir. And, come on, it's not like the guy has even one tiny paternal bone in his body. The only thing that does make sense is that if Voldemort had a kid with anyone it would be Bellatrix, you can totally see her wanting to have his baby. I still don't get how this all happened and no one knew. And that it was never alluded to in the final book. She apparently gave birth in the Malfor Manor before the Battle of Hogwarts. So where was the baby whilst she was off fighting? Why did Draco not know about it? Or did he and just never felt like he should mention it?!? Come on, this is the most ridiculous HP storyline in the history of ever and I am going to pretend that it is fanfiction and not canon because otherwise I'd have to rate this a 1/5 and I just can't deal with that right now!The next thing we have to discuss is the main plot device here: time travel. Why?!?! Do not mess with time travel, it's far too overused and just results in endless plot holes and problems. This book is not an exception to that rule. Especially when we take into account that the main plot here is that Albus and Scorpius want to use the time turner to go back in time and save Cedric Diggory's life...They have a time turner that can take them back years and they are going to use this to save Cedric Diggory. Can we all take a moment to appreciate how utterly pointless and stupid that act would be if we think about the fact they could go back in time and strangle tiny, evil baby Voldemort and save thousands of people?!? Oh no, let's just go back in time and save one boy.That is like someone giving you a time turner in our world and going back in time to save Anne Frank, rather than killing Hitler. If you kill the evil overlord then you would save all the people that died at their hands. So the whole time I am just sitting here wanting to slap everyone for being so stupid. But it is obvious why they can't all suddenly realise they have the power to murder Voldemort and prevent everything... It would mean that everything that came after that would completely change and the first seven Harry Potter books would never have happened. So of course we can't have that, so we will just have this giant stupid plot hole instead. Gah, I hate the time travel storyline so much.The next biggest problem with this book is the characterisation and how wrong it is in this play. Ron is suddenly reduced to just a little bit of comedic relief. He just eats food and pulls pranks, and apparently got so drunk at his wedding that he forgot most of it. Why has Ron suddenly turned into a Weasley twin too? I know he liked pranks and found them funny before, but he was no Fred or George. And why is he giving a small boy a love potion as a joke gift? He was put under the influence of a love potion and it wasn't an experience he particularly enjoyed, so I can't see him then being stupid enough to give one to a child. Ron is my fictional husband and I hated seeing what Jack Thorne reduced his character to here, it was not fun to read.Harry was even worse, I hated him being the world's worst father who would be so horrible to tell his son that sometimes he wished he wasn't his son. I just don't see Harry ever saying that. I feel he would love his children, no matter how difficult they could be and appreciate being able to be their for them, as he never had that as a child. And watching him treat Professor McGonagall like shit made for even more unpleasant reading. Am I supposed to believe that Harry, the guy who flipped out when a Death Eater spat on her, would then go and treat her with so little respect? Nope, I am not buying that.Hermione was just as hard to read, especially in the timeline where her and Ron never got together. She basically becomes a female version of Snape. She's Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts, who treats the children horribly. She's nasty and bitter, and apparently all because she didn't wind up with Ron?!? No. Are we really reducing Hermione down to this? She is a strong, brave, kind person and I don't see her ever turning that bitter because of a guy, she is so much better than that. Why did J.K. Rowling give this her stamp of approval?!?!Me watching Jack Thorne ruin my favourite charactersAnd I am still not sold on the fact that getting humiliated one time would suddenly turn Cedric Diggory into an evil Death Eater?!? Come on. I know this is J.K. Rowling trying some Butterfly Effect type situation but it is just awful. I don't believe for one second that Cedric would allow that one moment in his life change him so completely that he suddenly goes to the HP Dark Side and start working for Voldemort. No.I have another big issue and that is this: Scorpius and Albus are blatantly in love with each other. The issue isn't that they love each other, the issue is that this seems super obvious to 90% of people reading and yet it is never addressed. Instead they end the book with them discussing what girls they want to get with. Come on, they totally love each other and I ship it endlessly. I just get so sad to see the potential to have our first openly gay couple in the Harry Potter universe squandered. These two were just utterly adorable and I ship it endlessly and feel it is time we finally have a gay couple in HP. Not just watch them fill a play with so much homoerotic subtext and then just brush it all aside at the end. No. In my mind they become the most adorably squishy couple ever, get married and join the Potter and Malfoy households. It wasn't all bad though and there were aspects that I really liked. The biggest one being Scorpius Malfoy! He is adorable and I just loved his character. He is so sweet and kind, and I just was so happy with his character. I also loved that Albus and Scorpius were both Slytherins, and both kind, wonderful Slytherins. I have a big soft spot for Slytherin house so I was happy that this play shows that Slytherins are just as awesome! I also loved Scorpius and Albus together, but still wholeheartedly believe they should be a couple. The thing I loved most about this was all the Hermione and Ron feelings that it gave me. I was so happy when reading this book. I loved when Rob told Hermione he wanted to renew their wedding vows, it was utterly adorable. And I cried a little when, even in the world where they never got together, they both still loved each other and sacrificed themselves together! My shipper heart could not handle that! (hide spoiler)]                  3/5 Butterflies        Writing this review actually felt quite therapeutic, but I must admit that the more I think about the story, the more upset I get. I just wanted this to be amazing and everything I was hoping for, and it wasn't. I feel this was definitely missing J.K. Rowling's touch and I wish she had been the one to write the script, as I feel the characters would have felt more real if she had. It wasn't all bad and I enjoyed the story whilst reading. It blew my mind reading it, as I tried to figure out how they were going to pull this off on stage. I am excited to see it on stage, as I feel I will love it when I see that. But I can't ever consider this as canon because it just had too many plot holes and makes little sense when you think back on the Harry Potter books.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[I am actually excited to review this and go into all my spoilery thoughts.

Rowling. However, I wanted to give it the benefit of the doubt. The story had her consent, so it could not be that bad, right? It was bad. How so many people seem to like it I will never know. My disdain for the story roots from the horrendous treatment characters got, not only because their lives were not what I expected/assumed they would be, but because characters we have been shown with characteristics and certain feelings, got those traits completely erased in order to fit the narrative of the story, which is not that appealing in the first place.Before I go on a non-spoiler rampage of all I despised with this \u201cplay\u201d, I want to mention that quite a few things were not bad, but quite agreeable. Albus and Scorpious are both in Slytherin. I knew it was going to happen, one could simply tell, but it is nice to finally have two \u201cmain characters\u201d in the house that once (and apparently still) was considered evil. As no one wanted to focus on Merlin, Slughorn, Regulus, Andromeda, and probably a bunch of other characters that were named but never given any characteristics. Which always leads me to this question: CAN SLYHTERINS JUST GET A BREAK???!!!That aside, some of the dialogue by Draco Malfoy, as well as some of his conversations with the Golden Trio seemed quite accurate, yes, even that acclaimed exclamation all over Tumblr about him loving being bossed around by Hermione Granger. My favourite scene was one in which Draco is distraught by a \u201cplot-twist\u201d, as his son and Albus are \u201cmissing\u201d. \u201cDRACO: I don\u2019t care what you did or who you saved, you are a constant curse on my family, Harry Potter.\u201d It tells the perfect relationship the Potter and Malfoy families seem to have here, and it seems to trod along with the belief of a few people as well, no matter how good Harry was (and he was/is), many people gave their lives for him, and that is a curse, even though it helped the Wizarding World. There is also a small snippet of what it ight be like to be Draco: \u201cIt is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. I will always be suspected. There is no escaping the past.\u201d No matter how much one might run, the past will always catch up with them, yet, it does not have to be the end. And finally, we have the fun scenes that demonstrate the wittiness that Draco possesses:\u201cDraco: Flipendo! \u2026 Keep up, old man.Harry: We\u2019re the same age, Draco.Draco: I wear it better.\u201dThe one other thing was how Ron and Hermione\u2019s love transpired everything. It showed that no matter in which world, they were meant for each other.That is all I enjoyed. Now, onto the things I disliked.Characters that were done a disservice, since their essence was butchered: Hermione, McGonagall, Harry, Ron, Astoria, Draco, Scorpious, Albus, Rose, Bellatrix, Voldemort, and perhaps a couple more. Yes, even Bellatrix and Voldemort. I will only go into detail for a couple, and at the end of the review I will go into the spoiler-filled destroyed characters.Let us begin with the most obvious one, Hermione Jean Granger. Do we all remember S.P.E.W.? How this little, almost non-existent organization, showed Hermione as a person who valued everyone\u2019s lives as equal, whether they were lowly elves, giants, werewolves, centaurs. But for some reason, the protector of magical creatures has not found a way to at least, keep the peace between them and humans. No, she seems rather incompetent when it comes to that, particularly when we are given her position in the government. Also, her logic is severely flawed here, in almost all aspects. Then we get one of the biggest disappointments, Rose Granger-Weasley. The daughter of two brave and good-hearted people, who value family and friendship above everything, abandons her cousin simply because he belongs to another house. Rose gave me the impression that she was a version of Pansy, someone I would hate to be in school with. We all know that in this version of events, Scorpious and Albus are bullied for who they are, and Rose does nothing to stop this, perhaps she does not even tell her parents of what is going on. To this day, I imagine Rose as a clever girl with a kind-heart, someone that loves her family, and who fights for her friends, like her father, who stood in front of Harry so he would not be hurt. Like her mother, who never gave anything away, even under the Cruciatus curse. Here she seems to be following popularity, even at the cost of her loved ones. That is not the daughter the two wonderful heroes would raise. \u201cHow to distract Scorpius from difficult emotional issues. Take him to a library.\u201d The one accurate thing that I imagined would ever be authentic about the son of Malfoy in this book. Scorpious and Albus\u2019 life is a disaster, simply because of the house they belong to, as I seriously doubt it has anything to do with their families. Status is not something that is simply lost after certain events, it is a way of thinking and living, and no matter how much many try to change it, it requires time. Therefore, I will never believe that a Malfoy would loose the status that they have had for centuries, considering that they did not loose it after the first war, and that Narcissa basically saved Harry from death. It made no sense, particularly after they were pardoned and married a non-purist pureblood family. Also, a Potter being mistreated because he is in Slytherin? Even after Slytherins themselves fought at the Battle of Hogwarts? Even though he has done nothing to deserve dislike except for his horrendous name? No. The second greatest fall of this work is the plot, as it was mostly, useless. Of all the things to bring to the story, the one they went with is the one that leaves everything with nothing that should be touched upon again. I expected better, I wish I had gotten it. When I have children, I will give them the seven Harry Potter books, and when they are done and ask for more, I will gladly tell them to go read fanfiction, and I will never mention this book exists. I do not have time for some of my favourite, and the most iconic characters ever, to be obliterated before their eyes. I am not that cruel._____________________________Emiy Cait's Spoiler Video gets a lot of the same points: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRYIY..."},

This play/book, is mature than the seven novels, a play that is magical but is still less magical than the books and a lot of focus on characters! Furthermore, this book didn't loose its funny side with both Scorpius and Ron being the comic relief. I won't say much more about this play without spoiling it!

Mainly Act 3 and 4 - maybe it'll be a good pace while it's being performed?To continue, there are still many issues I have with the plot. Delphi, for instance. Why Lily Luna was sidelined so much. Why so many characters were left out - all the Weasleys (i.e. Roxanne, Dominique, Victoire, Fred II, Molly II), Lorcan and Lysander...(view spoiler)[ Snape being referred to as \"every inch a hero\"DRACO looks up at HARRY, and for the first time\u2014 at the bottom of this dreadful pit\u2014they look at each other as friends.Me: *starts crying* You don't know what he needs.

(hide spoiler)]And the thing that makes me the most annoyed: how much JKR could've done with the sexualities of these brand new characters, but chose not to. I'm sorry?? How hard would it have been to make Scorbus gay? Come on. They literally make the book what it is. They shine together more than they do without. Scorpius Malfoy will undoubtedly steal your heart. Albus and Harry, of course, i think are the main characters, but he is someone who stands out even in the words he says in this script. He is wonderful, beautiful, thoughtful, and everything beyond my expectations. He makes me want to fight to be a better person. Albus is very angsty (he's Harry's son through and through!)All the Ron and Hermione scenes made my heart warm. I honestly don't care if Dramione shippers point out that Hermione calls him Draco etc etc, whatever, you have your ship and I have the two people who can't stop being in love in every alternative universe. Everyone was really OOC in a lot of the play, though. (*cough* Snape *cough*) Especially Harry, which sucks. Also, so many lines were repeated from the books - that was surprising. In a way, a lot of this was like bad fanfiction.If this was a novel, it would be much thicker and much more developed all around, I think. Maybe because we tend to read faster in these one lines, but it was like...one minute they were at Hogwarts and then it was like 3 years later. During the play it would've probably taken some time to get everything changed, but we - as a reader - don't get that.Even though it is a scriptbook, it felt like J.K. Rowling's writing.

I guess I should expect that since this story is a lot shorter and lacked the detail that we got from Rowling's previous books. But the one thing that really disappointed me was the lack of HEART this book had. Despite knowing so much about this world, this story didn't hit me as much as the other ones did.Should I consider this canon? Not really. There were some parts that could be and others that shouldn't. Would I recommend this book to all HP fans? Sure. If you're a die hard fan then go for it. Feed your curiosity. But if you don't read it, it's not a big deal. You're not really missing much. The first 7 books are the ones you should read in your lifetime. This book is more of a bonus.I hope that one day, Rowling will rewrite this story again and publish it as a full-on novel. I am sure there is more to this story than what I have read. I'd like to see her expand this story even more and see what the rest of the Potterworld has been up to while all this is happening. Kinda like a \"Writer's Cut\" edition, if you get my drift. Maybe that can be the official 8th book in the series. Until then, there are only 7 books to the story for me."},

Maybe because they're so much older... But a lot of them felt far off from their younger counter-parts (although I've changed exponentially since I was 17 so... Fair enough) but I hated that Ron came off the way he did. He was such a lump and a putz with little personality and essentially was Hermione's lesser half. Hermione was a stronger personality, as she usually is, but I feel like she lost a lot of her logic and wisdom... How do you LOSE wisdom over the years? Harry was always a bit all over the place for me so that was about the same and Ginny was a total movie Ginny, not book Ginny. Ugh. There was a weird sexual tension between the Albus and Scorpius (was that just me? Them always commenting on the hugging thing?) and I honestly thought it was going to be revealed that one had a crush on the other, which would have been fine expect for the fact that it didn't and I was confused by them always bringing up hugging and the deep friendship feelings which sounded almost romantic. Maybe I was reading too much into that because I was looking for more depth! There were also a few characters from the series who make appearances (though I won't reveal who they were) and some were AWESOME and some were confusing, to say the least. Honestly, some of it was so much fun. Parts made me cry. Some made me laugh. But I also had moments where I scratched my head, questioned a lot, and even laughed out loud (not in a good way). Some of it was suuuuper cheesy and I can see why people said it read as fanfic. I think the fact that it was a rehearsal copy of a script really had a part in that too. You lose so much when you're not READING reactions, nuances, and tone of voice. Some of that is included but the atmosphere is greatly lost because of the format. So much is shown through the scenery and the acting (I imagine) that is not needed to include in a script, and I'm sure there are so many notes that aren't included to keep the book from being endless amounts of scenery and character notes. The overall plot was... a really interesting concept but seemingly poorly executed. This was like cramming multiple books into one book (or I suppose, one play) and concepts were sort of flying all over the place. It was really fun to see things from the original series turn up but other times, the references back to the original series was very cheesy or just plain inaccurate. (Small inaccuracies, in my opinion but it's Harry freakin' Potter. You don't think the fandom will pick up on this, you guys??) I mean, obviously this was specifically adapted for a play and that's how they wanted to tell this story... But I really, really wish it had been developed into an actual book instead of just giving us the rehearsal script. There was so much more of this story to tell! Things would have been a lot less cheesy if they had been developed or explained. (Although some things I'll never get over. They were just weird.) Everything felt really, really rushed and I would have rather had a simpler plot with more development instead of bursting from scene to scene. There was no time to really absorb anything and that also left very little room for character development. I don't care if we already know the majority of these characters -- they still need to have a personality. So great to see the future for Harry Potter but I just really feel a little let down by a short story. Overall, it felt messy and rushed and after sleeping on it, I think I'm left more disappointed than excited about the development. I would have loved to see this really developed in a novel or in a series. We needed so much more time with Albus to understand him a little better. I would have loved to see this great friendship between the two boys and their complicated friendship with Rose (oh, and don't get me started about her role in the end of the book. An even cheesier way to wrap things up. Yay). I always love more time at Hogwarts. I would have loved to see those little clues along the way to the big reveal. I was okay with what the plot WAS but it really just needed way more development. I kind of feel like if it can't be done well, best to leave it alone. I guess beggars can't be choosers! Now can we have an Ilvermorny series pretty please? Full and organized review as originally posted HERE on The Book Addict's Guide 8/16/16: Obviously there are a lot of mixed emotions before starting the infamous eighth Harry Potter book. Naturally I was excited \u2014 because it\u2019s Harry freakin\u2019 Potter \u2014 but I also just didn\u2019t quite feel as excited as I thought I should be. Before picking up the bound version of the play (since I guess we really shouldn\u2019t be calling it a book as it was never intended to be an actual book), I knew there were a few things that were hindering my excitement that I ultimately expected to affect my overall enjoyment of the experience (and in fact, they all did play a part in that). I knew that J.K. Rowling was involved in the plot and creation of CURSED CHILD, but ultimately, it was not her writing on the page. I knew that I was going to be reading a rehearsal script for the play and that the formatting might throw off my experience. And I knew that I\u2019d be reading about adult Harry, Ron, Hermione, and company and I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d like where their characters were in their adult lives since we had some pretty cheesy things happen in the epilogue of DEATHLY HALLOWS, and that actually was J.K. Rowling\u2019s writing.The short version of this review is that CURSED CHILD was kind of all over the place for me. The overall plot was interesting and I really, really loved certain parts but other parts of it just seemed so\u2026 I guess amateur is the best word I can think of at the moment, although that seems quite harsh. We\u2019ve grown to love J.K. Rowling\u2019s stories and how detailed they are and there were just certain things about CURSED CHILD that didn\u2019t seem like they were plotted out very well. Other parts seemed completely random and totally uncharacteristic of the series. The overall concept of this story of the next generation was a really interesting concept but seemingly poorly executed. This was like cramming multiple books into one book (or I suppose, one play) and concepts were sort of flying all over the place. It was really fun to see things from the original series turn up but other times, the references back to the original series was very cheesy or just plain inaccurate. Small inaccuracies in some parts (it was \u201cHappee Birthdae\u201d not \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d), and some big timeline disagreements in others but it\u2019s Harry freakin\u2019 Potter. You don\u2019t think the fandom will pick up on these? (They totally did.) It was just things like that that really made me feel like this was sloppily put together and that these playwrights who put the CURSED CHILD play together were missing some really core feelings and elements of the series.I knew that I was going to be reading a script when I started and it was definitely a unique experience but I think the format lost a LOT in translation. There was less atmosphere, less dialogue, and less development which obviously you\u2019ll get through the actors of the play and you won\u2019t see in a rehearsal script. I just felt like I lost so much not READING those reactions, nuances, tone of voice, sensory descriptions \u2014 I mean, really a little of everything that brings the world of Harry Potter to life. Some of that is included in the script notes but the atmosphere is greatly lost because of the format.

Harry was always a bit all over the place for me so that was about the same and Ginny was a total movie Ginny, not book Ginny. (Ugh.) The main adult characters (the aforementioned) seemed so stiff and one-dimensional which is hard to bear after spending a full series with them, reading the series multiple times, and watching the movies over and over. We know these characters. They are our childhood. They are our friends. We grew up with them. To see them underdeveloped and misrepresented in a sequel like this just felt so uncaring. There were also a few characters from the series who make appearances (though I won\u2019t reveal who they were) and some were AWESOME and some were confusing, to say the least.There was a weird sexual tension between the Albus and Scorpius (which I thought was just me at first but there are tons of THINGS all over Buzzfeed and Tumblr about this so I\u2019m not alone) and I honestly thought it was going to be revealed that one had a crush on the other, or that they both shared romantic feelings.

I would have loved to see this really developed in a novel or in a series. We needed so much more time with Albus to understand him a little better. I would have loved to see this great friendship between the two boys and their complicated friendship with Rose (oh, and don\u2019t get me started about her role in the end of the book. An even cheesier way to wrap things up. Yay). I always love more time at Hogwarts. I would have loved to see those little clues along the way to the big reveal. I was okay with what the plot WAS (except for some parts) but it really just needed way more development. I kind of feel like if it can\u2019t be done well, best to leave it alone, and I don\u2019t think CURSED CHILD did justice to this series at all.We did beg for an eighth book though\u2026 so I guess beggars can\u2019t be choosers?But now can we beg for an Ilvermorny series, pretty please?

This was horrible. If it wasn't tragically getting the last word in the Harry Potter-saga, I could perhaps laugh it off, or even accept it as a weird writing experiment. But as it is, people are referring to it as the 'eight Harry Potter book', and I will not, cannot accept it. In all honesty, this was bad. And not even a charming, nostalgic, guilty pleasure kind of bad. It was all bad. Wrong. Horrid. And filled with plot holes.It's not that it is written as a play, and the overall atmosphere has been changed. Of course a change of atmosphere is to be excepted, when long descriptions of school capes and spell lessons are switched for witty lines and a fast-moving plot in order to keep an audience engaged. Of course a change of atmosphere is unavoidable, when everything needs to be doable on a stage, while keeping a reasonable pace.Rowling doesn't have time for descriptions of school capes or minor characters. She doesn't have time to invent new spells or even revisit old classes. A play is all about what you can see, and not as much about what you are told to see. I get it. And it doesn't necessarily make this a failure.What does make this a failure is however all the plot holes. The reuse of dear and beloved characters who seemed to have completely lost their purpose and integrity in the years that has passed. A blabbering Ron who only mumbles jokes and looks confused \u2013 embarrassing teenagers with love potions, even though he was nearly killed by one himself. In this play, Ron is every bit as comical and inconsequential as he himself feared he would be. Oh, and add to the mix a sobbing Dumbledore (view spoiler)[who of course is partly excused by being a portrait and thereby a shadow of himself ... but still. A sobbing Dumbledore? Even in a painting, I find it hard to believe. (hide spoiler)], an insecure Professor McGonagall, a completely insane trolley-witch (view spoiler)[(WHY was that stunt even necessary?!) (hide spoiler)], an evil Rose Granger-Weasley and a Harry Potter without any human understanding. God, I really had hoped for better fates for my favorite characters.And then, there's the plot. First of all, why timeturners and why now? It seems like such an obvious answer to Voldemort's earlier struggles, that I can hardly see why every death eater suddenly would remember them years after his downfall. It seems too convenient. Too unlikely. Why would Hermione have had the use of a time-turner in book four, if it was basically a weapon to resurrect Voldemort all this time? Why would a school-girl have been granted such a dangerous weapon, at her free disposal? No. Just no.Secondly, and perhaps more gravely, time-travel is such a lazy plot device. It allows Rowling to play largely on nostalgia; to not invent any new scenes, places or even plot points. She takes the reader back into her beloved character's past, not bothering to introduce new places, but simply to revisit. This story adds nothing new to the world of Harry Potter. It doesn't explore or even elaborate how the wizarding world works after Voldemort, but only shows us what we already know. Can you really call this a 'continuation', much less a 'contemporary Potter book', when it doesn't reveal anything about the wizarding world in 2016?And while I promised myself, I wouldn't fault the book for its form, it still feels very abrupt. A play always comes in parts, and this play comes in two, but those two parts feel like two separate stories. (view spoiler)[The split between the first time-travel problem and the next is simply too wide. The story could have been finished by Scorpius' own problem solving, and yet it keeps going on. To prove what? To do what? To repeat itself once again?! (hide spoiler)]There were times when this book felt like a joke. Almost as if Rowling was parodying herself. With concepts like Voldemort day (really? even the name sounds like child play), and even a key plot point (view spoiler)[like Bellatrix and Voldemort having a baby together \u2013 wasn't he supposed to be incapable of love? I'm having a hard time picturing him list sex as a priority -  (hide spoiler)]seems unbelievable. This book is horribly structured, its time-turner plot is completely weak and unoriginal, and the characters are flat ghosts of people I used to love. While it might work as a play on stage, it falls horribly flat on paper \u2013 and shouldn't have been published if it couldn't stand alone. I was even bored when I read this. I didn't care to find out, what happened next, because I couldn't recognize the world I'd stumbled into. The fast pacing is so ridiculous that it actually works against itself. There were things I hated. Things I loathed. And even things I could have overlooked, if it wasn't for this: I didn't care. I didn't care about my childhood friends who populates this book. The story didn't serve as a reunion, instead it served as a reminder. A reminder of places I used to go and characters I used to love. Rowling imitates herself, instead of creating something new. And that is the biggest failure of all.(Oh, and then there's the fact that Rowling really didn't write this. But as the frontcover gives her almost all the credit, so do I.)

There\u2019s no description or build up because it relies on our prior knowledge of the universe. Again, I can\u2019t complain about this because it\u2019s a script. I know some people might be feeling disappointed because one of my favourite things about the Harry Potter series was the vivid imagery that J.K. Rowling created. That\u2019s another important thing to remember J.K. Rowling didn\u2019t write this script.I know there\u2019s a lot of debate about whether this should be included in canon and I think that as long as you\u2019re being respectable that decision is entirely your own. Personally, for me, I hated the epilogue in Deathly Hallows so I just imagine book 7 ended on the last chapter. I think the great thing about books is that we can make the story our own. Canon doesn\u2019t have to be everything.The experience I had whilst reading this was absolutely magical. The moment I read the first page I felt like I had been transported back into time. It actually felt surreal. It was just so great being back in the world of Harry Potter. I was reminded just how much I loved these characters and how important this book series is to me. I had a very emotional reading experience. My parents probably thought I was crazy because I was talking to myself the whole way through. I remember walking around the house with my Kindle and taking it with me when I had to go do some grocery shopping and I felt like I was 15 again and reading Order of the Phoenix for the first time. I had the most amazing time reading this book.However, I had some issues with the plot. Again, it had nothing to do with the script format. I knew going into this to expect a rapid pace \u2013 that wasn\u2019t the problem. I hate saying this, but at times The Cursed Child read like fan fiction and not the good kind. I\u2019m in no way trying to shame fan fiction \u2013 I think it\u2019s amazing. However, as a published work I expect not to see every cliche trope that\u2019s ever existed crammed in. Maybe this is my fault for having read fan fiction since I was 14. I just feel like at times it was a bit too ridiculous and the fan service too heavily obvious.Then there\u2019s the characters. This is set nineteen years after Deathly Hallows so the Golden Trio and co. are all middle aged adults now. They definitely are going to be different to their teenage selves, but to me they felt too different at times. Certain things happened that I could NEVER imagine them doing. I\u2019m aware that everyone in this series is flawed and that\u2019s what I love about it, but even then I couldn\u2019t see some things that went down happening.\u201cThose we love never truly leave us, Harry. There are things that death cannot touch.\u201dThat\u2019s pretty much all I can say without spoiling anything. I had a seriously hard time trying to decide on a rating. If I was reviewing the plot alone it would probably be 3 stars, but reading experience would have been 5 stars. I couldn\u2019t ignore all the issues I had though so I settled on 4. I think The Cursed Child can be really enjoyable if you go in with an open mind and remember it\u2019s a play \u2013 not J.K. Rowling writing an eight novel in the series."},

Just nope. Individually, the script would make for an amazing play, but it's not fair to even compare this to the rest. It all ended with the Battle of Hogwarts, and that's how it should stay. But I also know it wouldn't be fair to compare the characterization and plot-line with the other 7. Reading a play-script is no cakewalk as it's clunky, and moreover, the only way to get to know what's happening is through the dialogue. The little things that make books so special, like character traits and pretty prose are absent, which makes it a bit harder to dip our toes back into our beloved potterverse. This is a point I wish I kept in mind before I stared: It's a script and plays are almost always better seen than read. But, that didn't stop me from freaking out over:1) Albus Severus Potter. The name itself is a work of art. (view spoiler)[ And can we please talk about the fact that he's a SLYTHERIN!!!  (hide spoiler)] Though I found it hard to sympathize with all his \"problems\", he stands for everything HP has been. He stands for Dumbledore's valor and Snape's quiet suffering. He's proof that all the lives lost in the Battle of Hogwarts haven't been for nothing, and that love may be your biggest weakness, but it will also be your biggest ally when you need it.2) Scorpius. God, the name brought tears to my eyes. Not the happy kind. Though the name itself is outrageous, this kid is a total sweetheart!! And the fact that (view spoiler)[ he's best friends with the Potter kid AND he has a crush on Ron and Hermoines' daughter Rose !!!! (hide spoiler)] just made me love him even more!3) All the time traveling and revisiting old memories. Time is not something to be messed with, and it was entertaining watching how circumstances and the simplest of decisions can make or break an entire community.4) The fast pace. A bit too much for my liking in the beginning when three years passed before I flipped even a single page, and though I guess that was necessary for the story, it just left me aggravated. But then, I got used to it and the whole play thing too, and it just made it all so much better considering all the mini heart attacks I was getting about where the book was headed.5) (view spoiler)[ HE HAS A KID.

Harry struggles to be a father, to deal with the aftermath of his childhood--his life with the Dursleys, his very justified fear of Voldemort--and I loved seeing him brought down from the perfect pedestal we often push him on. Albus, too, can't bear to be the son of Harry Potter. He's nothing like his father and though he's grateful for the world his father has given him, Hogwarts isn't a haven for him and neither is his home. I love reading dark, intense character portraits. If this entire book was just about Albus struggling to find his place, in Hogwarts and in his family, I think I could have rated it higher. Both old and new characters are given similarly complex storylines and that, for me, is where this sequel excels. However, it also fails to live up to its potential in a lot of important ways. For one, there are so many characters I was expecting to see in this and simply did not see at all: Teddy Lupin, Hugo Granger-Weasley, James and Lily Potter (very little screen time), and Neville Longbottom to name a few.The most problematic aspect of this novel, though, is its PLOT. A lot of reviewers have already mentioned this, but it bears repeating: plot holes. LOTS of plot holes. And this is a play that relies heavily on the plot, no matter how well-done the characters are. This is an entertaining read and the plot moves seamlessly, proving to be surprisingly easy to follow despite its convoluted-ness, and I have no doubt it translates well on-stage. But it felt unnecessary and rather silly. There are some very touching moments scattered throughout this play but it wasn't what I wanted it to be and it isn't a strong addition to this series. I'll be re-reading the original Harry Potter series for years to come and this, in my mind, isn't part of that."},

I just could not fathom on the idea that she - a brilliant plot writer - would condone something like...this. I was really upset when reading the big reveal scenes and the fact that they are NOT actually creating a new story but just using OLD scenes and stories in the Harry Potter books to the point where I asked, could you not create a new plot on your own? The fact that (view spoiler)[Amos Diggory was still NOT over Cedric's death is a lazy writing.

EVEN though, he was being completely nice and polite!\u2022 These kids are so mature compared to first years Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Seriously, the trio  bickered  so much.\u2022 I love Scorpius.

As minister, no less.\u2022 The thing Harry said in page 44! *gasps*\u2022 Honestly Albus isn't as smart as kid Harry and kid Harry was a bit daft, this baffles me. The decision he made!

Delphi's entire existence is just ludicrous! The fact that she is a character, the fact that this entire story is real is what really fucks me up. THE TROLLY WITCH ON THE TRAIN! So DUMB! Nostalgia is going to make people love this. And I can totally, 100%, absolutely see how seeing this in theatres would be epic and wonderful and exciting. Action, drama, all of your fave characters coming back to life. James and Lily being parents irl!!! But that doesn't cover up the fact that this play, this story, is garbage. In short all of the characters felt false, the plot itself was illogical and just horrifying from a storytelling standpoint, and it threw in too many things to make it seem genuine. It seemed more like a fanservice that got way out of hand and that it was just these two guys wanting to make their BAD fanfiction come to life and somehow got JKR to approve it.*EDIT* I just really needed to include this, it has been bothering me for two days now. The relationship between Scorpius and Albus is wonderful and horrible. They are great friends andI love that there is such a positive friendship HOWEVER this friendship is laced, doused, covered, drenched, dipped, and saturated with queer baiting. Scorpius has a crush on Rose from the beginning but really anyone who reads this will instantly think that there is romantic chemistry between Scorpius and Albus and, in fact, be so sure of it that they would expect that to be the end result. But it's not. And really, coming from someone who ships Rosius, that pissed me off more than anything else. Those two boys clearly loved each other beyond friends and this fucking play used and abused the need for canon queer characters (THAT ACTUALLY ADMIT TO BEING QUEER IN THE BOOKS) and that makes me irate. It is queer baiting 1000% and it's disgusting.To quote someone else \"the real cursed child is me for having read that plot.\" And to make an amendment to that: the real cursed child is me for having prayed for an eighth book all while knowing that you should be careful what you wish for."},

And, it's not a round up sort of deal for me. I'm, sadly, going to have to round down to two stars because it fits the overwhelming sense of disappointment I have lingering.Original review:I already know how I'm going to split up this review. There's going to be a short section that gives my feelings without going into specifics. I don't want to spoil this for anyone at all, so I'll be brief and frank. After that, completely marked under spoilers, is going to be a section where I get into things like I usually do. Specific plot points, characterization, writing, etc. Full of spoilers.The first thing I want to say is that this is basically fanfiction. A major plot in the book is taken from things that have been written a million times. Of course, it was written decently and it's (partially) by JK Rowling, but fanfiction is fanfiction for me. Especially fanfiction that copies things I've read a million times. I feel people should go into this knowing that. I went into it -- not having read any early reviews or spoilers for the show -- expecting that's what it would be like. Again, it's well-written and legitimate, unlike most fanfiction, but it's still fanfiction. Expect that it's not going to be perfect, nor will it really have the same feel the Harry Potter books did for me.For me, the first 20% was more like two stars. From 30% on, it got better, up to three stars. Despite my issues with the major plot and a few other things, it got up to 3.5 stars. I'm still trying to decide where I want to rate it exactly (because GR doesn't do half stars, when it should), but for now, I'm going to round down to three stars.I touched on this in my review of Deathly Hallows, but, for me, \"Nineteen Years Later\" is the end of the series for me. Just like how I feel about the show Supernatural; season five is the end, everything else is just supplemental. This is just supplemental information. I'm disregarding certain things from the play, but I am going to keep some. The series ends, in my heart, with Deathly Hallows.From here on out, the rest of my review is going to be marked for spoilers. Please don't look below if you haven't read it! I already gave my opinion -- and I hope that I don't sully anyone's reading experience because of my slightly more negative review -- but further down I'm going to hash out the plot, characters, and writing.(view spoiler)[When I first started this, I could tell that it wasn't written by JK. I felt it in my heart and in my gut completely. Part of the issues I have, which I'll get into later, is due to the writing. Some of the things I felt were genuine JK -- like Dumbledore's role and speaking parts or Harry's emotions -- but others just didn't feel like her. I've read all of her work. I know her style. This wasn't it. Yes, I understand plays are different than books, but still.Since I started with my problems with the writing, I'm going to start with something that annoyed me from beginning to end. A minor quibble, yes. Those stage directions. I don't like it when it's telling not showing. You can do it in a play. And, those stage directions told me how characters felt. I could have gathered it from the writing well enough. I about got to the point where I stopped reading the stage directions, but then I realized that if I got lost by not reading stage directions during Shakespeare and many other plays, then I ought to just grit my teeth and bear it.The thing that bothered me next was characterization. I actually didn't have a problem with Draco, Harry, Hermione, Ron, or Ginny. Those main five were well done and they felt authentic. Part of me thinks that JK more had a say in them than anyone else. Harry's mess, Ginny's mothering, Ron's humor, Hermione's split attention on family and running the Ministry, Draco's sheltering. It felt authentic and understandable. What did bother me was the kids and the minor characters.At the beginning Albus, Scorpius, and Rose are eleven. However, they don't read like eleven year olds. I read them as older than eleven. However, when they get older to the point in the majority of the play, they either sounded younger than or a touch older than fourteen. For me, that distracted from the play at times. Again, not a huge problem, but it detracted from my enjoyment.I did love Albus and Scorpius. Is it so bad that I really wanted them to be a gay couple? HP needs more LGBT+ characters. Their friendship was done well, and if she ever wrote more, I want to hope that they became a couple. I was never a fan of Rose/Scorpius, but I was always a fan of Albus/Scorpius. Especially since they're both Slytherins. (I actually fist pumped the air when Albus got sorted.)What was inauthentic was the minor characters. I'm going to more point out Amos Diggory, Umbridge, and Moaning Myrtle. Amos was... not how he was in the books. In the books, he was grieving, yes, but he wasn't upset. He never was upset or angry. I know, years can rankle and all that, but... that much? I understand he was Confunded, yet it still didn't feel right. I wasn't a fan of his characterization. Umbridge... no. The writers didn't capture her at all, another thing that made me shake my head. Same with Myrtle. I was just surprised that the Dursleys, Snape, and Hagrid weren't ruined as well. And, that scene with Hagrid and baby Harry. My little heart simultaneously broke and grew three sizes that day.Here comes major spoilers, though. The plot. In my opinion, there were two plots. First, the actual story that was being told with Voldemort's daughter and changing history. Second, the more emotional plot of father/son relationships.As for the Voldemort daughter plot.... fanfiction. Pure fanfiction shit right there. Do you know how many times I've read that plot? Too many times. Sometimes it's well done, most of the time it's not. This is one of those cases where I didn't like it. Quite honestly, I didn't. Like most fanfiction, there was a huge plot hole. If Bellatrix had Delphie (which she now did in the HP universe because this is the canonically eighth book) someone would have noticed. I'm not very good at math, so someone correct me while I go more into this. According to an article I read, Delphi is 23. Albus and Scorpius are in their fourth year, which means it's about 2019. That makes Delphi born around 1996. Plot wise, that works. Bellatrix could have given birth to her since she wasn't there, for some odd reason, when Snape killed Dumbledore. However, she would have been 45 giving birth. I don't know about magical reproduction, but even by today's standards that's pretty old to have a child. And, I know that all what she dealt with in Azkaban it probably would have severely restricted her fertile years. So... I have a hard time wrapping around it.Not only that, but the plot felt lame. Wow. Voldemort's daughter. Who would have guessed??? They should have left Voldemort out, same with all the time changing. It just didn't work, quite honestly. Feel free to disagree, but I felt like I was reading middle school fanfiction all over again.The plot that worked, though, was the second one. They should have cut out the Voldy daughter stuff and focused on the relationships between parent and child. I know, Voldy's daughter had that, too, but as a whole it failed for me. They should have focused on relationships. Harry and Albus. Draco and Scorpius. Harry and Draco, even. (No, not slash fiction, but given Draco even more redemption than he got in this book by the two of them becoming friends.)The heart of the play was with that feeling. A father trying to understand their son. Trying to work with the past as it becomes a reality. A child trying to cope with their father's legacy. That is some deep shit, and that's the reason why it got bumped up as they focused more on that while doing their fanfiction plot. I thought that was absolutely beautiful and the only reason I would ever reread this play is for that aspect, to get more depth from it.

Their friendship was done well, and if she ever wrote more, I want to hope that they became a couple. I was never a fan of Rose/Scorpius, but I was always a fan of Albus/Scorpius. Especially since they're both Slytherins. (I actually fist pumped the air when Albus got sorted.)What was inauthentic was the minor characters. I'm going to more point out Amos Diggory, Umbridge, and Moaning Myrtle. Amos was... not how he was in the books. In the books, he was grieving, yes, but he wasn't upset. He never was upset or angry. I know, years can rankle and all that, but... that much? I understand he was Confunded, yet it still didn't feel right. I wasn't a fan of his characterization. Umbridge... no. The writers didn't capture her at all, another thing that made me shake my head. Same with Myrtle. I was just surprised that the Dursleys, Snape, and Hagrid weren't ruined as well. And, that scene with Hagrid and baby Harry. My little heart simultaneously broke and grew three sizes that day.Here comes major spoilers, though. The plot. In my opinion, there were two plots. First, the actual story that was being told with Voldemort's daughter and changing history. Second, the more emotional plot of father/son relationships.As for the Voldemort daughter plot.... fanfiction. Pure fanfiction shit right there. Do you know how many times I've read that plot? Too many times. Sometimes it's well done, most of the time it's not. This is one of those cases where I didn't like it. Quite honestly, I didn't. Like most fanfiction, there was a huge plot hole. If Bellatrix had Delphie (which she now did in the HP universe because this is the canonically eighth book) someone would have noticed. I'm not very good at math, so someone correct me while I go more into this. According to an article I read, Delphi is 23. Albus and Scorpius are in their fourth year, which means it's about 2019. That makes Delphi born around 1996. Plot wise, that works. Bellatrix could have given birth to her since she wasn't there, for some odd reason, when Snape killed Dumbledore. However, she would have been 45 giving birth. I don't know about magical reproduction, but even by today's standards that's pretty old to have a child. And, I know that all what she dealt with in Azkaban it probably would have severely restricted her fertile years. So... I have a hard time wrapping around it.Not only that, but the plot felt lame. Wow. Voldemort's daughter. Who would have guessed??? They should have left Voldemort out, same with all the time changing. It just didn't work, quite honestly. Feel free to disagree, but I felt like I was reading middle school fanfiction all over again.The plot that worked, though, was the second one. They should have cut out the Voldy daughter stuff and focused on the relationships between parent and child. I know, Voldy's daughter had that, too, but as a whole it failed for me. They should have focused on relationships. Harry and Albus. Draco and Scorpius. Harry and Draco, even. (No, not slash fiction, but given Draco even more redemption than he got in this book by the two of them becoming friends.)The heart of the play was with that feeling. A father trying to understand their son. Trying to work with the past as it becomes a reality. A child trying to cope with their father's legacy. That is some deep shit, and that's the reason why it got bumped up as they focused more on that while doing their fanfiction plot. I thought that was absolutely beautiful and the only reason I would ever reread this play is for that aspect, to get more depth from it. (hide spoiler)]"},

Rowling, John Tiffany, Jack Thorne There have been a lot of feelings flying around since the announcement of the \u201c8th Harry Potter book\u201d, especially once it sunk in that this was going to be the script of the West End play, rather than the format so many Harry Potter fans have grown up expecting.There was excitement, of course, followed closely by the concern that a script would be hard to get lost in, and that maybe our dear J.K. was perhaps jumping the shark. There was talk about the possibility that this would be about Albus, Scorpius, and Rose, as mentioned in the epilogue of the seventh book, attending Hogwarts and becoming the new \u201cpower trio\u201d.But there is so much more to this story, and it went off in a direction that many of us won\u2019t have expected.Those who live in London will be able to appreciate this story in all of its glory, but that doesn\u2019t mean those of us in other parts of the world can\u2019t find a certain amount of joy in the pages of this book.All things considered, it is a return to the world of Hogwarts for those of us who have so missed it. It\u2019s difficult to write a review for this book without giving things away, as everything has been kept so secret, but I\u2019ll do my very best!If you don\u2019t want to know anything about the actual plot before going in, I can tell you this:- There\u2019s laughter, and touching moments, and heartache, friendship, and drama, and adventure.- We revisit some of the characters and places we\u2019ve grown so familiar with over the last seven books.- It\u2019s a little light on the character development, but that\u2019s understandable because it\u2019s a script.- Though it is a script, it\u2019s easy to read.- You cannot read this without having read the other seven or seen the movies. There are spoilers, and there are things that won\u2019t make as much sense without that foundation. This is not a jumping-in point for people who haven\u2019t read or watched any of the previous adventures, though it stands well enough in its own right that you can still enjoy it, even if you last read the books or saw the movies many many years ago.- If you\u2019ve seen the movies enough, you will no doubt hear your beloved returning characters speaking, as they perform the play in your head.- You should read it.- Great fun can be had if you get a group of friends together, pick your characters, and do a table read, as this reviewer did.The rest of this review can be found HERE!"},

Amos Diggory comes to attack Harry for Cedric's death 23 years after it happened.6. Harry Potter would never to say to Albus that he wished he wasn't his son. After all the shit Dursleys put him through, he would never be a shithead to his kid. After growing up unloved and practically abused, he would never, ever do that. Harry Potter, whose greatest joy was when Molly hugged him and (finally) showed him love, he would never look at Albus, small, confused, lost little boy and wish he could change him. Wish he was more like his brother and sister, when Albus is the one who is similar to Harry the most.7. Dark Magic moves around you while you have a nightmare? What the fuck??8. Albus Potter makes out with Hermione. Yes, he was polyjuiced as Ron at the time but still. Ew. She is his fricking aunt.9. Ron is a babbling idiot who does nothing but stuff his face.10. Queer baiting. Let's be real, if Albus was a boy and Scorpious a girl, they would be married with 5 kids by now. But since they're both men, they can't possibly be more than friends.11. Instead of talking to his son, Harry fucks up like 7 times in 7 identical situations.12. Voldemort day? Really?13. The plot is stupid. Albus Potter feels like an outcast and like his father hates him (which is... Not far from truth. At least according to Harry's behaviour). He makes friends with Scorpious Malfoy, who is also an outcast not only because his father is a former Death Eater, but because the public believes he's Voldemort's son (??????). One night they overhear Amos Diggory talking to Harry Potter (23 years later...?). Amos wants Harry to travel back in time to stop Voldemort from killing Cedric. (How would that even work? Wouldn't Harry then have to live for 23 years in the past before reaching a point in the present when he went back in the past?) So, boys decide to be heroes and help Amos and his niece Delphi go back in time and save Cedric. They steal Time-Turner- a pretty shitty one, you can only stay in past for 5 minutes. They see all kind of realities- the one where Voldemort lives, where he dies but everything is different, etc. Oh and Voldemort apparently wins if Cedric lives because... Cedric turns evil, joins Death Eaters and kills Neville. You know why? Because HE WAS APPARENTLY EMBARRASSED. What the hell is this bullshit? Cedric, who fucking shared trophy with Harry, who loved fair play, who was ambitious and kind, joined Lord Voldemort because people laughed at him? Jesus.Oh, but that's not all. We haven't reached the plot twist yet.14. The plot twist is so fucking dumb. It turns out Delphi is not Amos' niece. She is daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. She turns on Albus and Scorpiuos and goes to the night when Harry's parents died to kill Harry. Of course, she fails miserably. Do I even need to explain how stupid this is? Voldemort having sex? Bellatrix carrying a baby without anyone noticing? Delphi growing up without anyone knowing anything about her? VOLDEMORT HAVING SEX??15. Harry blames everyone but himself for his faults as a parent.16. Where is Ginny? You know, mother of Albus and wife of Harry? She, like Ron, has about, what, 2 lines?17. Malfoy waits until his son goes missing for the 3049th time to reveal that he has another Time-Turner.18. Apparently the only way for deathly ill woman to have a kid is to give birth to it. Adoption? Nah, what is that.19. The writing is horrible. I cringed at most of the lines. 20. Harry Potter would never fucking say to Minerva that she is bitter because she can't have kids. The script tries to convince me that Harry would say that to his former professor? To the woman he, if nothing else, respected a lot? The only time he managed to cast a Cruciatius curse was when a Death Eater spat on Minerva in front of Harry. Not when his godfather died, not when Hermione was tortured, not when plenty of other shitty things happened in his shitty life. The only time he could cast it when someone disrespected Minerva. And you're telling me that he would say all those things to her?! You're fucking kidding me.21. The ending is basically 'and they lived happy ever after'. Harry resolving his issues with his son? Draco with his? Ginny/Ron/Lily actually being in this book? Nah bruh.22. Everything.This abomination just took a huge dump on my entire childhood. Bye.+one decent thing: Scorpious was really cute."},

I thought it was going to be really hard to get into the swing of reading it in play form, but it took no time for it to feel like I was just reading another book! The only thing I hated was how quickly it flew by! I just need more!! *insert hysterically crying emoji here* I felt like Albus was the perfect son for Harry as he was just like Harry, but in a totally different and unexpected way. ALSO can we just talk about how Scorpius is my favorite character of life! He is so funny, and in my opinion made this story so much better in so many ways! You honestly have a different view of Slytherin and the Malfoys all together after reading this! I loved all the moments we got of some of our favorite characters as well! Not to mention I LOVED the plot! It was so thrilling and legit terrifying at times! I am slightly disappointed that I didn't get to see one of two characters, but lets get real we can't have everything we want (which is an entirely new series with all old and new characters asap). I will definitely have a full spoilery discussion on my channel asap, so I can fully express all of my feels, but guys just guys! I loved it so much! I just need more. I am so thankful that on Harry's birthday I had the pleasure of reading a new book in Harry's world and life after 15 years of this being my life. I could not have asked for more from this book. JK ROWLING I NEED A SERIES ASAP. "},

At the end, I added my thoughts and feelings that have developed throughout the day. I'm sorry that this is the biggest mess of a review ever but honestly it's not as much of a mess as I am. ALSO SORRY THIS IS SO LONG I HAVE SO MANY FEELINGS OKAY SHOOT ME IT'S BEEN NINE YEARSI literally just finished the book and I'm still crying so I'm trying to put all my thoughts together. I'm completely in love with this. I'm more desperate than ever to see it on stage so I can truly experience this as it was meant to be experienced. I'm trying to write things but I keep thinking about what I've just read and started crying all over again ahhhOkay, I'm going to try this.I cannot describe to you how happy I am to see these characters that I have grown up with again in a brand new story. (Update: my cat just left me because I'm crying so much) I can't really explain my feelings towards Harry Potter, but it means so much to me, and I'm sure other people can relate. I was so excited to finally learn more about who they are now (well, who they'll be in the coming years ho ho). I will say before I start this properly, I think, as somebody who has done a lot of stage acting, I found it a lot easier to kind of imagine the story and flow a lot better in my mind than some other people might. That being said there are parts of the play that I just really hope translate onto the stage better than they did on paper because dear god it did not read well (in my humble opinion don't eat me).I was thinking for a while that I definitely favoured Part One of the play over Part Two. However, after finishing, I think maybe I prefer Part Two?? I don't know Part Two made me cry more. But I'll start with Part One because... it's the first part?? Makes sense. Yay Sophie!!I loved everything about Part One. There was a lot of nostalgia and excitement over these \"new\" characters. It just... I can't describe it it was just such a brilliant beginning for me. There are so many emotions thrown around in just the first act that you're left almost exhausted by the end. (view spoiler)[ A list of things that made me cry in just the first 75 pages of this book: Astoria's death, Amos talking about Cedric, Harry remembering Cedric, HARRY JAMES POTTER GIVING ALBUS SEVERUS POTTER THE BLANKETHE WAS WRAPPED IN WHEN HE WAS LEFT ON THE DURSLEY'S DOORSTEP BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY THING HE HAS OF HIS MOTHER'S!!!!!!! (hide spoiler)] Needless to say, I cried a lot. Now there is only one problem I had with this Part, and it at the very end of Act Two. I'm sure it will translate better onto the stage but just having it written in front of you, it's really funny. I laughed way more than I was probably supposed to, it just looked a little ridiculous?? (view spoiler)[ \"YOU'RE RUINING VOLDEMORT DAY\" BYE I SCREAMED FRICKIN VOLDEMORT DAY DEAD DONE RIP ME (hide spoiler)] I don't know, other people might think differently but I just thought it was.. I don't know I think it probably doesn't translate that well on paper.Now Part Two, I'm not going to lie, I wasn't super into Act Three. Towards the end, I really enjoyed it but the beginning was very \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" if yah know what I'm saying. Again other people may feel differently, but I really hope that it translates better onto the stage because to me it just read weird. (view spoiler)[ The re-introduction of Snape was just completely bizarre to me and I felt he was very out of character. Like, I get where it's coming from, I understand the time change thingy (wow, Sophie) but, I just can't see Hermione and Ron getting alone with Snape like that and just.. him in general... it felt wrong.  (hide spoiler)] Act Three actually kind of reminded me of a mixture of A Very Potter Sequel and My Immortal, so I'm kinding of really hoping it is as horrifying as the stage directions and such are suggesting and not just a giant meme.Act Four, however was just, incredible to me. Again, I'm really struggling to put my feelings into words because I'm just so blown away by this play. (view spoiler)[ Not gonna lie tho, I'm not really into Delphi as a villain, and the idea that she's Voldemort's daughter I just... nah... however I CALLED IT I KNEW VOLDEMORT AND BELLATRIX BANGED AT SOME POINT (hide spoiler)] I loved everything about this Act, it was just... so perfect I can't describe it. I honest to god cried from midway scene eleven through the rest of the play. I am nursing the worst crying headache ever right now. (view spoiler)[ Having to see Harry watch his parents die honestly killed me. Hagrid greeting little baby Harry killed me. Harry and Albus' walk and talking about Cedric and just everything about Scene Fifteen done killed me. Basically Scenes Twelve through Fifteen had me dead. (hide spoiler)]I can't really give my full feelings for this play without spoiling it, I'm that person that needs to go into full detail yah know? Also without having actually seen the play performed as it is intended, it is a little bit more difficult to judge than your regular novel. I just want to say that I am so, so glad that Harry Potter is back in our lives. I don't think I've cried so much a book since The Deathly Hallows came out. But please, if you are considering not reading this book because you have heard some spoilers, or rumours that it isn't very good, read it. You will regret it so much. I was so afraid to read it because I thought it wouldn't live up to my expectations, and it did all that and so much more.THANK YOU J.K. ROWLING FOR GRACING US WITH THIS PLAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU AND TO HARRY u0026lt;3ANOTHER UPDATE: I've been thinking about this book all day, and I've kind of got a bit more of a handle on my opinions now I think (I've also been on the verge of tears all day and I just had a nice little cry a few minutes ago). Now, I absolutely love this play, but I did feel a little conflicted about certain aspects and I've been mulling things over and checking out what some other people had to say and I reached some conclusions. I realised that my favourite parts of the play were the parts where you see the parts where it truly feels like you're seeing how the events of the novels affected the characters twenty-odd years later, or the parts where you just see the characters we've grown up with interacting with eachother and with the newer characters. One thing I particularly liked was the portrayal of Harry dealing with the feeling of guilt over all the lives that were lost for him. (view spoiler)[ \"I shouldn\u2019t have survived - it was my destiny to die \u2014 even Dumbledore thought so \u2014 and yet I lived. I beat Voldemort. All these people \u2014 all these people \u2014 my parents, Fred, the Fallen Fifty \u2014 and it\u2019s me that gets to live? How is that? All this damage \u2014 and it\u2019s my fault.\" (hide spoiler)] I've always wondered if he felt guilt over the events of the past, especially after the Nineteen Years Later epilogue which made everything seem fine and dandy. And even though I had always believed that the way Harry is confirmed to feel in the play would be the way he would feel, I was still completely heartbroken. Even now, I'm crying again just thinking about it (god this play kill me please). I'm so glad that this was something the play dealt with.Again, Harry calling Dumbledore out on how he treated him when he was in school and how that affected him later in life was just so satisfying. (view spoiler)[ I'm not going to get into the whole Snape thing honestly I'm still confused by it. (hide spoiler)] This play had a lot of closure for things I've been questioning for the last nine years. Finally, those last few scenes just completely destroyed me. I'm going to block all this for spoilers because I can't really see a way I can talk about this without spoiling anything. (view spoiler)[ Godric's Hollow. Just... oh my god. I don't think I've ever experienced a scene more intense than the scene where they watch Lily and James die. It was just so traumatic. I mean, it impacted me so much just reading it, I can hardly imagine what it would be like to be sitting in that theatre and having it happen in front of you. I can't really put into words how much this scene impacted me. I'm just so heartbroken and I think it will definitely haunt me for a long time. (hide spoiler)]Now things I had problems with. I think I mentioned it in my initial reaction that there are so many characters that I wanted to know how they were doing now, how they were coping or whatever and there wasn't even a mention of them. I wasn't expecting every single character to be in the play but they couldn't even bring them up in coversation? (view spoiler)[ They can bring Snape back but can't even mention how Ginny's best friend Luna is doing?? (hide spoiler)] There are one or two things that I wasn't super into either. Act Three was just a mess. It got good toward the end of the act but I just wasn't loving it. (view spoiler)[ I liked the time travelling and the alternate universes or whatever but I'm still not over that world where Voldemort wins. I know on stage it would be incredible and would translate better but.. I don't know it was just weird to me.. ALSO SNAPE MADE NO SENSE DID NOT ENJOY WHY WAS HE THAT WAY???? (hide spoiler)] Also, I really wish Scorpius was in Ravenclaw?? Does anybody see this or is it just me?? u0026gt;.u0026gt; I wish Jo would give the other two houses a little more attention than she does idk (view spoiler)[ ALSO OKAY WHILE I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT VOLDIE AND BELLATRIX BANGED IT WAS 100% BECAUSE OF AVPM AND NOTHING ELSE SO THIS WEIRD DELPHI THING IS JUST NOPE HATE IT YUCKO (hide spoiler)]Anyway, I can't really think of anything else to say right now. I'm getting too upset (like really if other people haven't reacted the same way i have then i don't know who you people are anymore). I'll be rereading the play once I finish the last three book in the series so I can form more opinions maybe??Either way, I think the play is perfect. Yes, I wish some things were done differently but it is more than I could have ever asked for. I'm going to go and cry a little more over this perfect addition to my absolute favourite series of all time.(Sorry this is so long oh my god I just feel very ranty about this book and nobody I know has READ IT YET KILL MEEEEE)UPDATE: So I just found out that J.K. Rowling didn't actually write this play and I'm unbelievably disappointed and not even a little bit surprised anymore that parts of it read like fanfiction. I FEEL SO BETRAYED WHAT THE HELLalso for those of you that don't know, my tweet about me crying so much i almost threw up was put on pottermore so soz guys i'm famous now xo[ A list of things that made me cry in just the first 75 pages of this book: Astoria's death, Amos talking about Cedric, Harry remembering Cedric, HARRY JAMES POTTER GIVING ALBUS SEVERUS POTTER THE BLANKETHE WAS WRAPPED IN WHEN HE WAS LEFT ON THE DURSLEY'S DOORSTEP BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY THING HE HAS OF HIS MOTHER'S!!!!!!!

I nearly marked this as DNF, were it not for the fact that my boss at work had graciously lent it to me. I believe that I'm not being objective right now because irritation is clouding my judgement. All I know is that Albus Severus Potter never failed to fill my heart with scorn and contempt. His decision making process was remarkably pathetic at best and downright infuriating at worst. There were so many times that I wanted\u2014yearned\u2014to throw this ridiculously expensive text across the room, through the window, and onto the gritty pavement outside.Please believe me that I did my best to enjoy the story. Unfortunately, I was overwhelmed by this feeling of detachment towards the characters. It was hard for me to reconcile their dialogues to the people they were 19 years ago. Harry, Ron, and Hermione were just...there, and I really wasn't invested in their story anymore. I now realize that other readers were right to describe this play as fan-fiction; there were indeed so many conveniently executed plot holes involving Cedric Diggory, Voldemort, and those blasted Time-Turners. As my rant comes to a close, I hope that I can redeem myself by saying\u2014with a small smile\u2014that I liked Scorpius. Honestly, he was my only ray of sunshine, my rare source of comfort and fanboy feels. His pedantic demeanor and love for books inevitably reminded me of my adoration for Hermione, and I particularly admired his willingness to express his affection for Albus. Scorpius basically changed my opinion of the Malfoy name for the better, and for that I am grateful.All things considered, I am not satisfied nor happy with how the story turned out. It would probably be better if I didn't read it at all. Nevertheless, I assure you that my love for Lady Rowling and her wizarding world remain unscathed. In fact, I shall begin reading Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire to purge myself of remaining toxic emotions. "},

To anyone who has seen the Very Potter musicals; did you giggle at how the plot this seemed slightly familiar in a certain way? ;)I loved it. It was everything I wanted and more. There were several things I was not expecting, in typical JK Rowling fashion; I wouldn't expect any less. So many of the stage directions made me so excited to someday seen this play performed live.~Update after seeing so many negative reviews ~I feel like so many people are trying to make this book into something it's just not; comparing it to 'bad fanfiction' and being annoyed that this \"8th\" book is even a thing. I hate that this is marketed as an eight book because that's really not at all what it is. It's not a continuation of Harry's story, which we followed through the original seven books, it's not even a book technically. It is first and foremost a staged script, full of stage directions in which J.K. Rowling's voice and humor from the original characters can clearly be heard even in this format through dialogue.People that go into this with the mindset that they are reading \"another Harry Potter book\" just like all of the other books that we know and love are clearly going to be disappointed with what they find. I think the review I've seen the most that annoys me to no end is the people saying that 'it reads like bad fanfiction'. First of all, this is the official rehearsal script of a, so far, successful sold out play that is currently running on London's West End. If it wasn't good or didn't stay true to the heart of the Harry Potter world and to the characters we know and love, including all of the new characters we only got to see a single chapter of in the epilogue that are being reintroduced to us, there is no way that J.K. Rowling would have allowed this to be professionally produced. As a theatre lover myself, I can guarantee you that a stage script of a show is NOTHING compared to actually seeing the show performed live no matter how many times you read it and think you know what to expect. For those of us who haven't seen the play (which is most of us, let's be honest) we cannot judge and criticize this show based simply on a single rehearsal script, which might not even be the final product when the show reaches the point of being completely finished and ready for the world to experience. So many things change throughout the rehearsal process; the producers, directors, lighting designers, costume designers, casting directors, etc and obviously Rowling herself are going to work hard at this show until it is the best that it can be. They will make sure that it grows into something that will one day be able to open in other parts of the world to make it more accessible for fans of the Wizarding world that Rowling has created to be able to see it worldwide. It's run in London is only the first step in a very long process that will help bring the stage magic up to par in order for it to make its way out into the world. We just have to be patient and be happy that they released a script at all, to give us a small idea of what to expect of the basic storyline that this play will unfold to us whenever we do get the chance to see it performed. Honestly you just have to accept this script for what it is; a little dip back into the Wizarding World that all of us know and love. And I am perfectly content with just that.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~- Reread August 2016 -I still stand by my five star rating for this and have even more appreciation after rereading it and tabbing the crap out of it; spending some more time analyzing it this time. I still say that it is NOT an eighth Harry Potter book; it is a play SCRIPT set years and years later and has to abide by the rules of theatre and therefore real life. I'll save the rest of my ranty review defending it for my spoilery review video ;)"},

As some of you might know, I'm a bit of a Darcy Malfoy fan. Not just because of Tom Felton, but because of the character itself.Anyway, I read the book as soon I was able to get my hands on it. Reading this book felt like seeing and catching up with friends you haven't seen in a long time. Harry Potter has been a huge part of my childhood, and to see them all grown up\u2014married and with kids, too\u2014made me ecstatic. The magic is still there in my heart.We see a lot of familiar faces\u2014Harry, Hermione, Ron, Draco, Professor McGonagall, to name a few\u2014and new ones\u2014Albus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy, the Granger-Weasley kids, the next generation students. This was enjoyable as a standalone, and the script made me want to watch the play, but it was hard to accept as canon. There were a lot of plot holes and some of the characters seemed OOC (out of character). There were times when I felt I was reading a fan fic. Some of it felt like it was written purely for fan service (Am I right, Dramione fans?). The thing that bothered me the most was Draco Malfoy. I've always believed he could have been different if he was given the chance to be Harry and co.'s friend. In this play/script, we were able to see and understand Draco, and I felt bad for him because he wasn't truly evil; just misguided. If he had the right friends, things would have been different. But I shouldn't be lamenting over the past, so I'm going to let it go. It just sucked to be proven right, I guess. There was some consolation though. There was a bit of a redemption for Draco, and Scorpius was a darling. He was a mix of Ron and Hermione, having Ron's sense of humor and Hermione's wit. I think that's what it made him perfect as Albus' best friend. There was also a scene with a beloved character (After all this time?) that warmed my heart. All in all, I was happy I read this, but it wouldn't have been a loss if I didn't. I still hope The Cursed Child would tour someday because I would still like to see it.   "},

The plot itself is a poorly-conceived and sometimes-confusing time-travel excursion, allowing the authors to look at a couple of \"what-if\" scenarios from the Harry Potter Universe, giving the play a very 'fan-fiction' feel.In general, I must admit, I don't enjoy reading theatrical scripts or screenplays. I feel that they're designed to be seen, not read, and that they're missing the huge, essential half of the equation that talented actors are expected to bring to the stage. There are exceptions, of course, great plays that are amazing both on the page and on stage... but this is not one. Supposedly, this publication is \"based on\" a story idea by JK Rowling. Obviously, I don't know how much of the idea was hers, but it's worth mentioning that she did not actually write any of the words of this play - it's distinctly not her writing style.I didn't have extremely high expectations of this, but nevertheless, it was still disappointing.

Then hesitant, when I realised it wasn't really fully written by the beloved J.K. Rowling. Then hesitation gave way to apprehension, when I realised it was gonna be in the form of a script book. Bad idea. Really bad idea.A play is a performance put up by actors and actresses who breathe life into the characters they portray. We have props, colours, movements, sounds. The engagement of the audience is central in a play in ensuring that they are captivated and emotionally invested. A script (a rehearsal script, at that) disguised as a book fails to deliver the connection and emotions readers crave for. I want to FEEL, but I felt nothing. The years go by really quickly, I didn't get a chance to get to really know Albus and Scorpius. I couldn't comprehend why Albus did what he did - I couldn't deduce the reason for such a reckless act. Because it sure doesn't make things better, nor improve (view spoiler)[his relationship with Harry (hide spoiler)]. Almost everyone was out of character, specifically Draco Malfoy. One optimist reviewer felt that love changed Draco Malfoy to be a better man. The cynical me finds that a total bull. I mean, sure love could possibly make you a better person. But this Draco Malfoy is as sensible as Hermione! That is preposterous. And don't get me started on Harry and (view spoiler)[Albus Dumbeldore (hide spoiler)]! They were ridiculously sappy and I had wanted to smack Harry with my Harry Potter books 4 to 7. But to be fair, all these could have been avoided if book 8 was an ACTUAL NOVELISATION of the play!It took me a couple of scenes to really get into the story because i tend to read the names of the characters. It was worse during the scene at the Ministry of Magic when they had the polyjuice and both names appeared at the sideline. But it wasn't so bad after a while. You just gotta bulldoze your way in.(view spoiler)[And Voldemort and Bellatrix getting it on - INCOMPREHENSIBLE! I just cannot fathom this fact. It's like you denying your parents EVER had sex. This feels exactly like that. My childhood story is ruined. *cries* (hide spoiler)]I would have given this a 2.5 stars but Albus and Scorpius deserved some points. They were reckless yet entertaining and hilarious. And Ron, damnit, he was by far the one and only character who remained in character with his dry jokes that are so silly, they were actually funny. Loved it.When I read HPCC, it was as if I was reading Rainbow Rowell's Fangirl where Cath writes fan fiction of her favourite series, which in actual fact refers to the Harry Potter series. I hated those parts in Fangirl and eventually skipped those chapters. This was equally as bad. And yet, I still shelved it under my 'Favourite' shelf. *shrugs*All in all, HPCC is entertaining enough to keep you rooted for a few hours. Can be easily completed in one sitting cos even though it's a 330-page book, the actual number of reading pages is lesser than that. Good, just not 'Harry Potter Epic Level'.Conclusion: Don't let my rating and review influence you. But brace yourself if it doesn't match up to your high expectation.Update: Many, many months before the release...I'm waiting for this in trepidation. And like what Stephen Colbert says:...the play actually takes place 19 years after the last book, and features a thirty-something Harry balancing his job at the Ministry of Magic with being a father. THAT...really sounds depressing. But let's all admit that Harry Potter's life peaked at 17; Captain of the Quidditch team, big Chosen One on campus, now he's just some guy.Who's his enemy even going to be? Phil from Accounting? A slowing metabolism? A vague restless feeling when he looks at travel posters?Damn, I don't need a book about that. I could look at my life!Oh god, could I handle the disappointment if it suck?[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[his relationship with Harry (hide spoiler)][Albus Dumbeldore (hide spoiler)][And Voldemort and Bellatrix getting it on - INCOMPREHENSIBLE!

Wundervoller, wenn auch \u00fcberraschend d\u00fcsterer Ausflug. Inhalt..................Es handelt sich hier streng genommen nicht um eine typische Fortsetzung der Harry-Potter Reihe. \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" ist ein Theaterst\u00fcck, das zeitlich 20 Jahre nach dem letzten Band spielt. Harry ist erwachsen geworden, doch sein Abenteuer ist l\u00e4ngst nicht zu Ende. Nun verheiratet und als Vater dreier Kinder stellen sich beruflich und privat ganz neue Herausforderungen. Gerade sein Sohn Albus h\u00e4lt ihn auf Trapp, beide geraten nicht nur einmal aneinander. Doch diesen Zwist m\u00fcssen beide begraben, denn die magische Welt wird erneut bedroht und nur einer kann sie retten...Zur Klarstellung: \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" ist ausschlie\u00dflich in Dialogform geschrieben und kein \"echtes\" Buch.Mein Eindruck.....................................Ich muss sagen, ich war von Beginn an verzaubert. Nat\u00fcrlich, die Skriptform ist auf den ersten paar Seiten ungewohnt. Doch schon nach ein, zwei Szenen... es ist, als w\u00e4re man wieder zu Hause angekommen. All die lieb gewonnen Figuren kommen wieder vor, zwar nat\u00fcrlich um Jahre \u00e4lter, aber am Prinzip hat sich nicht viel ver\u00e4ndert. Gro\u00dfer Dreh- und Angelpunkt ist die Vater-Sohn-Beziehung zwischen Harry und Albus. Wie man sich vorstellen kann, ist es nicht einfach, im Schatten vom legend\u00e4ren Harry Potter aufzuwachsen. Gerade f\u00fcr Albus, der wesentlich sensibler und nachdenklicher ist, als seine zwei Geschwister. Doch auch er muss seinen Weg finden, genauso wie Harry lernen muss, mit einem f\u00fcr ihn \"schwierigen\" Kind umzugehen. Ich fand die Konflikte sehr nachvollziehbar und es zeigt, dass Harry eben nicht die durchweg perfekte Hauptfigur ist. Gleichzeitig haben, wie versprochen, viele alte bekannte und auch neue Figuren ihren Auftritt. Ich fand es einfach herrlich. Dadurch, dass ein faszinierendes magisches Artefakt durchweg eine wichtige Rolle spielt, werden auch Schaupl\u00e4tze aufgesucht, die ich nur allzu sehr vermisst habe. Allerdings ist das gesamte Buch/St\u00fcck \u00fcberraschend d\u00fcster. Hier muss ich ganz ehrlich sagen, dass ich mit dieser Intensit\u00e4t nicht unbedingt gerechnet habe. Eigentlich h\u00e4tte ich es mir denken k\u00f6nnen, denn im Laufe der Reihe wurden die B\u00fccher von Band zu Band ernster und teils auch grausamer. \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" setzt diesen Trend fort. In vielen \"was w\u00e4re, wenn\" gibt es so einigen harten Tobak zu verdauen. Doch auch das passt zum mittlerweile erwachsenen Harry. Er ist eben keine 11 Jahre mehr alt und hat nun ganz andere Probleme, als fr\u00fcher. Dennoch spiegelt das St\u00fcck viele Elemente wieder, die alle Harry-Potter-B\u00e4nde ausmachen: Freundschaft, Mut der Verzweiflung und ein unersch\u00fctterbarer Zusammenhalt. Ganz ehrlich, am liebsten h\u00e4tte ich mir wieder alle B\u00e4nde geschnappt und zum x.-ten Mal wieder von vorne angefangen. Harry Potter ist zeitlos, es zu lesen macht mich gl\u00fccklich - es ist meine Portion Perfektion in Buchstabenform.Fazit ..................Ich bin mir sicher, dass man als Fan der Reihe wieder seinen Spa\u00df mit \"Harry Potter and the Cursed Child\" haben kann. Es ist vielleicht nicht ganz das, was sich viele erhofft haben (kein klassisches Buch). Aber es ist ein wundervoller Ausflug in eine Welt, die mir \u00fcber Jahre ans Herz gewachsen ist und mich ein St\u00fcck weit an meine Kindheit zur\u00fcckdenken l\u00e4sst. Im Vergleich zu unz\u00e4hligen B\u00fcchern, die mich dieses Jahr kaum fesseln konnten, klebte ich vom ersten Moment hier wieder an den Seiten. Harry Potter ist f\u00fcr mich reine Lesemagie - egal in welcher Form.Ein wundervoller Ausflug \"zur\u00fcck\""},

This book, actually screenplay, is one of the hardest I've ever had to review because I have so many mixed emotions on it. I gave it four stars, however, I don't think it deserved it entirely. I know that my rating is based in nostalgia. If I was basing my rating on plot, how solid the writing is and so forth - man  Harry Potter and The Cursed Child would easily go down to a two, yes two. I might be in the minority but I was one of the people who was not that excited about this release and did not think it was a good idea. Why didn't I think it was likely going to be a good idea? Mostly because I think sometimes we don't know when we've had enough of a good thing. When something is amazing and changes our lives, of course, we want MORE but that isn't always a great choice. The Harry Potter series is one of the most beloved book series of our generation and it ended on a high note, where we were left wondering and wanting to know more about these characters. I think that is where it should have ended, wanting more is a lot better than feeling \"meh\" or strange about a new book once you read it. This is not an original thought, many people have said it already, but this screenplay was VERY much a work of fanfiction. Ok, so what gives? How come I gave it a four stars if I have all this negative shit to say about it? Well, I still happened to get caught up in the story because I was loving seeing the characters again. It was like watching a bad sequel but you didn't care that it was kind of terrible, you were just so happy all the cast returned. The positives for me about Harry Potter and The Cursed Child were Scorpious, loved him. His and Albus's friendship was probably my favorite part of the book. I liked (view spoiler)[Voldermont's daughter plot line (hide spoiler)], even it was cheesy. I loved the ending where all the characters are really all together interacting once again, I completely fangirled out. The biggest negatives for me about the story had to be that I didn't feel that the story was true to the characters we loved and watched grow up. Harry was kind of a douche father, Hermione didn't have any of that sass, but heart that we all loved and Ron - oh where do I even start? They turned him into a total loser, just a joke. The relationship between Ron and Hermione felt like nothing, there was no chemistry. There really wasn't any chemistry between Harry, Ron and Hermione period. I also thought the Cedric story was a very flimsy one to go on. Overall, this is a story was fun if you aren't trying to over-analysis it. It is cheesy, it isn't going to change your world, but you just might be able to ignore all those glaring flaws just to go back to Hogwarts!       \u201cThe world changes and we change with it.

I want in it without knowing anything about it, even though spoilers were available everywhere, I've been a good kid and I resisted every temptations. Maybe that's what I did wrong.I published a post about the things you should know before reading it, you can find it HERE.Since It's hard to talk about the plot of the play without spoiling bits. I will just give you the start point of the story. The story picks up from Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows epilogue. Nineteen years after the Battle of Hogwarts our heroes, now grown up, are at platform 9 3/4 to send off their kids. From there the story skips forward to Albus, Harry's kid, forth year of school. The play concentrated itself on the relationship between father and son, Harry and Albus.I'm just going to give you some clues about the plot: Time-turner, Cedric, Triwizard Cup.Let me say I was really happy to see our heros back, some even from the dead, and was surprised with the new characters. I loved Scorpius Malfoy, he is a good mix of intelligence and humor, on the other hand Albus Potter felt obnoxious to me and as stupid as his father, sorry Harry.The plot was kind of boring and felt like a bad fanfiction from start to finish. After finishing the Harry Potter series we all said good byes to the characters or made up our own story, I would have like to see their kids in Hogwarts, playing quidditch, going to potion class and making some mischief, we don't get any of that again someone is messing with magic to bring back You-Know-Who.I think that most of my problem with this book was in fact that it isn't a book, but a play the only way to judge it honestly is to see it on stage.

Mi opini\u00f3n se resume de forma muy sencilla: me gusta pero no porque crea que es bueno, sino porque es de Harry Potter y todo lo que tenga que ver con Harry Potter me toca la fibra sensible. A fangirlear se ha dicho."},

I tend to just disregard it whenever it's brought up as \"That bonus fanfiction chapter Jo wrote and published.\"I do also read a lot of scripts! Old scripts, mind you. I'm a Shakespeare snob, took drama for six years, and have a thing for Greek drama. So the format of this book doesn't bother me in the least. But this is written in script format, so you know, if that bothers you....something to watch out for. On the above script format note...this isn't good script format. It's missing a lot of beats and scenery placement that left me wondering where everyone was. You know those things everyone makes fun of where it's like Hamlet: Word to your mother. (Hamlet exit left)? It's because it actually helps out a lot. Now maybe that is something that modern scripts are doing without, but I found it annoying. (view spoiler)[It was especially troublesome when the Golden Trio, Ginny, and Draco were all in the same room all of the sudden. Or the time traveling placement in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. (hide spoiler)]It is really nice to see all the characters we've come to love come back to life again. But to be honest...they get outshone big time by Albus and especially Scorpius. Scorpius is like a dorky Hermione with Draco's looks and it's amazing. Their friendship is also great and it's so nice to see friendship continue to play such an integral part of the Harry Potter world. From this point on, my review is going to get ranty and gif heavy. I apologize.First, some of the characters were really fucking out of character. To the point where it was nearly offensive. At 12%, we have Amos Diggory demanding Harry to turn over a Time Turner to get his son, Cedric, back. First, why was Amos waiting all this time? There's was an additional year after Cedric's death (until the Time Turners were destroyed) where he could have petitioned the Ministry for the Time Turner. Why is he suddenly waiting for it now? Second, why are you doing such a disservice to Amos's character like this? Of course he was upset over his son's death. What fucking parent wouldn't be? But the dialogue and the way it played out made it seem like Amos was less a father in mourning and more a petulant man wanting ice cream before he went to bed. (view spoiler)[And I understand if Delphi used a spell of some sort, but for all the things blatantly given to us in the script, to have this not be one of those things, just furthers the disservice to Amos. (hide spoiler)]Next, you've taken Ron, of the Golden Trio and turned him into comic relief and...dialogue space taker upper. Look, some fans don't like Ron because of some reason or another but Ron is Harry's Scorpius! Ron is less of Harry's Scorpius in this book than Draco!Which brings us to Draco. I liked him. He was a bit defanged, but I can understand why. Who I can't understand being defanged is McGonagall. Have you ever known Minerva McGonagall to take fucking orders from someone if they're orders she doesn't agree with? Like, yeah, she'll eventually have to comply if they're in a position of authority, but she will make sure her displeasure is known because she is Minerva fucking McGonagall. The thing between Harry and Dumbeldore's portrait was weird and forced. It was like reopening a scar that you had naturally let heal just to see if it would hurt again. Like yeah, of course it would, but now it's just a new wound. The rest are under spoiler tags:(view spoiler)[Are we supposed to believe that Hermione would become Snape 2.0 just because...why exactly? Because it sounds suspiciously like Hermione became Snape 2.0 because she was alone and literally nowhere in any of the books can I see any hint of that.Nowhere. But I'll double check. Cedric fucking Diggory becoming a murderer. Are you fucking kidding me? This. This was enough to drag it down an entire fucking star. Because no. The reason?He will murder someone because he's humiliated in front of the school. Yeah. Cedric Diggory. The guy you read about in The Goblet of Fire. That same guy. Yeah. Go reread that book. I'll wait. Come back and tell me that that fucking guy is capable of murdering someone just because he was humiliated one time in front of a lot of people. Tell me that his handsome face wouldn't be able to play it off. And lastly, and the winner of another whole star getting taken off this review; Voldemort. More importantly, the fact that Voldemort and Bellatrix have a kid together. It just seriously reads out of something a thirteen year old writes for bad fanfiction because they don't know how to create a compelling villain. Which is totally great for that thirteen year old because you need a base to start from. It's not okay for JK Rowling. Shall I point out some plot holes for this? Do I have time? First, Snape. Second, Malfoy.Third, the timeline just doesn't make fucking sense. Fourth, literally all of the inner circle is dead. How did magically the guardians of this kid not get killed?Fifth, how was Harry's scar not always hurting? There are more, but do you see where I'm going with this? (hide spoiler)]Next were the canon inconsistencies and I'll just say Time Turner. Because I don't know if anything about the Time Turner was not inconsistent with Harry Potter canon. It honestly just opens up a whole can of worms because like....why did no one go back in time and kill baby Tom Riddle?The fuck was up with Harry's scar? I mean, I know it had terrible rules in canon, but here it made even less sense. We can Transfigure into other people now with little to no prep?Albus and Scorpius seriously get around so easily. Like, they must have golden tickets into all the banned places. This goes with bad characterization, but after Hermione dealing with Snape's puzzle in The Sorcerer's Stone, what are the chances that she'd hide something with a riddle? Tell me. Look me in the eye and tel me that she'd hide something with a puzzle and not think to herself \"You know what, I outsmarted a smart professor's test. I should probably rethink this.\"The Ministry's security is fucking laughable. Remember Polyjuice Potion? Remember how it took two fucking months to brew? Yea, apparently it doesn't anymore. (view spoiler)[Snape just forgets he can use Legilimency. You know. When Scorpius shows up he just decides to take him at face value instead of interrogating him. Draco having a spare Time Turner makes sense and at the same time, no fucking sense. The blanket thing also makes some sense, but it's explained so shoddily and so rushed that you're only vaguely aware of it. This is also another point where the stage directions would have been nice because it just sounded like they went in where James and Lily where rocking Harry and it's like.....what the fuck? (hide spoiler)]The writing itself? Not great. This is a script so all the writing is dialogue and this dialogue is heavy handed telling. It's hard to get away from in a script, but it can be done beautifully. Do you know how I know that Scorpius and Albus are friends? The script comes out and tells me. It just says 'Hey, they share a meaningful look. Besties.' I don't see too many interactions that show me they are friends.The same could be said about Albus and Scorpius's disconnect from peers. We're told that it's happening rather than shown. Which is alright, but we're told only very briefly and in a montage type scene. This is pivotal knowledge for both these characters. You might want to show just one scene in the Great Hall. Now, for the bad telling and not showing, Harry and Albus's relationship is done well. There's a lot of exploration in that relationship and it's explored nicely. But for all the crimes the book makes, and it makes a few severe ones, perhaps its worst is that the story doesn't quite seem to know who it belongs to. Is this Scorpius and Albus's story? Or Albus and Harry's story? Or Harry and Voldemort's? Or even Harry and Draco's? It tries desperately to give us the nostalgia of the old books but because of the medium we're presented with, and the nature of the story, it's trying desperately to do too much in too little of a time. I really wanted to love this book. I liked it for a revisit into the world and I really enjoyed the new characters, but I disliked what they did with my old characters. It read too much like shoddy fanfiction. Now excuse me while I go find fanfiction of the new characters.

I\u2019m not saying anything about the plot or what happens to various characters, but just expressing my general feelings about the book, the story, and especially the characters, might give potential readers more information than they want to know prior to reading the play. I actually would have still enjoyed it if I\u2019d learned too much prior to reading it, but it was more entertaining to go in knowing little. I found this to be an incredibly quick read. I read Part 1, Acts 1 u0026amp; 2 one day and Part 2, Acts 3 u0026amp; 4 the next day. I\u2019d love to see the play, particularly with the original London cast, but reading the play was fun too. I had seen some still photos of the West End production and some details about the sets and cast that I occasionally thought of as I was reading. I\u2019ve always enjoyed reading plays though and don\u2019t absolutely need to see them, though I also find delight in plays I\u2019ve gotten to see as an audience member.I\u2019ve seen many 1 and 2 star ratings of this and I\u2019ve read comments from those who despised it and have many complaints about it. In fact, until I was starting it, and I learned that some people I know did love it or at least really liked it, I was not feeling enthusiastic. I went in with low expectations, figuring I love the seven book series so much that nothing could ruin it for me, that if I hated this, I could just look at it as fan fiction and put it out of my mind. Well, I loved it, and I found it enjoyable from the start. I\u2019ve gotten a couple comments from others who are shocked about that. And at this point I\u2019m really surprised by how many are unhappy with it. Even if I\u2019d heard nothing but good things about this play I\u2019d have greatly enjoyed it. I\u2019m eager to read reviews after I\u2019ve posted this one in the usual three places. I look forward to politely and respectfully chatting with other readers who have similar or different opinions about this play, whether they loved it, liked it, found it mediocre or didn\u2019t like it, or hated it.However, even though I think it\u2019s special in its own way, when I do rereads of the series I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll feel compelled to reread this book. I do own the hardcover and paperback editions of the seven books, plus the British edition and the illustrated edition of the first book. For this book I read a borrowed library copy. If the play comes to my city I\u2019ll try to see it. I had a lot of fun reading it. I\u2019m really happy that it was written and published.There are no significant spoilers here, but with an abundance of caution the rest of what I say will be in spoiler tags:(view spoiler)[As usual with Jo Rowling, as this play is based on a story written by her, a lot of wise and psychologically sophisticated things are said about relationships, people, life.There are smart and heartfelt messages about all sorts of things, including being able to go only forward, about getting over trauma, about everyone needing to receive and give support from and to others, about parenting and trying to be a good parent, about truly seeing and accepting others for who they really are, and about friendship and loyalty, and about how even though parents and children have similarities family (and history) aren\u2019t definite destiny, though I loved seeing the all too real similarities between members of different generations. It\u2019s about growing up. It\u2019s about not needing to be perfect, about the impossibility of perfection. I loved the mentions of the experience of being an orphan as they really resonated with me how they\u2019re never over even when childhood is over.I adored Scorpius and loved Albus, annoying teenager and all. I enjoyed getting reacquainted with characters I knew from the Harry Potter books and meeting the new characters, including members of the younger generation. It was lovely to see what happens to the original gang, in more than one scenario, and I felt that how everyone turned out made perfect sense. In the series, the Time Turner was a favorite part for me, and I enjoyed it having a huge role in this story. I appreciated all the humor, and there was a lot, especially because at times the story does get very dark. There was a lot of suspense throughout the story, and I did worry a fair amount about the fate of various characters and a couple in particular. It\u2019s one reason I zoomed through the story. I was so eager to see what would happen and how it would end. I also made sure to savor what I read. There were some good quotes, though I didn\u2019t officially \u201clike\u201d any of them. At some point I might. Maybe soon!!!A while back I read that J.K. Rowling said if viewers (and I assume readers) of the play don\u2019t cry at the end they have hearts of stone. I didn\u2019t cry but I was very touched.I didn\u2019t really look at the cover until after I\u2019d read the 3rd of 4 acts. It\u2019s intriguing.  (hide spoiler)]The following are some details of contents and might be considered spoilers by many, much more than the contents of the above spoiler tag:(view spoiler)[Scorpius seems to fit much better in Ravenclaw and maybe even Gryffindor and definitely not in Slytherin, and Albus also doesn\u2019t seem to fit in Slytherin but in Gryffindor. I don\u2019t think the reader is really told if Albus tried to sway the sorting hat about his assigned house.I do like how this story sort of starts where the epilogue of book 7 leaves off. It\u2019s obvious that the story is Rowling\u2019s vision and that she must have approved everything in it. I will say that I don\u2019t think the endings in this book and book 7 of the series are the strongest parts of the entire story. They\u2019re a tad anticlimactic, but I\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s the scope of the entire story that appeals to me.Near the beginning I was so hoping that the whole montage of the sorting and the early Hogwarts years was a dream or a fear and not really real. I was confused by a few things, including why the trolley witch refers to Sirius Black and his cronies Fred u0026amp; George Weasley when they\u2019re a generation apart. Other things I saw that bothered others didn\u2019t bother me, such as polyjuice potion being readily available and ready to use. After all, a good two decades have passed and there are bound to be changes such as possibly the ability to keep it preserved for later use and compelling reasons to always have some on hand.I was so worried as I read about the eventual fates of characters but I was never concerned that there wouldn\u2019t be a meaningful resolution, and once I started reading I knew that I would be entertained. The most common negative word I\u2019ve seen to describe the play is mess. I disagree. I don\u2019t have the patience to write a more perfect review so maybe this review is a bit of a mess but in my opinion the play is not. Not perfect but definitely good enough! Jo Rowling has said this is the last Harry Potter story and I hope that she sticks to that. Even though I\u2019m always curious to know more and more, I thought books 1-7 would be the final word and I was worried about even this story and play. I think it worked and I\u2019m grateful for all the books, but they\u2019re there to always dive back into and in my opinion we need no more. I feel this way even though from this book I took away some considerably worthwhile things to ponder and even though I had a blast reading it.

I loved the mentions of the experience of being an orphan as they really resonated with me how they\u2019re never over even when childhood is over.I adored Scorpius and loved Albus, annoying teenager and all. I enjoyed getting reacquainted with characters I knew from the Harry Potter books and meeting the new characters, including members of the younger generation. It was lovely to see what happens to the original gang, in more than one scenario, and I felt that how everyone turned out made perfect sense. In the series, the Time Turner was a favorite part for me, and I enjoyed it having a huge role in this story. I appreciated all the humor, and there was a lot, especially because at times the story does get very dark. There was a lot of suspense throughout the story, and I did worry a fair amount about the fate of various characters and a couple in particular. It\u2019s one reason I zoomed through the story. I was so eager to see what would happen and how it would end. I also made sure to savor what I read. There were some good quotes, though I didn\u2019t officially \u201clike\u201d any of them. At some point I might. Maybe soon!!!A while back I read that J.K. Rowling said if viewers (and I assume readers) of the play don\u2019t cry at the end they have hearts of stone. I didn\u2019t cry but I was very touched.I didn\u2019t really look at the cover until after I\u2019d read the 3rd of 4 acts. It\u2019s intriguing.  (hide spoiler)][Scorpius seems to fit much better in Ravenclaw and maybe even Gryffindor and definitely not in Slytherin, and Albus also doesn\u2019t seem to fit in Slytherin but in Gryffindor. I don\u2019t think the reader is really told if Albus tried to sway the sorting hat about his assigned house.I do like how this story sort of starts where the epilogue of book 7 leaves off. It\u2019s obvious that the story is Rowling\u2019s vision and that she must have approved everything in it. I will say that I don\u2019t think the endings in this book and book 7 of the series are the strongest parts of the entire story. They\u2019re a tad anticlimactic, but I\u2019m okay with that. It\u2019s the scope of the entire story that appeals to me.Near the beginning I was so hoping that the whole montage of the sorting and the early Hogwarts years was a dream or a fear and not really real. I was confused by a few things, including why the trolley witch refers to Sirius Black and his cronies Fred u0026amp; George Weasley when they\u2019re a generation apart. Other things I saw that bothered others didn\u2019t bother me, such as polyjuice potion being readily available and ready to use. After all, a good two decades have passed and there are bound to be changes such as possibly the ability to keep it preserved for later use and compelling reasons to always have some on hand.I was so worried as I read about the eventual fates of characters but I was never concerned that there wouldn\u2019t be a meaningful resolution, and once I started reading I knew that I would be entertained. The most common negative word I\u2019ve seen to describe the play is mess. I disagree. I don\u2019t have the patience to write a more perfect review so maybe this review is a bit of a mess but in my opinion the play is not. Not perfect but definitely good enough! Jo Rowling has said this is the last Harry Potter story and I hope that she sticks to that. Even though I\u2019m always curious to know more and more, I thought books 1-7 would be the final word and I was worried about even this story and play. I think it worked and I\u2019m grateful for all the books, but they\u2019re there to always dive back into and in my opinion we need no more. I feel this way even though from this book I took away some considerably worthwhile things to ponder and even though I had a blast reading it.  (hide spoiler)]"},

[Do keep in mind the author of the play is not JKR herself, in spite of her name on the cover]And it's not a very good next-gen movieverse fanfic, either. Among the common tropes it falls victim to, you can count:1) Hating/flanderizing Ron Weasley into little more than \"the fun guy who likes to eat\", a trope that was already poked fun at years ago by the likes of A Very Potter Musical.2) The others don't come off much better, since pretty much all three members of the Golden Trio have moments of utter unlikability.3) Focusing on the adults' angst even though the plot should be the kids' story. And when I say \"the adults' angst\" I don't mean that they have enduring trauma that survives to this day and plagues them in new ways. I mean the Golden Trio, Ginny, and Draco are all stuck with the same angst they had in the original books.4) Making the original cast's development inexistent. Didn't Harry learn that Slytherin House wasn't uniformly bad? Didn't he learn from Dumbledore to have honest relationships with children? Well, apparently not, because he ended up making those mistakes himself!5) Making the plot revolve entirely on the original books' plot. I guess Harryu0026amp;co.'s kids don't get to have a story of their own\u2014it's all about their parents' story. And I don't mean that lightly, the plot literally is all about the original books. Which brings us to\u20266) Time travel. It's one of many ways in which this play's canon outright breaks the original books' canon. And it's a major fixture.7) Mary Sue, thy name is Delphi. I mean\u2026seriously. How many fics are there where a cool and mysterious girl is revealed to be Voldemort's daughter, and she has all his awesome power? She even has hair that's described as \"silver and blue\"! Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way would either be BFFs or archenemies with her and there is no middle ground.Here, I think 7 is a good number for some reason, so I'll stop. There's plenty more to be angry about, though. Like\u2026Luna who? Because she's not in this. Like\u2026trying to make Severus Snape redeemable again. We've been through this, book, even if he was a double agent, he was still abusive to fucking children for\u2026like, fifteen years or so. Which was completely unrelated. Like\u2026the most fucking convoluted resolution to the climax. Like\u2026look, just read my full reviews if you want details.Some positive highlights: Minerva McGonagall. Wait, did I say highlights plural? I mean that's about it.I should talk about the new kids. In the end we really focus on three: Albus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy, and Rose Granger-Weasley. And really only the former two, which is probably for the best, because Rose is kind of the worst throughout the play. Meanwhile Albus and Scorpius range from \"adorable nerds\" to \"oh my god please stop and think about what you're doing already\". Also, the shipper in me feels obliged to say that yes, there's plenty of subtext between them. And it is also instantly ruined by Scorpius's very forced crush on Rose and Albus's even worse crush on the actual villain of the book, a woman in her twenties who doesn't mind flirting back if it gets her to manipulate him. It's just\u2026so wrong. And no, I didn't expect Scorpius/Albus to become canon, but at least the book could have done a better job at giving us alternatives. Instead of making Rose so unlikable, how about making another Golden Trio? It would have been perfectly feasible, but instead we got\u2026this.Well anyway. That's Cursed Child. Dear J.K. Rowling:"},

I am talking about \u201cthe moment you learnt that My So-called Life got cancelled\u201d levels of disappointment here and we all know how much we adored Angela Chase and Jordan Catalano (even though he was supremely cad-like). I was sorely disappointed, yes but I wouldn\u2019t have a clear conscience if I didn\u2019t confess that I loved it, too. O, the quandary!Like many people of my generation, I grew up alongside with Harry, Ron, and Hermione and picking up this book made me feel like my 11-year old self again-all bright-eyed and innocent-hardly able to put down the newest instalment in the series until she had read it cover to cover. I was drowning in thick syrupy nostalgia. And this is one of the biggest reasons why I can\u2019t bring myself to completely hate this book (despite its many shortcomings/plotholes) because it made me feel things only a few books have been able to make me feel. And that is a big deal for me.My biggest complaint was the format. I know, a play doesn\u2019t translate perfectly well on the page and watching the story being brought to life would be a magical experience in itself altogether but, I just can\u2019t. The conversations were stilted/unnatural and the characters felt like the watered-down versions of their former selves. Where did things go wrong? What happened to the affable trio I loved and grew up with? It feels like a shot to the heart to admit that the script read like one of the many fanfictions I have read over the years. ;____;There were a few hidden gems, though. I liked Draco and his son, Scorpius. Albus was okay, but everything was so fast that going back to Hogwarts didn\u2019t feel as if I was going back home. And Dumbledore, oh.  \u201cHarry, there is never a perfect answer in this messy, emotional world. Perfection is beyond the reach of humankind, beyond the reach of magic. In every shining moment of happiness is that drop of poison: the knowledge that pain will come again. Be honest to those you love, show your pain. To suffer is as human as to breathe.\u201d That man. u0026lt;3To reiterate, I suppose it\u2019s a little unfair of me to judge it because it was a script but it was sort of okay and I missed Rowling\u2019s writing."},

Never been a fan of these books but at least they had internal consistency up to a certain degree...until now. If you choose to consider the CC as canonical, then you agree that everything in that universe is absurd and has absolutely no rules or logic. Rowling has her name plastered all over the cover of the book, so even if she hasn't written part of it (or just the basic plot), she's still given her stamp of approval on it. Has she not read it? Are we supposed to think that she doesn't know what it contains? Absolutely not! She has been following the play's entire process very closely, as documented in the promo videos of the CC that we've seen so far.What is more, the ridiculous defensive argument that it's \"supposed to be a play! That's why it's different!\" is merely moronic, because the script's critics (like myself) have no problem with the format. We have read many scripts in our lives that are considered masterpieces, like Euripides's tragedies. It is not required to watch the play (and I personally have never seen a tragedy on stage) to appreciate the mastery of these creations. In no way am I comparing these global and eternal plays of greatness to this shitty fanfiction. I have read many fanfictions that were better written than this. To publish such a kind of crappy fanfic as an official work and charge it for 30 pounds is frankly insulting. The readers' rage is completely justified."},

So, of course it goes by pretty quickly and we wrap things up in 300 pages of pure dialogue, instead of 300-800 pages of dialogue and description and background and thoughts. It kind of reminds me of the stories Rowling puts on Pottermore, except I rank this one much higher with more weight behind it because it is officially published in book format and because it's going to be a production.
