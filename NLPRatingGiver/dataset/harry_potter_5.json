Every book gets bigger and bigger, this is unbelievably dark and so different than any other book. Reading the first book I never would have guessed how it all takes such a dark turn or that it'd come to this. This book is the epitome of plot twists.The tyranny of Dolores Umbridge. The hunt. The ministry. The fight. The tension between everything and everyone. The suspense was real, I felt it in my bones every time something would happen or someone would get hurt. Near-death experiences. Harry and Voldemort. The fight in the ministry between Voldemort and Dumbledore is one of the most amazing scenes I've ever read. It was breath-taking in all of its aspects. Whichever way you want to see this, it was incredible. I loved and hated the fact that our heroes are being through so much pain. Not just Harry, or Ron & Hermione. I'm talking about every one. Event those in the Order of the Phoenix and those in Dumbledore's Army (coolest names ever, right?). Mrs. Rowling makes a leap every time, she takes every book to an entire different level. Thanks for reading my review! "},

I enjoy comedic, childlike humor as much as the rest of the fans, but to me when the story gets a little darker (deeper), it gets even better. We get a return of favorite characters, but as with the other books, we also get new ones. While the rest of the series introduced new characters that were fun and that we actually wanted to read about, here it just seems like two main hate-filled creatures show up: Dolores Umbridge (shudder) and Bellatrix (who I can't stand.)Harry is now 15 and showing it through teenage angst and mood swings. Happily this didn't bother me because - let's face it - these are dark times in the young wizard's life and him being happy-go-lucky would just be unrealistic. Plus the teenager hormones were already tweaked anyway because of his friends, Dumbledore, and the wizarding community basically ignoring him for a summer. Then you have the Voldemort strange triangle in his head, probably fueling that anger. I noticed when watching the movie that they played up the potential possession while in the book it was hinted as a possibility, left for the reader to muse about themselves and see what happens.Hermione and Ron show considerable patience with their temper-triggered friend, becoming of all things, perfects in the school. It was an ironic touch for the series but would have worked just as well without it. Loony Luna is a delight because the girl is simply so strange, although the convenience of her character's connected to a newspaper owning father comes into play as well. There's Fred and George, who I always loved in the books but who seem lusterless in the movies - here they rocked with their unique style of misbehavior, especially when showing up a certain new villain.Where this book shines character-wise is Neville, who is so awesome as a friend suddenly and co-fighter. There's a teary situation in the hospital, and how he stands by Harry (stuffed nose and all) in a fight later was heart-winning. Dumbledore finally gets to show us why he has such an awesome, badass reputation in the wizarding world, and I couldn't be happier with the two scenes that showed him flexing the magic muscle.U+201CYou know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts...but you cannot deny he's got style...U+201D Since Snape is a favorite of mine but only shows his face occasionally, it was a further delight that Harry had to learn Occlumency from the professor. The scenes were intense and, although a small subplot, mesmerized me. They showed a glimpse into the life of Harry's parents before he put them on a pedestal.Can we all agree that McGonagall is even more likable after this book? I didn't care about her the first few, but she keeps growing on me. Here she's amazing. Sirius...ah, Sirius. This book shows even further that he is dependent upon Harry because he misses James so much and sees the father in the son. There was a sad scene in the fire where he withdraws from Harry a bit because he's disappointed. He spends much of the book frustrated and lonely, which was realistic and deep but depressing. I love their relationship, both without families but connecting to each other due to that.Let's wave aside the villain of Voldemort for this book, shall we? He's there, he's bad, but he's not that frequent and he isn't the one who really irritated readers in this one. Those badges go to the annoying Umbridge we all loved to hate and the evil Bellatrix. Umbridge is around for the majority of book, raising shivers of annoyance. Besides her arrogant attitude that made me want to slap her, there's the beyond disturbing punishment with that blood quill and poor Harry. It certainly brought a twisted touch to the series that was almost missing before.I hate to see Harry tricked at the end, but you can't keep a series real and have the character be perfect in predictions every time. The book misses that perfect finish line because there are too many lucky coincidences that come in handy and save the characters throughout fight scenes, but they were still imaginative and adventurous. It's a large book, 870 pages, and if you stand back and examine it, not a lot of action actually happens. Still, it's so easy to get sucked in and so hard to look away. There's a heartbreaking, soul-slapping death that I don't think I'll get over. I knew it was coming, but couldn't remember the order from the movies when it would show up. Sadness! It was sudden and shocking and just awful. Harry's emotion afterwards was realistic and well done.J.K. Rowling continues this series with talent, and the books really do keep getting better and better. A timeless series that should continue to bewitch future generations."},

I was more than content to just watch the movie if I eve needed my OotP fix. Flash forward to last year, where I stopped my HP reread because I knew OotP wasn't going to be as good. Then flash forward to last week when I was feeling slumpish after a few sub-par books and needed something to get my fix. Why not continue with the Harry Potter reread? Of course OotP was next, but even this novel is still good right?Wrong.It's phenomenal. Now that I'm an adult, I can truly appreciate the characterization of Harry Potter in this novel. Just two months ago he witnessed a man he called friend be brutally murdered by the man who betrayed his parents. Betrayed his parents to the man who killed them, and who would later that night, be resurrected. Harry isn't a brat in this novel. He's a 15 year old kid suffering from PTSD. He's a 15 year old kid who's been hoisted into these incredibly adult situations that no one his age should ever have to prepare for. He's a 15 year old kids who's spent years finding adults he believed he could trust wholeheartedly, and it seems at every turn he's being abandoned, ignored, or made out to be some attention seeking brat by his own government. This also happens to be the year that Harry comes to understand that Dumbledore isn't the 'perfect' man he's come to idolize. He has his flaws, he keeps things hidden from Harry that Harry needs to know, he even fully admits at the end to playing a part in the death of Sirius Black. An accidental part, but a part nonetheless. It's a hard lesson I think we all had to go through, but an important one. Dumbledore isn't perfect, no one is. It's sad. Brutally sad. And also as an adult, I can now fully understand everything going on in this novel. This novel confused me as a child, but now that I can read with a mature and somewhat fresh mind, I can understand everything that goes on here. From the workings of the Ministry, to the prophecy at the end. I'm not sure how I could ever consider this to be my least favorite of the Harry Potter novels. I've said in an update that I think I'd place this just behind Goblet of Fire, which is my favorite. But I really think that this novel may be my favorite now. For so long Goblet of Fire was the turning point for me. People actually died, Voldemort actually came back, the Death Eaters returned, and not even Hogwarts felt safe. But I actually think this is a greater turning point for the series.The death of Sirius Black, the reign of Dolores Umbridge, the O.W.L.s, the duel in the Ministry, the widely regarded return of the Dark Lord, and the realization that Dumbledore isn't the man we thought he was. It's all so sad, and so telling of what will come next. Unfortunately I've got a few more books to get through before I can return to the Wizarding World, but 'The Half-Blood Price' is high up on my 'to read soon' list!"},

In fact, it was worse because you know you can't do anything, and you're actually expecting the bad things to happen.But the thing is, the first time I read these books, I only liked them; I wasn't attached to neither the story nor the characters - I simply enjoyed them. All that changed with this reread, in which I found myself surprisingly immersed in them and I was a victim of what most book-lovers suffer: Caring about them.Oh yes, Dumbledore is right: Pain makes me human. At least I can say that the fact that I feel hurt after finishing this book is a clear sign of a talented author, since it is so rare that I mourn book characters as if they were real.So what makes this book better than the others? It's mainly the fantastic character development, and of course, the complexity of the storyline, which was now full with politics and many more dark moments.The Boy Who Lived... He has grown a lot, hasn't he? And his sufferings have grown with him too. Now not only are his parents dead, but the one person he cared about the most is too.Which brings me again as to why it was worse knowing it would happen. Because Sirius Black had been one of my favourite characters so far. In fact, it's probable that his death hurt more because I commited a great mistake called \"relating to the characters,\" or better said, \"finding yourself in parts of them.\"Yeah, I related to Sirius. His personality is not similar to mine, but the feelings and experiences he underwent in his youth are. And again, there's the fact that he was Harry's last family. Oh no, there we go again...Anyway, the last thing I can say is that at least everything in this series happens for a reason, and not because the author only wants some tears shed. Now I can only prepare myself for the many more depressing deaths (of the rest of my favourite characters *weeps*) that are coming.Off to reread book 6, then!P.S.: I didn't want this review to be ramblings about how sad this book is. I wanted to praise the characters, the writing, the world-building and also say why everything had to be this way, but... well, I decided to go on the... easier way, I guess.P.P.S.: It's been more than 24 hours since I finished this, and I've already started book 6, but damn, it still hurts. I didn't remember to be this affected before."},

Somewhere in the middle of all this is this chick named Umbridge who is really good at being insufferable. You know she's going to get hers in the end because this is a Harry Potter book, so it's no surprise when she gets her comeuppance. At this point, I would have much rather seen her take over the school permanently and the students continuing their education in a fucking cave... or something else unpredictable. I was so ready for something different that I cheered when a main character died. I almost gave this an extra star because Rowling killed off this character, but I changed my mind. That one scene doesn't make up for the rest of this tedious attempt to fulfill her promise of a seven book series.In summation: If it wasn't for my goddamned OCD I would never have finished this.

Rowling did her best to pack a lot into this one and it feels too bulgy. If this was carry-on luggage, TSA would make her check it for going over the size limit. Dolores Umbridge - What a great evil character she is, isn't she? Quite the bitch. And the kicker is she's supposed to be on the good side! I like a well-crafted, dual-natured character as much as the next reader, but I do not like when characters are made to be so blind to what's going on that it's beyond belief. Umbridge's absolute unwillingness to believe in the return of Voldemort is trying to say the least. She's Hitler-esque at times. That's fine, a little over the top, but fine. But she cares sooo very much for the Ministry of Magic and Hogwarts, or at least in her position there, that one would expect her to do her due diligence in investigating any threat to her own power and interests.Sirius Black - Now, this one's on me. I LOVE Sirius Black and I really wanted to see the development of a strong bond between he and Harry. Since book three I'd been waiting for some Black/Potter tag team action. I wanted to see them hanging out, doing Uncle/Nephew kind of things. That's not quite how it played out. Oh well... It's nobody's fault but mine that I let this missing aspect get me down. Still, a book review is subjective and so I must admit a personal bias that affected my overall enjoyment.Harry's Yellow Fever - That's so racist! Okay, now that I've got that out of the way... I was disappointed when Harry's love affair with Cho Chang went south. I liked the relationship. It was complicated. It was difficult for him. It could have made for a fine romance. But no, Rowling had other ideas - very British ideas, like \"keeping it in the family\". Frankly, Harry's eventual attachment to Ginny Weasley felt too close. I mean, Harry and her feel almost like brother and sister. Plus she's a ginger. Eeeewww.I could give Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix four or even five stars and there are reasons I might drop it as low as two.

I love how Harry and the crew are dealing with more adult issues now, such as relationships and death.

Sure, there were some tough parts earlier on, and while it's true that some darkness crept into the ending of the previous installment, for the most part, that was a pretty happy book compared to this. Ron got over his jealousy, the school eventually got behind Harry as a Champion, and good still triumphed over evil. Our hero surmounted impossible odds in the Triwizard Tournament and then managed to escape Voldemort, yet again, and warn the wizarding world of his return. And then BAM!The beginning of this book hits you in the face. Where you expect Harry to be in the know, heU+2019s in the dark, where you expect The Daily Prophet to be filled with stories about the ministry pursuing Voldemort, thereU+2019s only silence, where you expect excitement about returning to Hogwarts there is only frustration and angst. And you know what? You get it, you frigging get it, man. Because you were with Harry when he faced Voldemort and his Death Eaters alone, you stood beside him as the shades of his parents appeared from the tip of his enemyU+2019s wand and helped save his life. And when he made it back to safety, you were just as dumbfounded as he was when the minister of magic refused to believe him, refused to believe Dumbledore. So how dare they? How dare they let him rot, alone, in a house full of people who hate and ridicule him, while the murderer of his parents begins to rebuild his army? How dare they feed him snippets like U+201CWe canU+2019t tell you anything about what weU+2019ve been doing, and weU+2019ve been doing A LOT. But donU+2019t worry, weU+2019ll see you soon, we just canU+2019t tell you whenU+201D? As if he hasnU+2019t been through enough. If anyone has the right to know whatU+2019s going on, itU+2019s Harry. DoesnU+2019t anyone KNOW him like we do? Or do they just think that they know whatU+2019s best for him better than he does? And thatU+2019s part of the genius of this installment. This book grows up. Where the previous four could be labeled as childrenU+2019s stories, this one cannot. There are so many hard lessons and difficult themes in this, ones that a childU+2019s mind cannot fully grasp. Gone are the heroes, gone are the happy endings. This book teaches you that adults arenU+2019t the perfect protectors you thought they were. Sirius isnU+2019t infallible. James Potter isnU+2019t infallible. Albus frigging Dumbledore isnU+2019t infallible. None of them are. None of them are even fully good. And come to find out, those you thought were fully evil might not be either. This book introduces you to shades of grey, and each revelation seems to hit you harder than the last. Normally, I hate angst. This is mostly because I find the vast majority of what I see these days to be a sorry excuse to lengthen a story or a shoddy attempt to distract a reader from glaring issues. Trying to cover up weak characterization? Add some angst! Want to hide those holes in your plot? Add some angst! The only type of angst I can stand is believable angst. Rowling delivers on this. And thatU+2019s one of the many reasons that I love this book. There are a lot of other reasons, Fred and GeorgeU+2019s badassery, Ginny Weasley finding her voice and becoming a character in her own right, the undiluted rage that coursed through my body every time I read a scene that included Delores Umbridge, the incredible courage and honesty of Hermione Granger, the loyalty of Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom coming into his own, the failed Occlumency lessons (I WILL ALWAYS HATE SNAPE) and the way the entire school ended up doing exactly what the sorting hat suggested at the beginning of the year and banded together as one against the ministryU+2019s interference. I even loved the ending. YES, I SAID IT! And do you know why? Because life isnU+2019t sunshine and roses and you donU+2019t always get to say goodbye to those you love. You donU+2019t get the sense that SiriusU+2019s death was a righteous one. You donU+2019t get resolution. He didnU+2019t make some grand sacrifice to save the lives of many others. He died taunting the bad guys, smiling at them, egging them on as though he was still that ego-inflated teenager you glimpsed through the pensieve. And then you find out that it was all for nothing. That there were so many ways that it could have been avoided. How do you deal with that? The best you can, I guess. So while I donU+2019t necessarily \"enjoy\" this book as much as I do the others, it remains my favorite in the series for the reasons I listed above.This review can also be found on The Book Eaters."},

It's mainly due to the fact that I hate Umbridge more than words can translate, and having to read about her so much just infuriates me, rather than giving me warm fuzzies the entire time I'm reading.That being said, here are some of my thoughts on the book:-mention of Regulus Black near the beginning of this book. I've noticed particularly during this re-read that J.K. Rowling tends to mention characters a book or two before they will have any importance to the story. She seriously knew what she was doing while writing these books.-it's so weird to think that Sirius is related to Narcissa and Bellatrix! Sirius is such an amazing human, and he was born into a terrible family, which is pretty true of a lot of people. Just because you come from something/somewhere terrible, that doesn't mean you can't be different and be good.-Ron and Hermione becoming prefects is just so great. Surely there would be a better candidate in their year to be the male prefect, yet Dumbledore chose Ron. Why? Because Dumbledore knows that Ron always feels worthless in comparison to his five older brothers, and him becoming prefect was enough to make him feel like a winner at something. Dumbledore is cool like that.-Quite often I forget that St. Mungo's exists since it's not in the movies at all. Here, we get to see Neville's parents, as well as Gilderoy Lockhart (who is adorable now and not at all annoying), and I WISH THAT WAS IN THE MOVIES.-it sucks that Harry was banned from playing Quidditch this year, as I LOVE Quidditch. and Harry was so sad because of it, which made him cranky and quite insane. HOWEVER, I love that Ginny took over for him as Seeker. I feel like Ginny has grown up so much already, and it's particularly in this book that I grew to really like her. She's so much better in the books than in the movies.-In the epic fight near the end of the book, NEVILLE IS SO BADASS. If you ever think that Neville isn't brave until the last book, you are wrong. He was throwing himself at Death Eaters and Stunning the shit out of everybody. It was awesome.-As usual, lots of information was revealed in the last couple of chapters of the book. This particular book reveals A LOT of stuff that most people were probably wondering about whilst reading the other four books, as well as information that you probably didn't even think of. I love how many answers we get in this one.I THINK THAT'S IT FOR NOW. I have a lot of feelings, so I might add more later."},

Edit #1: 83U+2014It has been four months that I posted this review. And so far I have received great feedback. Thank you everyone for yo#ur support ^^ Remember, this is not a benign cause. 6/11/2013I know that I have neglected the subject of the new Goodreads policy a lot recently, and I ought not to have done that. You see, I wasnU+2019t very free recently, and well because I didnU+2019t know what to either say or on what book should I post it. And then I read this book, and the rebelliousness in this book made me think that hey, this book is perfect for what I have in mind. Oh, and guess what! I am going to be aggressive. Let me tell you something maybe a lot of you people are not aware of. We, people who live in the Middle East, look up towards the west, where presumably, everyone is free to say and do whatever they want, bounded by no tradition or religious law whatsoever. But when this kind of law is forced upon everyone from the west itself, we lose hope. We lose hope that anything will be good again. And well for someone (me), who has suffered a lot because of that (Facebook only made my freedom of speech more restricted), I found a haven for myself in Goodreads, where apparently no one gives a damn whether you insult or disagree with them because well, they donU+2019t care. And because they are mature enough to ignore any insults under the pretext that it is U+201Cyour opinionU+201D.Do you know how much I love that? I have suffered A LOT because of that. Let me tell you something about myself. I never EVER stay quiet about something that I believe to be true U+2013 even if I was wrong to many other people U+2013 and now Mister Money-Head-Of-Amazon has to ruin that for me. All right, I realized that everything that was said about the new policy was said in the utmost civilized way. But guess what! I am a teenager. I donU+2019t give a damn about manners, and I am about to say what everyone has wanted to say for a long time. Goodreads by succumbing to the green papers have restricted my freedom of speech. In the last few years, I have been bullied, put down, humiliated, insulted, punishedU+2026 just because I wanted to say what I had in mind, just because I always stand up to what I believe in. And since because ALL OF THAT HAPPENED TO ME, I turned towards Goodreads where I was surprised that no one cared about whatever I said, and always respected me when I wanted to express myself. No review of mine has been removed, but a lot of peopleU+2019s reviews have been removed. Since it didnU+2019t affect me yet, I should shut up, right? No! Just the fact that it exists is bothering me. It is like having this law around forbidding people to eat chicken, and I hate chicken, but that doesnU+2019t mean I should keep quiet. Okay, that was a bad example, but the closest I had to the ridiculousness of what we are fighting for. No one should fight for his right to express himself freely. It is a right. We are born with that right. And no number of reviews removed is going to change that. It is not going to frighten us. It is not going to make us back out. You can remove all the reviews you want, Goodreads, but this is something I believe in. So I am fighting, even if you have to ban me. Well, according to your own policy, you can't do that. Well, you can't even remove the reviews that have been put  before  the declaration of that censorship but you do it anyway. So you are bunch of hypocrites. You, Goodreads managers, anyone with the IQ of a peacock can realize that what you have done is so wrong on so many levels. If I were the Goodreads manager, I would say this to the Amazon Manager when he came offering the new law U+201CYou can take your money and your pathetic ass out of my office! You cannot threaten us with money or hold it over our heads! This company has so far made you millions of money just by existing and promoting your books! More than half of our members buy regularly from your website! In fact, according to this logic, you owe us!U+201D GR Manager slaps Amazon Manager. Jackie Shan bursts into the scene wearing nothing but a newspaper around his waist. Kung fu! Jackie kicks Amazon ManagerU+2019s head off, and his body goes around looking for its head. Meanwhile, GR Manager holds both the head and the body and throws them from the window of the headquarters. BOOM! The end. This policy is so wrong. If people like us cannot express themselves online, then where will they? I might not insult your precious little authors, Amazon Manager (in my opinion they shouldnU+2019t be called authors if they canU+2019t take god damn criticism. Not everyone should approve with them), but I have every god damn right to express myself freely without having to worry whether my review would be removed or not. The management even has no right to go around reading whatever we say online because well, I thought they had better things to do. It turns out I was wrong, donU+2019t you think? Anyway, what we say online is OUR concern, not yours. You shouldnU+2019t threaten us. You shouldnU+2019t condemn us. Maybe to you, you are only deleting a review, but to us you are restricting our freedom. And no one really appreciates freedom but the ones who have been deprived from it. I wonder how the Goodreads Management even agreed to this. I had a lot more to say about this on my mind, but I think I have made my point quite clearly.

And whilst this was acceptable in the earlier books where there was an element of the comical in his attempts to be evil, by book 5, where the themes have become signifantly darker, he and his side-kicks' unchanging and inane attempts to foil Harry's ultimate fate have just become annoying. The only saving grace is that Harry has more than enough true and worthwhile enemies and obstacles for the reader to really get bogged down by Malfoy's silliness. - the laudable themes of power/corruption/propaganda/censorship are played out with such naive characterisations, extreme situations and melodramaticism that it results in inflammatory knee-jerk reactions rather than furthering understanding of the subleties of these ideas. - the plot seems confused, as if JK Rowling has all these ideas, but is unsure of where she ultimately wants to go, thereby leaving in all these subplots that neither has entertainment, wisdom nor story-advancing value. EG what's with Grawp and the freaking giants??Overall- read it only as a part of the greater goal of coming closer to the ending of the series."},

I supposed to post the review yesterday but there was a blackout while I was reviewing and you can imagine how pissed I was when suddenly my computer was off and the review was already quite long. I was like this : well, I wasn't screaming because it was midnight but I was really really angry. well let's talk about this book :D *breaths in Breaths out* there were lots of tears, laugh, sadness, happiness and anger while I was reading it and I'm here still can't accept the death of the guy I cared care. I mean, why do I always lose charcters that I love or care?!?! why Sirius?! not Kreacher or anyone, anyone means Cho Chang actually...okay let's begin with Cho Chang.   I Ship Harry With Ginny Not Cho ChangI totally HATE this girl. She is a cry baby and she is also weird. one minute she is happy and then suddenly she bursts into tears and she always exaggerate problems. little problem can be big problem with her and I still don't know why Harry had feelings to her. yes, had. because he doesn't like Cho Chang anymore. YAY! finally he opened his eyes! and these scenes made me hate her so much :  U+279C He turned to saw Cho standing in the middle of the room, tears pouring down her face. U+279C 'I thought,' she said, tears spattering down on to the table, 'I thought you'd u - u - understand! I need to talk about it! Surely you n - need to talk about it t - too! I mean, you saw it happen, d - didn't you?' U+279C 'I'll see you around, Harry,' she said dramatically , and hiccoughing slightly she dashed to the door, wrenched it open and hurried off into the pouring rain.U+279C 'I'm really, really sorry. That interview was so brave ... it made me cry.' U+279C 'That was a really horrible trick of Hermione Granger's,' said Chp fiercely. 'She should have told us she'd jinxed that list -''I think it was brilliant idea,' said harry coldly, Cho flushed and her eyes grew brighter.'Oh yes, I forgot - of course, if it was darling Hermione's idea -''Don't start crying again,' said Harry warningly.'I wasn't going to! she shouted.'Yeah ... well ... good,' he said. 'I've got enough to cop with at the moment.''Go and cope with it then!' Cho said furiously, turning on her heel and stalking off. U+279C 'Yeah,' said Ron slowly, savouring the words, 'we won. Did you see the look on Cho's face when Ginny got the snitch right out from under her nose?''I suppose she cried, did she?' said Harry bitterly,'Well, yeah - more out of temper than anything, though ...' Ron frowned slightly. 'But you saw her chuck her broom away when she got back to the ground, didn't you?' and she was totally insane, why did she have to ask about Cedric to Harry while they were dating. of course Harry didn't want to talk abou Cedric! and Didn't she have feelings?! I'm sure Harry didn't want to remember that horrible memory. I ship Harry with Ginny because : U+2764 Ginny is funny U+2764 Ginny is not a crybaby U+2764 Ginny is brave U+2764 Ginny is more beautiful than ChoU+2764 She is basically more perfect than Cho   I Don't Like Harry's Temper I know, Harry was having a hard time but that didn't mean he had the rights to be harsh to his best friends. they will always on his side and there was a scene where he snapped at Hermione. 'Been having a nice little chat with her about whether or not I'm a lying, attention-seeking prat, have you?' Harry said loudly.'No,' said Hermione calmly. 'I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down our throats, Harry, because in case you haven't noticed, Ron and I are on your side.'There was a short pause.'Sorry,' said Harry in a low voice.'That's quite all right,' said Hermione with dignity. Then she shook her head. 'Don't you remember what Dumbledore said at the last end-of-term feast?' and they continued talking.oh! I also didn't like Harry when he shouted at professor Dumbledore because he just saved his life and he's clearly older than Harry, So Harry had to talk calmly to him even though he was angry and the most annoying thing was that he destroyed Dumbledore's possessions. he was totally rudeI know, I know he was sad because Sirius just died and I was sad too! I cried a lot! but I didn't angry with Dumbledore. I was angry with Kreacher, Bellatrix and Voldemort. I still am, actually. how could I forgive them?! they killed Sirius!   I Love Sirius Especially Young SiriusWith another shock of excitement, Harry saw Sirius give James the thumbs-up. Sirius was lounging in his chair at ease, tilting it back on two legs. He was very good-looking; his dark hair fell into his eyes with a sort of casual elegance neither James's nor Harry's could ever have achieved, and a girl sitting behind him was eyeing him hopefully, though he didn't seem to have noticed.OH.MY.GOD. HE IS SO HANDSOME. BUT WHY!?! WHY DID HE HAVE TO DIE?!?! I LIKE SIRIUS SO MUCH!! AND NOW, I WILL NEVER SEE HIM ANYMORE! LIFE IS SO UNFAIR. thank you for reading and liking this review, guys! hope you guys have a great day! U+2764 U+2764P.S. I like Luna so much! she is funny xD"},

It went by so slow and I felt like too much went on but at the same time nothing really happened. This book could've easily been made at least 200 pages shorter if J.K. Rowling got rid of all the pointless details and chapters that added nothing significant to the storyline. The movie was never really one of my favorites either and that was probably the primary reason it took me more than a month to get through Order of the Phoenix.On top of that, I wasn't a big fan of Harry in this book. I understand that he went through a whole lot after the events of Goblet of Fire but he was moody and a jerk to everyone around him 98% of the time and although I can empathize with him, it became too over the top for me and I got tired of it real fast. He just kept snapping and going off on all the wrong people and it got really annoying. All the constant CAPITALIZED yelling didn't help too much either.Even though Order of the Phoenix was my least favorite movie and book, I LOVED the concept of Dumbledore's Army. I just loved seeing all the students in action and actually putting everything they learned into good use. We finally get to meet Luna Lovegood, one of my favorite Harry Potter characters of all time, and I was so ecstatic every time her name was mentioned.As for Umbridge, she was also the ultimate villain in this book. She was the woman you LOVED to HATE and I felt the movie nailed this portrayal so perfectly. If J.K. Rowling's goal was to make you want to rip your own hair to shreds, she succeeded that and more.Overall, I felt the book was unnecessarily long but the movie itself was not much better. Where the book felt too slow, the film adaptation felt too rushed leaving out key details. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will probably always be my least favorite book and movie in the series, but the worst Harry Potter book is still a whole league better than a lot of other books."},

I loved to see the good guys being together and figthing the Dark Lord. I was so excited about this book anyway.I have a feeling that Harry in this book is not like Harry, the one I know, he throws a tantrum when his friends don't believe about what happened last year. I understand about his age making him not stable, if I can call it. The only person I want to talk about is Professor Umbrige, I call her the pink toad, she's the character that unify everything around this book impeccably. Seeing everyone fighting with her and restraining her not to destroy the Hogwart's system make this book unique unlike the first four books. I couldn't stop laughing then.

There's not only happiness in your life, you have to face so many regrets and learn how to move on like Harry and his friends.

I haven't read the last two installments yet, but from what I have read so far ... this one was my favorite. I enjoyed two other books in the series more than this one (The Sorcerer's Stone and The Goblet of Fire), but enjoyment is not necessarily the only aspect allowing a book to turn into a favorite.Let's go on the dark side here. While the previous books were still light-hearted in the overall atmosphere in spite of certain parts of the storylines, this one consisted to approximately 95% of darkness and a lack of happiness for all the characters involved. Studying at Hogwarts is not enjoyable anymore, life has become dangerous for everyone everywhere, favorite teachers have been replaced by unlikeable ones, dangers and traps are looming wherever you set your feet. Life is not easy for Harry Potter and his friends in this book, because not only do the dangers floating above their heads cloud their moods - they also slowly enter puberty with all the feelings and emotions involved with the process of growing-up. Not only because of the darkness of the various themes, but also due to the character development is it impossible to call this book a children's book anymore. Justice is what a lot of readers - including myself - probably missed in this book. Harry has won the Triwizard Tournament, but nobody truly acknowledges his victory. He still has to spend the summer with his merciless family, he still has to fight for his reputation and his dignity. After everything Harry achieved, life reveals itself to him in its cruelest colors, the Dark Lord's return only being one of the many aspects influencing his decline of happiness. This book also introduces one of the most despised characters in the Harry Potter universe, Dolores Jane Umbridge. Who could possibly like such a woman? Apart from imagining Imelda Staunton's inspiring portrayal from the movies which helped a lot with exploring Dolores' role in the book, her unforgiving decisions and her unforgettable appearances, it can be discussed whether Dolores Umbridge is truly a realistic character, but she supported J.K. Rowling's general direction into the dark themes of the series, and if there is one thing Dolores Umbridge's presence was good for, then it is this: It made Harry and his friends, but also the book's readers realize that life is never the way you imagine it to be. Life is cruel, life is hard, life is merciless.I love this book because it doesn't beautify things. Death is presented as a necessary part of everyone's life. All the characters are created as human beings who are full of faults and mistakes. The perfect images everyone had in their minds of characters like Albus Dumbledore, James Potter or even Sirius Black are shattered in the course of the book, only to allow the readers to form new opinions on those characters again. Those books are set in the fantasy genre, but it all felt so realistic that it was impossible not to share the thrill and the excitement of those pages - mainly because the characters felt so realistic. They are flawed. They are full of emotions. They come to decisions, and they regret decisions. But in their essence, they are human. Which is perhaps why so many readers love this series - because it feels like you accompany people into a completely different world who might as well be your friends who are sitting at your school desk next to you.[Major spoiler for this novel: (view spoiler)[I am not even angry with J.K. Rowling for killing off Sirius Black. Obviously, he was a character beloved by a lot of readers, and I would have loved to see Sirius being redeemed officially as not having committed the crimes he was accused of.

It's so detailed and thorough and interesting and I totally see why it's captured the world in it's wizarding claws. BUT. I didn't grow up reading it. And now? Reading it? I love a lot of things, but there are so many things that bother me, particularly about The Order of the Phoenix. THINGS THAT BOTHERED ME:+ The freaking gargantuan size. This is the most important thing to note. IT IS HUGE AND IT SHOULD NOT BE THIS BIG. The first 100-pages are numbingly boring...they cleaned house? SO WHAT. + Ron/Hermione's bickering drove me nuts. This trio of \"friends\" act so often NOT like friends, it just really grates on me. I know friends have their ups and downs, but Ron is downright rude. Harry is usually oblivious, but he doesn't help things much either. Of COURSE I'm Team Hermione here, and I know she gets together with Ron...but I ain't shipping it.+ The last 50-pages were so intense and interesting...WHY WERE THEY SO SHORT?? It's like the book FINALLY warmed up and got going and got exciting and -- BOOM! -- it's done now. Plus so many interest reveals just come as a Dumbledore info-dump. Um. Seriously?+ The characters, in general, drove me nuts. I love Dumbledore, don't get me wrong, but he's awfully passive. There's this whole attitude around like \"Awww, well nothing TOO BAD is going badly, so let's just wait until it gets absolutely horrific before we do anything, shall we?\" AND ARGHHH YOU STUIPD STUPID WIZARDS.+ And Harry's logic...I mean, lack thereof...was frustrating. Like \"Omg, a teacher is physically abusing me...I won't tell! I'm a strong brave little melon!\" NO YOU'RE A FREAKING IDIOT. Harry's whole mantra of just suffering in silence made me so so angry.+ Snape. Because it's a grand idea to have a teacher who abuses and bullies students because he had a crappy childhood. Solid work hiring him, Dumbledore. I HATE SNAPE, BTW.+ In general, the book's huge GARGANTUAN themes of \"injustice\". This one is very very much me, but social injustice and discrimination against children and adults exercising their age as a way to control/lord over younger humans -- I HATE IT WITH THE FIRE AND PASSION OF A THOUSAND SUNS. Sure, yes, it has it's place in books. It's realistic. But every time I pick up a Potter book, I just get smothered with how unjust everything is and it makes me SO ANGRY. And while there are 2 dozen things I love about these books, THAT is what makes me wait, like 9 million years between picking up volumes. There should be more balance. There should be more fighting back instead of passiveness.+ And please, someone remind me why Harry still needs to live with the Dursley's? Because I think we've established he doesn't. Another = injustice for no reason.OKAAAAY BUT YOU GUYS PROBABLY THINK I HATE HARRY POTTER NOW AND IT'S NOT TRUE.I also have a list of things I freaking loved. And at the end of the day, I do like this series. I don't \"adore\" it like a true Potterhead, I 'spose. But I do enjoy it.THINGS I ABSOLUTELY LOVE:+ The detail. okay, I do complain that the books are too big (they are) but I have to admit this makes the worlds SO INCREDIBLE DEEP. Like all the food details, the off-handed comments, the descriptions, the subjects. IT'S INSANELY AWESOME. It's not like reading about a bunch of kids going to school...it's like genuinely being there.+ The fact that they actually had to DO SCHOOLWORK. So often I read books about characters who are not \"geniuses\" but still manage to save the world AND score uber well in school without doing a scrap of homework. NO. So I love that Harry Potter makes them save the world AND do their homework. And half the time I think their homework sounds freakishy fascinating. Yes, I'm having a Hermione moment.+ HERMIONE. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE HER. She is like one of the biggest reasons I love this series and would even consider rereading (seriously!! I just said that!! Even though I complain!! I'd like to try audios one day...) because she's smart and into equality and rights and I just love her, yes okay?!+...oh and McGongall. I love her too. SO SO MUCH. She does not take a single piece of crap from anyone. SHE IS AMAZING. I love how she fought Umbridge, although I think she could've done more (like stabbed Umbridge in the eye or something) and I love how she's fiercely protective of her students. She's like a super scary mum.+ The Weasleys. ALL OF THEM! Even Ginny is getting more a personality now! YAAAY. I particularly love Fred and George and I'm glad they're living their dream. (Oh, but obviously I hate Percy.) Ron is not my favourite person unfortunately, because I think he's very self-obsessed and I do find him irritating at times. BUUUUT MRS. WEASLEY IS SO FEIRCE AND WONDERFUL.+ Also Luna...although I wish she had a bigger part. Maybe she will in future books?! I love her and her whimsical attitude. She's totally fascinating.+ And Neville is amazing. I particularly love how when Harry was teaching the secret Dark Arts class how Neville was just THRIVING. He didn't feel threatened, and he had one-on-one help with a peer he likes and respect. EQUALS = HIM DOING SO WELL. YAY!! I feel so so annoyed at this book too because I feel Neville has a learning disability and everyone just ignores it. Some teachers do a bit more, but mostly he gets abused - by teachers and students alike. I knoooow stuff like that happens IRL. But we're not reading real life are we??? We're reading about a WIZARD school and I'll be damned if I don't sit here and demand things like learning disabilities should be given respect and help. I love Neville. KEEP FIGHTING NEVILLE.+ And no matter how much I complain...I actually lost track of time while reading this!! That's right! I was reading and my eyes were burning at night and I was like \"OMG WHAT'S THE TIME?!\" so I totally read a lot later than I would usually. A book that absorbs me is definitely a good book.SEE?! I DO LIKE IT. Mostly. (I hated Umbridge of course, but duh. Who doesn't?) Ultimately it was too big and I got a wrist sprain just holding the jolly hardback, BUT! It's intense and magical and intriguing and I want to know what happens next. Also I want to see the movies."},

Yes, I did go to one and no, I didnU+2019t dress up.It was held at a Barnes and Noble and of course John WilliamsU+2019s soundtrack for the first 2 movies was played on a loop throughout the night. Amidst the crowd eagerly awaiting the stroke of 12, were tired adult chaperones and sullen workers who had had enough already. My brother brought me to the store and one of his friends was working there; of course being the only ginger on staff he had to dress up like Ron and did not appreciate it. I think he actually hated Harry Potter so that kind of made it worse.Let me preface this next paragraph with the following: I grew up in Las Vegas, so some weird stuff went down that probably wouldnU+2019t have happened anywhere else that night. Not only did the Mayor show up, but U+201CMaster MagicianU+201D Lance Burton did too. They are local celebs, though why they put in an appearance is beyond me. More on this in a minute.So at about 11:30 everyone starts lining up to get our books. The store decided to release them before midnight and that made it all the more like catnip. I remember seeing some four year olds plopped down in an aisle with their copies, pretending to read themU+2026and I thought, who would stop me if I just took it from the kid and ran out? I didnU+2019t though, obviously, but Potter fever makes you think strange thoughts, especially while waiting in line for a highly anticipated book.Both the Mayor and the U+201CMaster MagicianU+201D were signing copies of the book. I donU+2019t understand this at all, and still think that somewhere on ebay somebody must have bid on an U+201Cautographed copyU+201D and gotten one signed by one of these men. While thatU+2019s technically true, can you just imagine the disappointment??When I did finally have it in my handsU+2026 oh, that beautiful gloriously blue cover. You knew from Mary GrandPrU+00E9U+2019s artwork that something major was going to go down, and it did. I started reading it with a booklight on the drive home but was told that the light was distracting my brotherU+2019s driving. Buzzkill. DidnU+2019t he know how important this was?!?!?!?!Arriving home, I went straight to bed and stayed up all night reading. At some point, I think at about 2am, my mom came into my room. She took the book from me, and flipped towards the end, read about SiriusU+2019s death, then gave it back to me without a word. (She had read the first 4 to her third grade class and still chokes up at the mention of U+201Cthe boy who livedU+201D). She never actually read the fifth book or the rest, but always insisted I tell her everything that happened once I finished them.I finished it later that day. I didn't care too much that Sirius died, but I do remember being slightly miffed that Rowling never cleared up more about that Veil in the Department of Mysteries. That was such a cruel tease, Jo."},

So much character development, so many brave people sticking up for their friends. It's also the book that introduces us to my most hated fictional character ever. Never have I hated anyone as much as Umbrige. And being able to create such deep anger and loathing in me, with only words!, shows again what a fantastic writer Mrs. Rowling is.Here are some of my favourite scenes, characters and details:1.

Why write a consisteThis is my favorite installment of the quintessential modern bildungsroman. Nevertheless, it has its problems, familiar to any reader of Rowling's.She never seems to gain control of her writing, which spirals out into thousand-page doorstops filled with unimportant side characters and rambling plots. The story is moved along by arbitrary plot devices, often magic. Instead of using the magic to make her world seem more strange and wondrous, she uses it to cover up plot holes. Why write a consistent plot when you can just put in a spell or two to fix the problems?Likewise her world is poorly defined. She did not start by constructing the 'wizarding world' and then base her stories off of it, rather she changes her setting to fit whatever she needs at the moment. This constantly shifting setting means the world doesn't make much sense if you take the time to sit and think about it.Her fractured plots are not the result of 'realism', which some authors use to create a sense of a 'real world', separate from archetypes. Rowling is just trying to fit in all the disparate ideas and characters she has in her notepad. She becomes so attached to her characters and ideas that she is unwilling to sacrifice them for a more streamlined book.She has problems connecting the many dots of her story, but uses her magical 'plot devices' to keep us from noticing that the scaffolding behind the facade is rather bare (indeed: crumbly). Her rabid plot movement points away from the cracks in her storytelling: \"move along, nothing to see here\".I find it somewhat ironic that Rowling wants to 'graduate' from Potter to writing adult mysteries. A mystery needs to have a tight plot, based not in the characters but in the events surrounding them. Though many people tried to 'figure out' the Potter books and predict them, in truth there is nothing to figure out. Rowling's foreshadowing is vague and unsupported, and there are just as many clues as red herrings. The only reason some of the elements seem predictable is because there was a crack team of several million people making every guess under the sun. Combine that with the fact that the final book introduces completely new elements to finish the plot, and we can see that Rowling is not really in charge of her own pen. She is a slave to her own sentimentality. Then again, so are millions around the world.The only thing which makes these meandering plots move along at a reasonable pace are her characters. They connect us to the magical world, so that even if it doesn't make sense, at least we can see how it might work for the people who live in it.Her characters are vivid, emotional, motivated, and archetypal without being banal. They may not be psychologically deep, but for a monomyth like this, that is hardly the point. Most people aren't that complex, either.In the series, this book gets the prize for the most psychological depth and also the most consistent mood. Before this, Rowling was still trying to get her footing, figuring out what exactly she was writing, and trying to explain the world to her readers. She finally hit her stride in 'Prisoner of Azkaban', and got much of her unsure world-building out of the way in 'Goblet of Fire'. This is before she started feeling the pressure to wrap things up in a neat package, which again begins to take its toll on her consistency. This is the first, and really the last of her books where Rowling is able to write without being overly concerned with either the beginning or ending of her series.Instead of placing a scattered plot over her characters, Rowling was instead able to let the characters travel through their own path of growth and self-exploration. The change is the most apparent in Harry himself, and though his transformation is somewhat sudden, it is still honest and believable for the character.By focusing chiefly on her strength--character building--and escaping the constraints of the monomyth, if only for a moment, Rowling is able to avoid her weakest points as a writer and turn out her strongest book.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"},

This makes for slow moving plot sometimes. It does not help any that the book is probably the biggest in the series. To Harry's defense he has a pretty good reason for being such. A couple of reasons actually. Firstly, he is a 15-year-old boy in here. Remember 15-year-old yourself? You were full of angst, too. Secondly, Dumbledore failed Harry, hard. In fact he keep failing him over and over again until the last couple of chapters. The biggest lesson of it all: the adults can be wrong (as an adult it pains me to say it); even the ones you hold in the greatest respect like it is a case with Harry and Dumbledore.I do not think my review would be complete without mentioning the following character:This is how I envision her; the movie version was pretty good too. I am talking about Dolores Umbridge of cause. Compared to Lord Voldemort she is fairly low-level as far as villains go, but she was created in such a way that everybody and their brother love to hate her. So this is the first book of the series which gets less than perfect rating. The main reason is I feel that it could be made shorter - but I'll be damned if I know how. It is still great and everything, but 600+ pages are a little bit too much for a Harry Potter tale, especially the angst-y one. "},

Additionally the students are interested in dating, making the content slightly inappropriate for younger readers. Prose aside, we see new characters and many developments in the plot lines. We witness how powerful Dumbledore's abilities are the clear distinctions between Voldemort's death eaters and Dumbledore's army.

(i.e. Fudge and Umbridge)Amazon ReviewAs his fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry approaches, 15-year-old Harry Potter is in full-blown adolescence, complete with regular outbursts of rage, a nearly debilitating crush, and the blooming of a powerful sense of rebellion. It's been yet another infuriating and boring summer with the despicable Dursleys, this time with minimal contact from our hero's non-Muggle friends from school. Harry is feeling especially edgy at the lack of news from the magic world, wondering when the freshly revived evil Lord Voldemort will strike. Returning to Hogwarts will be a relief... or will it?The fifth book in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series follows the darkest year yet for our young wizard, who finds himself knocked down a peg or three after the events of last year. Somehow, over the summer, gossip (usually traced back to the magic world's newspaper, the Daily Prophet) has turned Harry's tragic and heroic encounter with Voldemort at the Triwizard Tournament into an excuse to ridicule and discount the teen. Even Professor Dumbledore, headmaster of the school, has come under scrutiny by the Ministry of Magic, which refuses to officially acknowledge the terrifying truth that Voldemort is back. Enter a particularly loathsome new character: the toadlike and simpering (\"hem, hem\") Dolores Umbridge, senior undersecretary to the Minister of Magic, who takes over the vacant position of Defense Against Dark Arts teacher--and in no time manages to become the High Inquisitor of Hogwarts, as well. Life isn't getting any easier for Harry Potter. With an overwhelming course load as the fifth years prepare for their Ordinary Wizarding Levels examinations (O.W.Ls), devastating changes in the Gryffindor Quidditch team lineup, vivid dreams about long hallways and closed doors, and increasing pain in his lightning-shaped scar, Harry's resilience is sorely tested.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, more than any of the four previous novels in the series, is a coming-of-age story. Harry faces the thorny transition into adulthood, when adult heroes are revealed to be fallible, and matters that seemed black-and-white suddenly come out in shades of gray. Gone is the wide-eyed innocent, the whiz kid of Sorcerer's Stone. Here we have an adolescent who's sometimes sullen, often confused (especially about girls), and always self-questioning. Confronting death again, as well as a startling prophecy, Harry ends his year at Hogwarts exhausted and pensive. Readers, on the other hand, will be energized as they enter yet again the long waiting period for the next title in the marvelous, magical series. "},

I was so anxious in fact that I actually fell for and spread around the story that volume 5 would be called U+201CHarry Potter and The Green Flamed Torch.U+201D Not one of my prouder moments. As soon as the book became available for preorder I went to my college computer lab (which I mysteriously still had access to) and ordered my copy online. Unfortunately, I failed to order it from an online store that would deliver it on the day it came out. It would be shipped on the day it came out. As it turned out, my brother got married the weekend of the bookU+2019s release. The wedding was on Friday and the book came out on Saturday. Saturday morning my sister, brother-in-law, my niece and I all got in their car and started heading home. We pulled off the highway into the first major town we could find and started driving around looking for a WalmartU+00AE so they could get their copies of the book. Finally, we spotted one and my sister and I started cheering like crazy people. My 1-U+00BD year old niece stared at us with a very confused look on her face as she wondered what in the world Crazy Uncle Ryan and mommy were doing. My sister and her husband both bought copies of the book and we started back out on the road. As we drove we took turns reading out loud and as Harry was sitting with Luna and Neville on the HogwartsU+2019 Express we pulled into my apartment complex. They left me there and I was stuck without a book. I watched countless friends reading the book over the next few days. I expressly forbad them from telling me anything about what happened as I checked the mail every single day wondering when my copy would actually arrive. During that wait a nice girl I knew let me borrow her copy one evening as she told me she was not going to read any more that night. I ran back to my apartment with the book under my arm cackling fiendishly and I read as much as I could knowing that I would have to return the book the next day. All in all, I ended up using three or four different copies before I finished reading this book. I then didnU+2019t see it for at least a month as I loaned it out to several friends to read.There were several times during this book that I get really frustrated with Harry. These times involve him loosing his temper with Umbridge. So many times I just found myself shouting at the book telling Harry to control his temper and not yell at her again. That woman is the DEVIL! I canU+2019t think of any character in the whole series that I dislike more than her and I include Voldemort in that. ItU+2019s no wonder that Rowling named her Dolores Umbridge. The name U+201CDoloresU+201D comes from the Latin word for pain. U+201CUmbrageU+201D (yes, Rowling changed the spelling for the name) means U+201Canger or resentment caused by some real or imagined wrong.U+201D That certainly describes her attitude and outlook accurately. U+201CUmbrageU+201D can also mean a shadow. She certainly is a dark presence that seems to brood over people.This book also contains what I think are the two most powerful and moving scenes in the series. Neither of which, incidentally, made it into the movie version. The first of these is the scene in St. MungoU+2019s where we see Neville visiting his parents. That scene along with the battle in the Department of Mysteries should leave no doubt in any readerU+2019s mind that, in spite of the fact that he is rather clumsy and awkward, Neville is extremely brave and absolutely belongs in Gryffindor. The second is the scene at the end after SiriusU+2019 death when Harry rages at Dumbledore and their subsequent conversation. You finally see all the anger and sadness that had been building up inside Harry since the end of book 4 come out and we all FINALLY get the answer we had been waiting for so long as to why Voldemort came after Harry in the first place. ThatU+2019s a very good scene.Of course, one of the coolest parts in this book, if not in the whole series, is the wizardU+2019s duel between Dumbledore and Voldemort. I love how Dumbledore is dueling the most feared dark wizard ever and keeps calling him Tom and speaking to him as though he we still his teacher and Voldemort is nothing more than a misbehaving student. That and the scene where Dumbledore tells Fudge that he has no intentions of going to Azkaban and than proceeds to knock out everyone is his office and disappears with Fawkes in a flash of fire just make you realize that Dumbledore is the most awesome wizard ever."},

I'm sorry, guys.Aaannyyywwayyyy, this book shot my expectations through the roof. It's like J.K. Rowling keeps getting better, but to do this she needs to smash my heart to pieces that get smaller with every book.For example, right here she has created my #1 Most Hated Character Of All Time (tie with Dan from SF, but that's a whole 'nother rant): Dolores Umbridge. Now, I swear, if I'm not developing this, it's because I know I would go on and on and on for about three Word pages.Close on her heels is Bellatrix Lestrange, whom I'd probably hate more if I'd spent more time with her. Thankfully, I didn't, because I would have set the book on fire. She did the one and only thing that could have made break down, and I did - big time.Another character that I used to hate is Snape, but now I think I actually love him a little bit. For one, he was bullied - by none other than (view spoiler)[perfect James (hide spoiler)], which explains a lot of things. (I know, there's probably around three people left in the entire world who haven't read this book, but you never know who might come across this.) For two, he's way more complex than he initially seemed. His involvement in the Order left me flabbergasted - not the simple fact that he was a part of it, but the way he acted. He was still an asshole, because that's just who he is, but he was badass too.Mrs Weasley made me so mad with the way she tried to keep our heroes in the dark about what was happening and to control them. She has wonderfully good intentions, I know that, but you can't expect me to tolerate the way she treats these guys. They're fifteen, after all, and they've been through things more dangerous that anything she has ever faced.I also got to hate James a little. Which is something I enjoyed like crazy, since I couldn't believe him as perfect as he was pictured in the first books. He was a conceited, insensitive bully, to put it plain and simple. And even though I would have liked not to like him, I'm still going through that phase where I'm impressed by the cool guy. Lily, on the other hand, was amazing. She actively loathed James, and that made me want to hug her. She's completely different from what I had imagined and I definitely hope we'll get to see more of the young Marauders, Lily and Snape. Yes, him too.Oh, and hey! I was pretty pissed at Dumbledore, too. He's a bit of an idiot, to be honest, but his explanation in the end made everything so much better... and it made me cry so much harder. (Oh, God.) He's finally human now, isn't he? He has feelings and does stupid things. And he's badass, too. I finally got to see him in action!For the first time ever, I felt more than a vague annoyance with Peeves - I actually liked him. Although he shows it in a particular way, he loves the school, guys! He's a brat, but he loves it, and he'd even do what people tell him to protect it.Cho: such a girl. Get a fucking grip, bitch! Though it's good that she managed to put Harry off her, because now he's free to look for someone more worthy of him. (This is half ironic, but not quite. I have a bit of a hero worship thing going on here.)But do you know why I still loved this book so much it hurts? Because all of this stuff up there rings true. Not in the oh-yes-finally-this-character-is-not-that-perfect way, or in the there-need-to-be-villains-in-every-book way (and anyway at least half of the characters I wanted to beat up were not villains); for the simple reason that there are idiots and jackasses everywhere, all the time. They might have good intentions, they might simply be too stupid to understand the consequences of their actions, they might just be cruel, but they're there. I mean, you have no idea of how many people I would love to kill daily.A weird thing: despite the number of \"finally\"s and \"for the first time\"s that appear here, which hint that I should be satified with this book, I still crave more. Unexpected.---I don't know where to fit this in the text, so I'll leave it down here. (Yes, I still haven't mastered the art of writing a coherent review. If you can call the rants I write reviews.)I have a never-ending and ever-growing admiration for Fred and George, because they're hilarious, brave and (okay, let's see if you can guess this one... [because self-deprecation is the weapon of the incompetent]) badass, but I'm getting more and more curious about Lee.

But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.U+201D Actual rating : 4.5 stars The order of the Phoenix , The fifth book of the series is a little bit controversial . the very same feeling harry had about his last week in Hogwarts , i do have about this whole book .he thought that his week seemed to last much longer than it really did because it stretched between two universes , one with Sirius and one with out .same experience i have with the book , the time when i first opened the order of the phoenix and started reading seems literally a lifetime ago , and though maybe it was because meanwhile i was a bit distracted from reading by some real life matters , or that the book's gigantic length of nearly 900 pages can be a significant reason , but there is also the other reason , that this book too stretches between two universes , the one Before and the one After , and the cutting event is the blunt recognition of the war ahead , the actual cutting line is , the beginning of the war.The first half of the book was a bit slow paced , but then the second half would flow so rapidly you forget all about it , the book reaches itU+2019s climax when, after a dream, Harry and several other members of the studentU+2019s secret club theU+201CDAU+201D ( DumbledoreU+2019s Army) venture to the Ministry of Magic to prevent Voldermort from torturing Sirius (or so they think ) .Both Harry and his readers are becoming adults throughout the duration of the series, the progression into a young adult is made evident in here through how Rowling shows a 15-year-old boy mind , harry deals with feelings of abandonment, yet heU+2019s also unable to stop thinking about how all the adults around him are either know-nothing , judgmental or unwilling to understand . He is definitely a lot angrier in this book . and there also were more fights and more arguments , In other words , heU+2019s 15 .Yes , right . he is growing a bit annoying and he isn't my favorite character , at least not in this one , But ! literature at its best reflects real life, whether placed in a realistic or an unrealistic theme . childrenU+2019s literature has been always showing that life is all rainbows and sun shines , when ever it starts telling the truth its no children book anymore , But RowlingU+2019s turn at realistic adolescence places the Harry Potter series in the realm of great childrenU+2019s literature. though I wouldn't have wanted to mention it , but its a bit hard not to , here this Major character loss is one of the most significant things that happened in this book , its utterly sad , I can even describe it devastating , because I think Sirius's death had came much earlier than it should .we experienced one of the first real losses here .I actually knew that Sirius black would die in this particular book , though no idea when or how , i was kind of waiting dreading the moment , though figures i had to wait for long 800 pages before my dread got confirmed , and inspite of that it still was shocking . i didn't expect it to happen this way , just like this , in the middle of a sentence , maybe i was kind of imagining a last moment conversation with harry , maybe because they never really had a proper one before , many things were pending between them , Harry actually never expressed himself to his Godfather , like Sirius never knew that the Dursleys we abusing , he was even surprised at some point that Harry was excited at the idea of leaving the Dursleys to live with him .and though i neither watched the movie nor read the book before , but to tell you it was spoiled for me just the same , by FB posts , Tumblre , Pintrest and whatever else , but does it matter ? it really doesn't .i usually do really mind spoilers , a series that's spoiled for me would be hard to catch my full attention , but as i said , not harry potter , its different here .  U+201CWe've all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That's who we really are.U+201DP.S. : seriously did I skip talking about Fred and George ? these two are hilarious ! their bold witty behavior , indifference , sarcasm and spirit ! they are a comic relief in the darkest times .Favorite characters ! these two are always included (Duh!) ."},

There are so many scenes to love in this one. Literally institutional scenes like DA and the Weasley's leaving school can be exclusively found in ootp and I love them so much. I also just think OoTP is SO funny? I mean, the whole school rioting against Umbridge, the twins pranks, the DA meetings, the things said about Harry / that Harry says back. I laugh out loud when I'm reading this book, and I don't usually properly laugh when I'm reading. I literally just don't understand how anyone can not like ootp. I mean, beside the very sad events at the end, it's perfect. And EVEN that sad event (view spoiler)[RIP SIRIUS ORION BLACK YOU DESERVED BETTER (hide spoiler)] gives us such a beautiful moment between Albus and Harry, that is sad, but also so incredibly human and heartbreaking and such an insight into the humanity and love that drives Harry's character it's amazing. anyway, tbh it's harry potter I shouldn't have to say much I loved reading this with all my heart, obviously.

It's better, I promise)From the moment I started this book, I knew it would end up being my favourite in the Harry Potter series so far, and I was not mistaken. I loved this book so much. It's definitely going in my favourites of all time list.This novel took me sooo long to read it, and I mean come on, give me a break, it was 800 pages... However somehow, Rowling made not even one page feel tedious or boring, which is amazing, considering its size.Perhaps I should've written notes whilst reading this, because I can't remember a lot in detail anymore as I read it over such a long time-span. Therefore, I make no promises about this review being any form of decent. (or in chronological order)The characters, I feel, in this book developed so much throughout, and really just left me loving (or hating, *cough* Umbridge *cough*) them even more, which I can't believe is even possible. It was so interesting to see into Snapes memories, and that whole scene in my head, rather than on screen. I can't wait to read more into Snape in the future books, he is such a complex character.I also loved Dumbledore as much as ever, as well as McGonagall (who was SO sassy in this book), her sass was honestly the best. I found myself cheering her along most of the time.Harrys friendship circle continues to grow and develop, I love reading how they all interact and protect one other.Sirius, the whole Order, and the Weasleys, I just loved! Especially at the end when everyone had Harrys back. Ah, love it.Umbridge, OH, don't even get me started on her... she was possibly even worse in the book than in the movie, I truly thought that wouldn't be possible, but *hem hem*, that woman is insane.You'll notice I'm spreading a few quotes out throughout this review, and that's because I couldn't simply choose just one to include. If you're reading them, I'm sure you'd understand why.Anyway, I noticed whilst reading this that there is so much in the book that is not in the movie! I actually loved that aspect, because it gave me a bit of surprise and apprehension when reading it.I also found that I got so much more out of the book, than in the movie, which is to be expected, but, having watched the movies countless times, it was amazing to be able to pick up the things I may have missed simply by watching it play out on screen. The whole 'prophecy' aspect, what that entailed, the small details, and even just the depths of the characters I found that I understood so much more by reading this.Basically, I just loved and adored this novel, and it is definitely my favourite in the series so far. I'm so excited to read the last 2, because those are the movies I remember least about, and I even find that I don't fully understand everything that goes on in Deathly Hallows."},

And I admit, it was my 2nd least favorite for a very long time. When I finally re-read it a few years ago, I revised my opinion. It's now one of my top favorites.When I first read it, as a young-adult, I was really annoyed with Harry's actions and attitude. I got frustrated with his frustrations and anger. It's funny that it took me getting older to actually become more understanding of this. I'm not sure if I was too close to that defiance and attitude from my own teenage years, and too disgusted with how I treated people during it, or what, but I've come to be incredibly sympathetic and understanding. Harry is actually quite reserved and thoughtful in this book, considering the circumstances. And he actually has excellent reasons for feeling the way he does.That's not to say that I'm not frustrated ever during this book, I definitely still get frustrated. It's just for different reasons now. Mostly, the same reasons as Harry. A lot is being held back from Harry in this book, and I really think he deserves to know more. More knowledge - as Dumbledore, especially, should know - is never a bad thing. And perhaps if he'd known a bit more, there wouldn't have been quite the devastation to follow.I know everyone loves Molly Weasley...I'm not one of them, at least not in this book. I love that she loves Harry, and she considers him \"as good as\" one of her sons, but she, like Ron, got on my nerves in this book. It's not her place to decide what's right for Harry. She did something similar in Prisoner of Azkaban and her brand of \"protection\" actually leaves Harry open to more danger. I wish she'd realize that, and stop trying to help.And, I know you're supposed to but, I HATE Umbridge. I can't even express the amount of hate that I have for this woman. She's a very good cautionary tale about what happens when zealotry has power. Something that's even more scary to me right now, what with the insanity going on within the democratic system in the US at the moment.So many things to love though!1. Tonks - I'd almost like to be a metamorphagus2. 12 Grimmauld Place - I love the play on words that JKR uses3. Ginny (in general) - considering how much I disliked her in Chamber of Secrets, this is a huge thing4. Extendable Ears - I love Fred and George5. Doxies6. Department of Mysteries7. Dumbledore's testimony8. Luna Lovegood9. Quibbler10. Sorting Hat's Song - and this leads into one of my biggest regrets with the series as a whole - I'll touch on it in my Deathly Hallows review11. O.W.Ls - Ordinary Wizarding Levels12. I must not tell lies. - GRRRRRRRR13. Angelina Quidditch Captain14. Boys trying to get in Girls dormitory - LOL! I love the slide15. Snape vs Umbridge16. Dumbledore's Army17. \"Weasley is our king!\"18. Ginny - again19. St. Mungo's20. Droobles Best Blowing Gum wrapper21. McGonagall vs Umbridge22. \"Give her hell from us, Peeves.\"23. Fred & George vs Umbridge24. All teachers vs Umbridge25. Neville, Ginny (yes again), Luna, Hermione and RonI also really love Dumbledore. I know that, in this book in particular, he's not everyone's favorite - and I question him myself sometimes - but by the end I adore him more than ever.I can't say that I love the end, but it's amazingly well done - it brings out a boatload of emotions in me, and I think that's probably why it was one of my least favorites - the emotions hit a bit too close to home when I read it originally, and then I have always associated this book with that time in my life. It's natural, but now that the pain's lessened a bit, I can look back on it and feel the missing naturally. And... well ... I do love it for that, I guess. It's so real and true. The emotions are honest and real. This book has gradually become one of my favorites in the entire series - and it's so much better than the movie. Honestly, if you think they can fit 870 pages into a single movie, then I don't even know what to say. There's so much that's truncated or missing entirely. Things that are moved to the next movie, or never even mentioned. And as I read this time I was struck, again, but how vivid and deep this world is, and how much I love being in it.This review also available at The Book Eaters"},

I could not put it down! I gasped out loud several times as I read the last few chapters, causing my wife to ask me what was wrong. I am a 50-year old management analyst who is probably the most even-keeled person you'll ever meet, and not given to emotional outbursts. The book really grabs your interest and holds it! I'm really glad I accepted the RMFAO Young Adult challenge, as well as the challenge from my son and daughter-in-law!Other reviews state that the Harry Potter books are not terribly original in their plots, characters, settings, etc., and I have to agree. However, the books are EXTREMELY well written so far. Very little happens that is not foreshadowed in some small way hundreds of pages earlier in the book, or in a previous book, and the foreshadowing is completely seamless. The overall effect is that, even though there ARE surprises, everything makes sense. It gives all of the fantastic events a feel of \"reasonableness\". There is nothing in the book that does not have a reason for being there. All of the events fit together perfectly, like the pieces of an extremely complex puzzle.The use of language is superb. The descriptions of people, things, situations, and so on are very engaging. It is hard to use the word \"realistic\" about a fantasy setting, but the descriptions really draw you into the story. You feel that you are living the story, truly feeling the emotions of the characters. You can feel Harry's powerful, heart-rending sorrow and remorse at the end of the book as if it were your own. You can feel the fear, suspense, anger, joy, laughter, and fury that you would feel if the events of the story were truly happening to you.The characters are the most engaging aspect of the book. They are so well done that you can immediately relate to them. The setting may be fantastic, but the characters are very, very real. More than that, you come to truly care about the characters. What happens to them matters to you. When someone dies in the book, you feel the loss personally. It is as if someone you knew and liked, someone close to you, had died.In my opinion, the fifth book is the best of the series so far, and I can't wait to start number six. I feel that some of the other reviewers are overly fussy in their criticisms of the main character and the feelings he displays in this book. Two of the main themes of this book -- death and the turbulent emotions of adolescent men -- are much more mature than those of the previous books. Book four dealt with death in some small way, but it was a \"clean\" death in that the main character could not reasonably feel any responsibility for it. Death in this book is \"messy\"; there is plenty of guilt to stir in with sorrow and remorse.On to the next one!"},

In my personal opinion, the novels begin as average stories at best - with Rowling trying to gain a proper control over her writing voice and style. They do show delightful promise with the worldbuilding and some sense of nice-enough characters, but all in all it's clear that marketing played a huge hand in selling the books early on. I'm not cynical enough to say marketing was all that did it, Rowling has a distinctly British charm and humour that shines even through her early books (and the world of Hogwarts provides a fantastic fantasy setting). However, something is missing from the first three books that is more present in this novel.Perhaps it is the nuanced political commentary - through displaying the failing inner workings of the Ministry of Magic Rowling appears to provide a critique on normal human political systems. The ideas that she displays include that in trying to do 'good' often laws are designed for those in power to keep power and secondly that those in power often fight among each other for power when they should be fighting bigger problems facing the world. This rings true for politics in Australia at the moment in particular where it seems as if the government and opposition government are busier fighting internal party battles than actually passing legislation. Perhaps it is the increased (and improved) characterisation present in this novel that causes this to be a more improved novel. You have Harry, Hermione and Ron showing more depth to different aspects of their personalities with their various fears and desires as teenagers and heroes being exposed. The fact that Harry houses more raw anger in this novel to go alongside his perfect heroic goodness leads him to become a more three dimensional figure. The same applies to his friends, however I think the most development of side characters is shown through Dumbledore and Snape. Firstly, because Dumbledore has more of an active role in this novel's plot and secondly because we see some of Snape's tragic, misunderstood, childhood. All I can admit is that this series is growing on me and I can see the unique brilliance and appeal now in how the audience for Harry Potter grew up alongside the characters. It's a nice series, if not particularly groundbreaking, with some charming moments and a clever magical world. I look forward to seeing how the last two books now play out. "},
{"rating": 1, "text": "This is the worst Harry Potter book. The characterization is unbelievable and annoying, taking the various holes in the world J.K. has created with Harry Potter and throwing them in the face of the reader with the expectation that they will accept anything at this point.

The characterization is unbelievable and annoying, taking the various holes in the world J.K. has created with Harry Potter and throwing them in the face of the reader with the expectation that they will accept anything at this point. Events in the world that main characters (and by extension, the reader) find outrageous and crazy are accepted by everyone else in the world without adequate reasons for their acceptance.Harry whines incessantly throughout this book. The entire time he is complaining about not getting what he wants and people not liking him, while turning away attempts by his friends to help him. He sort of acts like this throughout the rest of the series, but his outlook of wanting help from everyone except those who are trying to help him is really stressed in this book.This book also contains one of J.K.'s now signature death scenes. Rather than turning the death of a character into something touching and important to the reader, it happens in one sentence and it is not really apparent what exactly is happening. I had to go back and re-read the death scene after they started talking about it in later chapters because I was not sure that it actually had happened. Every one of the deaths throughout the rest of the book is (poorly) written in exactly this same way.In short, the only reason to read this book is because it is part of the series. I would almost suggest just watching the movie instead, as it is about five times better. I only wish that this book did not bring down the rest of the series by making the inconsistancies and logical problems in J.K.'s world abundantly obvious."},

Therefore, some of the events which happened terrified, enchanted and enraged me so much.I love seeing Sirius and Harry's relationship grow, I also love that we're introduced to the Order and the DA, both respectable, worthy causes!We also get Umbridge though.... Gahhhh I hate Umbridge....and Bellatrix, and Voldamort himself I guess (although I never hated him as much as those two ladies just mentioned!)So much exciting and very dramatic stuff happens in this. We see Dumbledore preoccupied and taking a back-seat, we see power shifts and changes to the rules, we see court trials, songs, jokes, pranks, Quiddich, training and SO MUCH MORE.These books for me are a massive part of my life, and they are just divine. I love this one so much and I am so looking forward to continuing, but not to having to eave this world again! Naturally a 5*s :)"},

{"rating": 5, "text": "My favorite. My absolute favorite book in the series. The double whammy of Voldemort and Umbridge, the first major death, Harry being defamed by the ministry, it's all too wonderful. And it turns out that my kids agree. This has been the one that has really gotten my daughter (who just turned 8) fully invested in the series, and my oldest son (11) who already knows the story also claims this as his favorite. "},

Altogether this is longer and darker than any book in the series previously, but it deals with weightier issues and the characters are built upon as they go through hell and back. As I'm too lazy to write an actual review, I'm simply going to paste in a quote by Stephen King, who I think hits the nail on the head in his sentiment towards The Order of the Phoenix:\"Is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as good as the other Harry Potter books? No. This one is actually quite a bit better. The tone is darker, and this has the unexpected- but very pleasing- effect of making Rowling's wit and playful black humor shine all the brighter... Will kids (and adults as well) still be wild about Harry 100 years from now, or 200? My best guess is that he will indeed stand time's test and wind up on a shelf where only the best are kept; I think Harry will take his place with Alice, Huck, Frodo, and Dorothy, and this is one series not just for the decade, but for the ages.\"EDIT- 17 DECEMBER 2015: I was thinking about this book recently, and I feel I should tell you that my most hated characters in this series are Voldemort, Umbridge, and Ron. In that order. I honestly, truly, fucking despise Ron. That is all."},

Starting with the dementor attack in the first few pages and continuing through Umbridge's evilness, all the way to Sirius' death (which on second read seems tacked on and unnecessary). What makes Four and Six so good is that they retain the sense of fantasy wonder that drew so many readers to the series in the first place. The Triwizard Tournament (4) and the Horocruxes (6) were just plain cool. The tournament was a fun story element and set up what is thus far the most important few chapters in the series. The horocruxes presented a great plot for the whole book and gave a basis for where the series is actually going to head down the stretch.  But what was there in 5? There is a bare minimum of quidditch, dumbledore's army is a very minor part, the Grawp storyline is total filler, the whole thing with the department of mysteries isn't all that engaging until the climax, and then ends with a silly prophecy (Why doesnt Voldemort just steal harry's wand, tie cinder blocks to his legs and throw him in the lake?) and a much-too-quick duel between Dumbledore and Mr. Riddle. There's just not enough fun in this book. Although i did like how the Cho subplot was dealt with.  And then at the very end, after all the doom and gloom, Rowling drops the ball on giving a glimmer of happiness. When Harry leaves the train platform, some of the Order is there, including much of the Weasley family. But where is Percy? Now that nobody is denying that V-thug is back, it would have been the perfect opportunity to show that Percy is back with the \"good guys\" without having it be overblown and sappy. This book is probably the most confounding of the six so far, since when you look back at it, after nearly 900 pages and seemingly so much going on, there was very little substance as far as the big picture goes: Fudge now believes Dumbledore. Sirius is dead. Is there really anything else that happened in this book that matters? Umbridge was just there to be the cunty character that Rita was in 4, and doesnt figure into 6 at all. Occlumency seemed interesting, but it ended with Harry giving up and us learning that Snape doesn't like Harry or his dad (really????).  This rant could all end up negated if certain aspects get flushed out in 7. This happened in 6, when it turned out the diary in 2 wasn't just a cheesy little contrivance. We shall find out soon..."},

But with the new book coming out in a couple of days, I have to go through them beginning to end. To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats. For this review, I will be writing as an unnamed member of the Bush administration.So, how long until we can get this Rowling woman into Gitmo?I mean really, have you read this book? It's an 800-page diatribe encouraging children to not only question authority, but to actively disobey it! I mean look at what we have here - there's a magical government that is responsible for to oversight and management of magical folk in Britain. Now I'm not entirely sure how this organization works, but I do know this - where there is a government, there is authority, and that authority must be there for a reason. No matter how much you may disagree with it, you have to understand that everything those in authority are doing is for your benefit.It pained me to see how the character of Dolores Umbridge was treated in this book. She single-handedly tried to bring order to Hogwarts and steer it from the liberal-free-thinking path to destruction paved by that long-haired hippie Dumbledore. And what did Umbridge get for her hard work? The Medal of Freedom? No! She got carried off by a pack of wild centaurs. How is that right? Moreover, what kind of example is that setting for American children?Now I don't care if Rowling wants to cripple a generation of readers in Britain. Go ahead, it's not like we need them anyway. But with these books becoming so popular in the United States, there is a very great danger that her insidious brand of rebellion and individualism will infect our children as well, and where will that lead us? Into howling chaos, that's where! Our children will see their favorite characters being disobedient and rebellious with no consequence, and it won't be long until they're thinking they can follow their example. If we let them, our children will become just as uncontrollable as the little monsters in this book.I urge you, if you have children, not to let them read this book. It will do nothing but damage that will take years to undo. All you parents need to do is remind them is that there are people in authority - like yourselves - who know what is right for them. They just have to listen, not question, and obey, not understand.I just hope that this trend doesn't continue in the next couple of books. Personally, I'd like to see all those kids locked up and that Muggle-hugger Dumbledore thrown off a parapet or something. The sooner Hogwarts comes back under Ministry control, the better everything will be."},

And I can say that I think I enjoyed it a lot more the second time around. I've always said this one was my least favorite in the series because it's a bit more depressing, Harry is so moody, and everything seems to be going wrong--oh, and Umbridge. But this time, I totally understood Harry's frustration and angst, and I sympathized with his mood swings and outbreaks a lot more. He is under so much pressure for a 15 year old boy. And no one believes anything he says. I found Harry less 'moody' and more justified in his anger.One thing that I continue to find myself thinking, as opposed to the first time reading the series, is how much I dislike Snape. Even though I know the end of the series and how Rowling plays it all out, I still don't like him. I don't think his reasons for hating Harry are justifiable, even when we see in his memory in this book. Something fun that I noticed reading this was that when Harry first arrives at Grimmauld Place and helps the crew clean up the house, as they are searching Kreacher's nook they find 'a locket,' but they don't think anything of it. Easter egg!Overall, obviously 5/5 for the construction of the story, the character development, and just my love for the series overall. "},

So really, what is there for lil ol' me to say?!I'll give you some of my quick thoughts and feelings. Like I already said, this one is the darkest so far. Harry came across as a whiny, poor me kid throughout most of the book. He is justified in being that way, but that's how he was nonetheless. For the first time, Hogwarts was somewhere I didn't want to be. I was so pissed at this fact I wanted to cry. A lot of sadness, tears, and pain occur throughout this story. I love this world, but at times this story was difficult to get through for me due to the emotional turmoil inside it. With that being said, I still loved the book, gave it five stars, and can't wait to get to the next one!!!!"},

Four stars.Second read: 20th February, 2016. Two stars.]Read as part of the #InfiniteVariety2016 Reading Challenge based on the BBC's Big Read poll.I was looking forward to this book for one and only one reason: Luna Lovegood. I don't remember much of the book from when I first read it all those years ago, and most of my memories were definitely from the film only, but I have to say it was incredibly disappointing in many ways.The writing during the series has definitely improved since The Prizoner of Azkaban, which you'd expect with the fifth. I suppose since the length of each book has almost tripled since the first book, that should have had to be the case. However, despite the improvements to the writing, I still can't see much improvement to the story as a whole.We're getting more characters (more diverse characters) but I still find that most of the bad-or just the ones were supposed to dislike-ones are all a little ugly or fat. As if to say, this is how you know who're you're supposed to like and who you're supposed to hate. Whilst I know these books are aimed primarily at children, I don't find this a good excuse. Children aren't that stupid.Ron and Harry haven't changed much since day one, either. They're both gotten themselves an awful lot of hormones, which happens to anyone, unavoidable, and Harry was super annoying in this one (though, whilst I find that understandable considering how he feels that he might be more like Voldemort than he would like, there was no need for so much caps lock) but I haven't noticed any kind of change in either of them that you'd expect by the fifth book. Hermione, however, seems to change almost every book. At first I enjoyed this change, and whilst I would agree that in general girls change at a faster rate than boys do, it still feels like overcompensation.And now we come to Luna. I thought it was odd that she just turns up and becomes quite an important character from the off, but she was also incredibly flat in the book. I didn't realise that Film Luna had had a bigger impact on me than Book Luna did, and in fact I'd go far as to say that I didn't enjoy Book Luna at all. Not because she was weird, or odd, or picked on, or a little aloof, but because she was just a \"There\" character. Yes, we get she's weird, but it feels like that's the only reason she was there.The story has a whole didn't keep me all that entertained, either. It felt like a repeat of, well, all the other books, with just a bit more death thrown in. I like that the books are getting darker, but I don't think just adding death really counts. I feel like the moment of falling in love-or even just like-with this series like I was when I was twelve has passed by and it won't come back."},

It's dark, it's angsty, it's the beginning of the end. Harry now realizes that all this isn't just going to go away... it's a fight to the finish. This is the first time that I've re-read OOTP since reading the Deathly Hallows when it came out a few years ago. And I found myself very surprised at the hints that were in there and so easily overlooked that relate to DH. The choices, the state we're in when we're trying to decide what to do... How fear can take those decisions out of our hands and make them for us... Knowing what was coming in the last book definitely make this one a different reading experience for me. And, honestly, it was a little bit EASIER to read too, especially when it came to Sirius. Oh I still cried, but, somehow I wasn't the wreck that I usually am when I've read this in the past. Harry's grief and anger and guilt hurt and were hard to watch, but knowing the final outcome made it all easier to bear, I think. God I love this series."},

And I didn't exactly hate that. Ok, it was INFURIATING when he went off on Ron & Hermione, but his angst was so raw and real, it took the story itself on a whole other level. Can you blame him for being upset? He's basically shut out from the situation all summer break, without anyone telling him whats going on in the Wizarding World, it's not exactly fair, is it? But it was so sad watching him have a difficult time this time around in Hogwarts because of all the nasty things happening once Umbridge showed up, and nobody believed him about Voldemort's return.UMBRIDGE: OH MY GOD. The b**ch. I LITERALLY CRINGED EVERY TIME SHE SHOWED UP, SHE WAS SO AWFUL MY GOD HOW TO EXPRESS MY HATRED AAGSHGDH! But. BUT. I watched the movies before reading this series. So I knew what happened to this god-awful toad looking creature. So I truly enjoyed every single scene she was in, just thinking of how it ends for her. :')Dumbledore's detachment: this time around, Harry can't confide in Dumbledore, because he's basically avoiding Harry. Watching Harry feel so alone and betrayed by Dumbledore physically hurts. BUT THAT ENDING WHERE DUMBLEDORE BEARS HIS HEART AND SOUL TO HARRY. WOWOWOWOWOWOW. No words can explain. That was a FANTASTIC scene.Dumbledore's Army: THESE SCENES WERE EVERYTHING. Every time it was announced that a meeting would take place my heart would soar, because they were absolutely my favorite parts of the book. They were the rare times where Harry was truly happy in this story, which made every single scene spectacular.Cho: God. I can't. I CANNOT. Out of everybody, EVEN UMBRIDGE, I really REALLY couldn't stand Cho.Ginny: Her badassery is FINALLY coming to the surface and I'm LOVING EVERY MOMENT. She's becoming a very interesting character, because she's basically a mixture of her brothers' best qualities: she's loyal, mischievous, brave, quirky, funny, an amazing girl. Can you see the ship floating? Can you see it? The fact that Ron is also 100% onboard the Harry/Ginny ship is giving me life. I CANNOT WAIT for Half-Blood Prince, because I think it's when they'll finally have their moment, now that Cho is finally out of the picture.Hagrid's story: I didn't really...like it? I found it very anti-climactic, and frankly pointless.. Grawp was an excellent addition to the story, but Hagrid's secrecy and detachment in a time when Harry really needed him was extremely frustrating.Occlumency: You know when I said that the DA meetings were my favorite parts? Yeah, well I lied, because OCCLUMENCY MEETINGS WITH SNAPE ARE EVERYTHING. You guys may not know, but Snape is one of my most beloved characters of all time. For SO LONG I love/hated him during the movies, but once the final movie came out I became loyal to him. Snape is one of the most fascinating characters I've ever read/watched and this book cemented my love for him. The Occlumency meetings were perfection, and now that I've read the book I can honestly slow-clap to the movie actors because that scene was SPOT-ON. When I read the book I was literally picturing every single word in my head just like the movie portrayed it, and that was amazing. The things we learn from Snape's past during these meetings were so revealing and eye-opening; it's the beginning of cracking his exterior to find out what he's really like; I'm SO excited for Half-Blood Prince because it has SO MUCH SNAPE Luna Lovegood: her introduction to the series was basically one of my most anticipated parts of reading the books for the first time, and it did NOT disappoint. What I didn't expect was adoring Luna's movie version a lot more than the book version, because the actress did an amazing job in showcasing Luna's strangeness with a lovableness that's sort of absent in the book. I'm very much obsessed with her character so reading about her was everything I wished for, and more.The end: I don't really want to sit here and hash-out all my heartbreak because I would have to type for 500000 hours, so I'll just say this: it was one of the best literary work I've ever read in my life. The chapters throughout #36-38 were absolutely breathtaking, and so tense, it was an experience like no other. J.K. Rowling continues to astound me. AND THE DA KILLED IT. Harry should be proud. I'm SO EXCITED TO CONTINUE WITH THIS SERIES but getting slightly concerned because I'm almost done with it... two more books. And that's it. No more Harry Potter.... I'm going to go now, before I lose it.   ...more          "},

But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has some of my most treasured moments in the entire series: Luna Lovegood and all of her amazing and quirky moments; Neville gaining self-confidence and standing up against the Death Eaters in the Ministry of Magic; Fred and George's pranks, jokes, dialogue, and every other scene involving them; McGonagall interrupting Snape and giving one million points to Gryffindor House & Peeves causing chaos and trouble all around.As hilarious and light the book was at times; sadness and darkness weighed heavier. Darkness follows light, and thus death and destruction ensued eventually *sighs*. The death still hurts. (view spoiler)[PADFOOT, DON'T LEAVE MOONY ALONE *hysterical crying* (hide spoiler)]One part of me doesn't want to start Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, knowing that he is going to die..My Review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire...  1st read in August 2014U+2B50 U+2B50 U+2B50 U+2B50/5 (8.25/10)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix displays HarryU+2019s capabilities of being a leader and RowlingU+2019s capabilities of growing with Harry as he grows older. Rowling clearly shows that Harry is growing up. The reader can read Harry becoming more responsible; learning to control his emotions. As Harry grows up, the reader grows with him.ItU+2019s very sad to see that nobody believes Harry Potter and Dumbledore. People - mainly students - start to believe the lies the press - The Daily Prophet, the Ministry of Magic - is telling them. This is very upsetting for both Harry and his friends. ItU+2019s off-putting to see how many people think Harry has lost it. The ostracising of Harry makes my heart weep with sympathy for the poor boy who hasnU+2019t got any parents. The novel yet again displays some bigotry. Professor Umbridge, who works for the Ministry of Magic, is a sadistic and evil human being. (view spoiler)[When Harry tells the truth about VoldemortU+2019s return, he has to write lines in his own blood. (hide spoiler)] She doesnU+2019t like half-breeds or anything that isnU+2019t a pure-blood wizard. Harry realises in the novel that it isnU+2019t Voldemort - aka the bad guys - vs innocent, warm-hearted and friendly people. The world isnU+2019t divided in two groups; it isnU+2019t: U+2018YouU+2019re either with me or against me.U+2019. For instance, Dumbledore is against Voldemort, however, there also people - the Ministry of Magic - who are against Dumbledore. From that one cannot deduce that the Ministry of Magic is together with Voldemort. ItU+2019s much more complicated than that. And I am very glad and happy that Rowling shows this and explains it. The novel is to some degree predictable. This makes the novel less exciting because the reader knows what is bound to come. It hasnU+2019t got the jaw-dropping surprises the previous novels contained. Even though there is one surprising death, it doesnU+2019t really come as a shock, because it was obvious that somebody needed to die. (view spoiler)[The death of Sirius Black is mostly painful because it is painful for Harry. It wasnU+2019t really painful for me because I got a bit unattached with Sirius when Harry saw the memory of Professor Snape being severely bullied by Sirius and James. (hide spoiler)]The novel has, as its predecessors have, humour in it. At times the light-heartedness is very difficult to find, especially as the novel comes to its climax. The humour makes all the situations more manageable for both the readers and the characters. The novel gives more depth and more information on the characters. ItU+2019s very delightful to know more about the characters. I feel that in each new Harry Potter novel I dive in deeper into the pool that holds the characters. This makes my Potterhead-heart beat with excitement. U+2018 U+2018Listening to the news!

I remember when I was a teenager I would often find myself having fits of anger without any reason at all. I would be pissed with people that I did not even know, I would antagonize my parents and friends just for the sake of doing it. As Harry is now a fifteen year old, we find him going through all this hormonal problems. Throw in the mixture the fact that there is a psychopath trying to kill him while no one believes what he says and, to worsen the situation, his friends have ignored him during all summer, and you have a perfect recipe for explosive behavior.tThe atmosphere of this book is, since the beginning, much more mature than in the predecessors. As in Goblet of Fire, here Harry starts being attacked by his enemies already at the beginning of the book. Because of these attacks, he is summoned to a hearing at the Ministry of Magic. So, after having passed the whole summer without a word from friends and even from Dumbledore, he is U+201CrescuedU+201D from the DursleysU+2019 by a bunch of people, some of which he has never seen before. He ends up being transported to the old mansion of SiriusU+2019 family, which is serving as headquarters to the people that want to oppose Voldemort and his followers.tHere is where I started noticing the big difference in atmosphere on this book in comparison to the previous ones. There is no staring at everything that is magical in awe anymore, there are no more long descriptions giving background to every little magical thing that pops up in the story. It is clear that Rowling is expecting everyone to know their whereabouts while reading her story already, so she focuses more on character/relationships development than in any former book.tRegarding the Black mansion, while it was fun to explore a new place, I found it particularly hard to accept that such a nice sensible person as Sirius is related to someone as nasty as Bellatrix Lestrange. ItU+2019s justU+2026 not right. tAnyway, soon enough we are led to HarryU+2019s hearing, which allow us to see for the first time some parts of the Ministry of Magic. I actually liked the Ministry, in general, but didnU+2019t like most people working there. Especially at HarryU+2019s hearing, everyone was treating him harshly, even those who were supposed to support him; really sad. Here we are also introduced to one of the character who would become hated by almost everyone: Dolores Umbridge, but I will talk more about her later.tWell, after this events everyone is soon enough on their way back to Hogwarts. This is when we are introduced to one of my favorite characters ever: Luna Lovegood. I like her so much! Yes, she is lunatic, but she is so essentially good and innocent, being at the same time extremely wise, that I canU+2019t help the feeling that we would be really good friends if she was a real person. As the story goes on, she unknowingly acts like a wall of stability in HarryU+2019s life, even when darkness seems to be winning, and that is really sweet.tAs for the normal school affairs, there is a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, as usual, only this time itU+2019s a woman: Dolores Umbridge. Yes, a former Ministry agent as a teacher. She soon makes it clear that she is going to teach following strict guidelines given by the Minister of Magic and no one elseU+2019s. That gradually leads some students to act rebelliously, trying to learn how to defend themselves properly on their own. When this fact comes to UmbridgeU+2019s attention, she manages to pull a few strings of her own, what makes the imperative influence that the Ministry had been imposing over Hogwarts to grow even more. Things soon get out of DumbledoreU+2019s control, Hogwarts becomes almost like a military school. This is what makes me hate Umbridge so much; she manages to, for almost an entire book, destroy that welcoming atmosphere that made me think of Hogwarts as home, and this is unacceptable. Sooner than later the students get their little piece of revenge on her, though, and that is amusing to see.tAnyway, political conflict isnU+2019t the biggest problem during HarryU+2019s fifth year at Hogwarts. Comparing to when he starts having very vivid nightmares and those start coming true, that is nothing. Yes, the evil lurking outside is not only outside anymore, itU+2019s tormenting him from inside his own head. This peculiar situation leads to a few very especial lessons and impressive discoveries about HarryU+2019s father past in Hogwarts. ItU+2019s interesting to get to know a little bit more about his parents under a different, not so friendly, perspective.tDespite his lessons against mental rape, though, Harry is not strong enough. Evil uses the window of opportunity created by his young mind to lead him and his friends into the most epic adventure in the series so far, in my opinion. Unfortunately, not everyone gets out of it unharmed and the outcome of it changes not only HarryU+2019s life forever, but also the whole worldU+2019s. We were used to the customary pattern on the former books: Harry is with the Dursleys during the summer; at the end of the summer he would go to the Weasleys' or some other place and then to school; something serious would happen during his stay there and he and his friends would try to solve the problem. Not anymore. Not after this book. ThereU+2019s no safe place any longer, not even Hogwarts.tI like this book a lot. ItU+2019s my favorite after The Prisoner of Azkaban, actually. Despite the darker tone, which is present since the beginning, it still contains some very sweet parts and hilarious scenes that made me laugh hard. My only advice would be to people be prepared to lose some favorite character here and there, for in this book Rowling starts to display some symptoms of what I call the U+201CGeorge R. R. Martin syndromeU+201D. Beware.  Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review:  Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure.  Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.  Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.  Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young."},

Bella Swan, Luce Price, Laurel Sewell, Ever Bloom, Nora Gray, Bethany Church... but dear, oh dear, I think there is a special place in this pantheon of horrible MCs for Harrietta Potter. Truly, not since Evermore have I encountered this much priviledge and first-world angst rolled into one big ball of Mary Sue.Harrietta isn't just annoying and whiny - she is so laughingly short-sighted it's a miracle she is still alive. Constantly fighting authority figures without a second thought of the consequences, never listening to her well-meaning friends, putting her petty feelings before the important missions she has to face - from beginning to end, she is a twit, through and through. In one particularly stupid instance, she gets her friends to risk their skin so that she can talk to a fugitive about the fact that her father was a huge douchebag!I might have bought it if she was just your every-day fifteen year old girl, but she isn't! She's been in Hogwarts for four years, faced death at thrice as many times (if not more!) yet she hasn't drawn the simplest of conclusions! How silly is that? Shouldn't she have more sense? Shouldn't she have learned by now to think before she acted? Has she no sense of self-preservance? Honestly, if she were a boy, I'd have said she thought with her dick!*furious whispering*What? What do you mean that she is indeed a boy?*more whispering**puts on glasses and reads the cover again*Oh, it's  Harry , not Harrietta! I did wonder why she couldn't get into the girls' dormitories! Well, in that case, it's all fine! Silly me! Please disregard everything I said above, this is surely a literary masterpiece that deserves a five star rating! What jolly good fun!So I was reading this book yesterday when this blogpost by Lindsay Ellis popped into my mind. I've already linked it before in a status update, but I figured that I might just do it again, because it's a really good post on female characters and the standards we hold up to them. It came to mind while I was reading  Order of the Phoenix  because at one point, I thought: \"Merlin, Harry, TSTL much?\" And then I paused. TSTL? Don't we usually apply that to female heroines?And then my inner feminazi kicked me in the ass. Note, that's the Zuka Club from Ouran Hight School Host Club. A very nice anime, highly recommended. Yes, yes, Potter fans, I know it's ludicrous that above, I compared Harry to Bella Swan. And, yeah, I guess that maybe I was a bit harsh in my comment. I mean, it's not like Harry mopes, rushes into stupid situations without thought, does exactly what he shouldn't do, and expect his friends to do everything for him......Oh, wait......Well, at least Bella is a couple of years older......Nah...I will go out on a limb and say this, Harry Potter is not as bad as Twilight. It's ludicrous to call it that. For example, most of the characters in the HP books are great, and sympathetic (read: Neville and Snape). In many instances, they are the saving grace of this series (Snape, Snape, Snape... did I mention Snape?). The worldbuilding is awesome. There are actual consequences to the stupid things the characters do. The list goes on and on and on. BUT! I can't deny that Harry gets away with a lot of stupid stuff, some stupid enough to outstage Bella's melodramatic dive in New Moon. (view spoiler)[ Get this: He sees Snape's memory of James Potter torturing him. Gets mopey, and decides to talk to Sirius, but the only fireplace he can use is in Umbridge's office. So he lets Fred and George cause mayham, which gets them expelled, so that he can go in there and talk about the fact that his dad was a bumrag when he was 15. He does this, by the way, even if Sirius gave him a safe means for two-way communication, while Umbridge is just waiting to get him expelled, and knowing that one false step can lead to the discovery of the order and Sirius' immediate execution.  (hide spoiler)]Had Harry been a girl, we'd have tripped over ourselves to call him TSTL and Mary Sue. Why do you think Hermione is so likeable and relatable? It's because she's a heroine, and the fact that she isn't the titular character saves her, mostly, from scrutiny. We really do hold up a higher standard for our female protagonists than we do for the men.Why is that? Is it because heroes are traditionally men and women somehow have to one-up them to prove themselves worthy? Is it culture causing these presumptions? Biology? Social constraints? Who knows?Once again, I don't deny the merits of the HP books. In fact, my friend Tamara wrote a my link post on that on the Lantern. Hell, HP7 is the only book I've seen getting people to camp out to get, or at least to preorder in Bulgaria. I love the world of magic Rowling creates, and what a rich, wonderful secondary cast there is. But this whole world revolves around a whiny fifteen-year old that relies on coincidences (and a little help from his friends), to battle villains that are more cartoons than actual, threatening characters. I mean, seriously, Umbridge? She's so ridiculous I'm surprised they haven't used her as a spell against boggarts. Even Lord Voldemort, while creepy in his own right, doesn't seem to live up to all the buildup there is to his return in the first four books. Will Harry always be the hero unquestioned, simply because he's a dude?[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[ Get this: He sees Snape's memory of James Potter torturing him.

Upon a second reading, I utterly agree; the 5th book is my least favorite so far, by quite a bit. In a way, I the things that bugged me about this book are actually...things that probably add a little bit of depth or complexity to it. At the same time, I don't read Harry Potter for either depth or complexity. I read Harry Potter because it's fun. The 5th book isn't fun; it's annoying. I challenge anyone to re-read it and disagree. Spoilers ahead.1) TEEN ANGST. EVERYWHERE. FOR. THE. ENTIRE. BOOK. I guess I kind of forgot about it. Either that or when I was an angsty teen myself, reading about Angsty Teens didn't stick out as noteworthy. In this book, it drove me bonkers. Harry pretty much spends the entire book shouting at Hermione and Ron, and being downright trollish toward Cho. No amount of trauma in the 4th book can make up for an entire year of jerkdom. And Hermione and Ron bicker for the. entire. book. Ugh. I know that to a certain extent this is realistic, but it's just not very fun to read about.2) The Ministry of Magic--They're emulating the GOP here, seriously. The Ministry reminded me way too much of politics to give me any remote enjoyment from that part of the book, which was a significant part. I completely forgot about the fact that 1) despite significant evidence to the contrary (ahem, climate change), the ministry completely ignores the evidence that Voldemort is back, because it would be inconvenient. 2) they then commence a (successful) slur campaign on anyone who says otherwise, 3) they actively stifle and make illegal any possibly discussion of Voldemort's return, 4) they take away crazy amounts of power from anyone who dares to argue, and 5) they're just jerks.3) Umbridge. I think she's a good foil to mess up Hogwarts but she was just too overblown; the crazy things she did were just so over the top that I couldn't take her (or much of the book) remotely seriously. [Though, the one over-the-top thing that I did enjoy was her quill of doom--making the kids write lines in their own blood is pretty deliciously nasty]4) Weird and bizarre decision making from Dumbledore and the Order. Let's take a (highly paraphrased) example from the book.  Harry: Dude, I just had a dream where I WAS VOLDEMORT'S SNAKE. And I/it attacked Arthur Weasley. And it was all true.Person In Charge: You should really take Occlumency.Harry: ?Person In Charge: We don't want you seeing what Voldemort sees. We want you to shield your brain. Oh yeah, since Dumbledore doesn't want to have anything to do with you, you're going to take lessons with Snape, because that's going to go really well. I'm sure you two will get over your differences and have great one on one occlumency lessons.Harry: But wouldn't it be useful to see what Voldemort sees? Like a weapon or something?Person In Charge: Mind your elders and make sure you practice your Occlumency; we don't want you seeing anything.Harry: Wha...?At that point, why the heck wouldn't you tell Harry: Oh, and PS--if you can't shield your mind, Voldemort may be able to send you false visions and/or take over your body; this should give you incentive to practice. (Though in fairness to Person In Charge--Harry, especially with the constant companionship of Hermione, should have figured that one out). 5) Instead, the whole climax scene of the book is ridiculously contrived: Voldemort sends Harry a trick message, so Harry and Co. go investigating, and do a lot of *really* dumb things along the way. They eventually manage to bungle their way through an attack by 15+ death eaters and stay alive long enough for the order to arrive. [The whole lead up to the end scene is equally ridiculous. First, and my biggest pet peeve of the whole book, is that Sirius gives Harry a mirror that is a safe way for the two of them to communicate, but Harry forgets to open the package, so instead tries to check on Sirius by floo powder and gets tricked by Kreacher and caught by Umbridge. After getting captured by Umbridge, a ridiculous scene ensues where Harry & Hermione lead Umbridge into the Forbidden Forest and feed Umbridge to the centaurs. The centaurs attack Harry and Hermione and then are attacked in turn by Hagrid's half brother the troll, who just happens to have gotten loose. Magically in the middle of the Forest, Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Neville catch up with Harry and Hermione, then they all ride invisible(ish) magic horses to the Ministry of Magic where more mayhem ensues]6) I did like the fact that a) we learn a bit more about Neville and his parents; b) the fact that Neville finally starts to prove himself, c) this time around I actually really enjoyed Luna, and d) Ginny's actually ok. I thought she was a wet rag the first time I read the series, and couldn't understand what Harry ever saw in her--but there are actually little tidbits scattered throughout the book that make me _kind of_ like Ginny. 7) Cho. Ugh. Teen angsty romance with an utterly personality-less love-interest. Though one of my favorite scenes of the book was, after Harry and Cho's date implodes and Harry tells Hermione about it, she explains how Harry should have insulted her and called her ugly when talking to Cho--it was actually rather sweet. 8) The payback at the end of the book was minimal, at best. The upshot of the entire book (Voldemort's attempt to get the prophecy) is that: Harry and Voldemort eventually have to fight, and only one of them will come out of it alive. Uhh...who couldn't have predicted it? Also, since the prophecy was given to Dumbledore, shouldn't he, at some point in the book, have passed along the message to Harry? (Yes, in a 20ish page monologue at the end of the book Dumbledore talks about all his mistakes, but they're pretty big for someone who is supposed to be brilliant, and I feel like much of the book was written around the monologue, not the other way around). Whew, and I planned for this to be a short review! Whoops! "},

This might make it the most important book in my life. 2016 reread: SPOILERS GALORE BELOW!Harry Potter and the Inexplicably Incompetent and Short-sighted or Else Unbelievably Manipulative Headmaster WhoU+2019s Supposed to be Looking Out for Him would be a more accurate title. Poor Harry, he really does not have a single responsible adult in his life (well, except Molly and he never heeds her advice anyway).Some random thoughts that occurred to me in the course of this reread below.Reading about St. MungoU+2019s, I have a number of questions I donU+2019t remember occurring to me before U+2013 for example, what do wizards do when they get a non-magical illness, like smallpox or pneumonia, seeing as Healers seem to only treat magical maladies? Judging by RonU+2019s reaction to doctors (U+201Ethose Muggle nutter that cut people up?U+201C) and the general poor understanding of the Muggle world among pure-blood families, they donU+2019t have a habit of turning to Muggle medicine, which would mean they have magical means for dealing with those, which poses an ethical issue U+2013 if they can treat Muggle diseases, arenU+2019t they obligated to share this knowledge with Muggles, their fellow human beings? ThereU+2019s even a specific example in the text U+2013 Arthur takes a Blood Replenishing Potion to treat his non-stop bleeding after the bite. I feel like this should definitely be something ethics would require them to share with everyone, especially considering the need for blood in the Muggle world; it would make the need for blood donations obsolete.This should be called Harry Potter: The Ungrateful Little Shit. IU+2019d forgotten what an obnoxious brat he is throughout this book, and what a low opinion he has of his friends. If it wasnU+2019t for his supreme affection and loyalty to Neville exhibited in the heartbreaking St. MungoU+2019s scene (which made me cry, again), IU+2019d have hated his guts by the last quarter of the book. It also illuminated for me just how much Harry underappreciates Hermione without whom heU+2019d have been dead at 11, not to mention failed all his exams and sent back to the Muggle world. She deserves much much more recognition than he gives her, which is barely any. And the same goes for Ron.Speaking of Hermione, another thing I notice clearly now that for some reason hadnU+2019t struck me that much before is just how ruthless she is! (ItU+2019s one of the things I love most about her tbh.) She keeps a women unemployed with blackmail and then forces her to do her job for free. IU+2019ll be honest, this is skirting the line even for me, the most diehard fan of Hermione U+2013 itU+2019s not only illegal (though Hermione has proven before she only cares for those rules that jive with her inner moral compass), itU+2019s pretty cruel. It makes you think just how much JKR loathes tabloid journalists! But it doesnU+2019t stop there U+2013 this is also the book where 16-year-old Hermione disobeys a teacher (a first for her), starts an illegal organisation in direct defiance of said teacher and the law, manipulates marginalised creatures over whom she has enormous privilege to further her political agenda (good thing she grows out of that eventually), and inflicts a permanent U+2013 yes, as in lifelong U+2013 facial disfigurement to traitors. SheU+2019d make one fearsome dictator, if she were into power U+2013 itU+2019s a good thing sheU+2019s not.Found another inconsistency U+2013 if you can listen in on other peopleU+2019s conversations in Pensieve memories even when the person whose memory it is didnU+2019t hear it at the time means any secret can be revealed if you found someone who was at the vicinity of its sharing at the time and ask them to extract the memory. Anyone could have known Remus was a werewolf for example, if they were on the grounds that day (and the entire school was) if they just entered their memory and went close enough to the Marauders.I have to say the oft-repeated criticism that the DE couldnU+2019t handle a bunch of teenagers is not true U+2013 they could, and did. They had them all defeated, and Harry with the unscathed prophecy cornered, when the Order and the Aurors arrived, and it was only after Dumbledore turned up that they were finally subdued U+2013 they had managed to murder Sirius and incapacitate Tonks and were well on their way to escape before that."},

He is also only believed by a handful of people, and so is publicly ridiculed. On top of that, heU+2019s a fifteen year old boy who feels mollycoddled and is in the pains of growing up and feeling misunderstood.Order of the Phoenix was destined to be a hostile book.Then, thereU+2019s the ever-growing presence and threat of the Ministry of Magic, who is too afraid to believe Harry and Dumbledore, and has it out for both of them. There are ridiculous Educational Decrees forcing the government into education, where it is not wanted or needed, and a new Ministry official in a teaching role - never a good idea.Dolores Umbridge is an absolute terror of a woman. She is evil, spiteful, condescending, and a villain, but a villain in the most realistic sense. While Voldemort reigns as the seriesU+2019 main baddie, Umbridge is the kind of villain Muggles encounter on a regular basis, the kind rooted in the greed and lust for power, in government brainwashing, and most of us have encountered (or will encounter) someone like her in our own lives, though maybe not to the same extent. She is the kind of person who is too caught up in herself and her beliefs, that she is blind to the opinions and truths of others, especially if they contradict her own.As my first rereading since picking up the profession of teaching, I hated Umbridge even more. The way she treats the students, as if their opinions donU+2019t matter and they cannot possibly know more than her; and the way she treats her fellow teachers, as if she, who has been teaching for mere weeks, is better than they are; is appalling. I donU+2019t blame Harry and the others for losing their temper with her, because I was doing so on my couch as well. It is also such a great parallel to education today, how government officials, who have never set foot inside a classroom, think they know more about teaching than the teachers who are there everyday, interacting with and forging relationships with the students. How a test matters more than whether or not the student has actually learned. I was shaking in fury.Of the seven books, this is the hardest to read simply because of the emotional turmoil Harry is going through. ItU+2019s his worst year at Hogwarts yet, and it seems like all his happiness is slowly being sucked away, as if a Dementor were following him around. It is hard to read him lash out as his friends and everyone who loves him, it is hard to watch him experience even more pain, it is hard to witness his loss and anger. We feel as Dumbledore does, and it is hard. I just want to take Harry and wrap him up in a big hug, make him some tea, and tell him everything will be okay. At the same time, I want to smack him because he doesnU+2019t listen to anyone. HeU+2019s hotheaded and rash, but thatU+2019s who he is.This is also one of the funnier books, despite the darkness beginning to swirl around them. Fred and George are at their best, and I loved seeing Harry take charge of the D.A., Ron take over as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team, and Hermione continue to pursue her justice for house elves (while stressing out about exams in the process!). As the core characters grow, weU+2019re also introduced to wonderful new characters (Luna! Tonks! Kingsley!), and get to see some of our favorite side characters with more to do.This book also starts to touch more on the social issues than the others, as it deals more with the rights for house elves, but it also talks more about the injustice and discrimination of half-breeds, a continuation of the discrimination of half-bloods and muggle-borns. UmbridgeU+2019s hostile opinions of half-breeds mirror those of people in the muggle world regarding race, gender, age, etc, and the way the Ministry ignores the return of Voldemort and the Daily Prophet prints only what the government wants says a lot about our society.The longest book in the series, thereU+2019s a lot going on in the Order of the Phoenix. ThereU+2019s a heartbreaking death, some laughs, blinding anger, and a bit of love and warmth. ItU+2019s not an easy read, but itU+2019s one of the best in the series."},

She sits there with her pink outfit, frog like appearance and annoyingly hollow smile and treats Harry like he is a fool. You find out how much of a disloyal, arrogant jackass Percy is, when it is written that he abandoned their family, said he was ashamed to be a Weasly and trusted the Ministry more than his own family. How he got into Gryffindor, I will never know. Anyway, back to the plot, when Harry returns to Hogwarts, you discover all of the lies that have been put into the newspaper. As a reader of the novels, it felt like I was being betrayed and ignored because I lived through Cederic's death and Voldemort's return just like Harry. I was offended, which is testimony to the amazing writing skills of Rowling. Umbride takes over the school by trying to expel students and teachers alike, and setting up her rules which made me want to strangle her. The ending of the book had me heart broken. Sirius was one of my favourite characters. He was the only family that Harry had and he was taken from our lives. Bellatrix Lestrange is one of the most well written characters I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The ending of the book closed nicely as it explained everything to the reader in a heart crushing way.Umbridge. How do i begin to describe her? Theres no other way to put it-- Umberidge is a bitch. She tortures students if they dont' follow her truth. She doesn't listen to Harry or Dumbledore who actually know what they are doing. She insults teachers and students. Shows no respect. She struts around the school deducting points from anyone who she just doesn't like. She is the worst character in existence. Written well but just so unlikable. GARAGGHHH there are not enough hateful words in existence to describe the human-toad that is Umbridge. She was going to use an unforgivable curse just to fit her well being. Her pink outfits and falsely polite gestures, her toad-smile, all contributed to my hatred to that racist old hag. Her discrimination against other races is appalling. Percy is a prick who betrayed his family. Neville is one of the bravest and strongest characters I have ever read about.This review is unbelievably long, but this book made me feel rage like I've never felt before. Order of the Phoenix is truly a literary brilliance and will definitely be re-read many enjoyable times.Categories: Fantasy, Books that will boil your bloodChallenges: None"},

So I love a lot of things about this book, in particular Harry's temper and its beautiful match-ups with Umbridge. The D.A. and the Room of Requirement are also standouts. But alas, the overall plot is the weakest so far, and this book is simply too long. While I could read hundreds and hundreds of pages more on Harry Potter, I have also come to appreciate just how much better the economical Potter books (particularly PoA) are. There's a world in which an editor removed Grawp from this edition and no one suffered (least of all Hagrid). And I have quibbles with some of the character choices, particularly with (view spoiler)[Arthur Weasley - just kill him completely! ALL FATHER FIGURES MUST GO! (hide spoiler)]. I remember being extremely disappointed when the prophecy was revealed - it's obvious, isn't it? - but the plot intricacies that the prophecy sets up ((view spoiler)[primarily Snape (hide spoiler)]) pay off. The battle with the Death Eaters at the Ministry has never felt particularly right to me, either, given that Harry and his friends are all 15 and the Death Eaters are presumably halfway competent. But the usual wrap-up conversation with Harry and Dumbledore is great.And as explored in a lengthy Twitter DM (lol) conversation with Kali and Liz over the weekend, elements of these books really do become more horrifying over time. I am officially older than all of the Cool Adults (Bill and company), and the Order of the Phoenix seems to have been made up solely of eighteen-year-olds running around getting themselves murdered. And of course, the detentions with Umbridge are insane! I watched the first half of this movie this week (before realizing that I've never watched it again because it's, you know, terrible), and it doesn't even halfway capture the Harry/Umbridge relationship.[Arthur Weasley - just kill him completely!

From \"Have a biscuit, Potter\" to lending Peeves her walking stick to chase Umbridge out of the school, she's fabulous from start to finish. As is Neville, who finally comes into his own and shows throughout that he deserves to be in Gryffindor. He may not be the best wizard in the school, but he tries his hardest at everything, and when the shit hits the fan at the Ministry, he's right by Harry's side the whole time even though he's got a broken nose and no wand. Though he may not be the Chosen One, he shows at the Ministry that he's more than he seems. 28/12/2012Dolores Umbridge is definitely the character that everyone loves to hate. I don't think I've ever met anyone who hasn't expressed a desire to be violent towards her if she were real! That said, I'm not sure that she deserves the fate that she gets. Especially when it comes at the hands of Hermione - girlfriend has a hidden dark streak! As much as I love Dumbledore's Army, Harry's tendency to act before thinking in this book means that it loses a star for me. Plus, Harry spends so much time yelling and moping and generally being a bit emo that I think I love this book more for the secondary characters. I love Fred and George and all the havoc they wreak. I love Professor McGonagall, particularly when she tells Peeves that the chandelier unscrews the other way. I love Neville, and the hidden depths that we start to see here. He's no longer the added source of comedy that he's been for so much of the series up to this point. And I love Luna. She's just fantastic. There's a lot of backstory in this one, particularly stuff (*cough* prophecy *cough*) that has a serious impact in the remaining two books. It's not my favourite by a long shot, but it's still pretty fantastic."},

He whines to Dumbledore, he yells at Hermione (and everyone else) even though she's right, and he complains that Cho cries too much... even though it's not like he's handling his grief any better.Nothing grabbed me or moved me here - I wish Harry's angst had some resolution to it or played a part in his character growth, but that mostly came in the sixth and seventh books.

The Order of the Phoenix's tone actually seems to be a fitting one for where Harry is in his life, however. He's a growing teenager, his schoolwork is becoming more strenuous, and even Rowling's writing is more mature.

The sympathy I have for all the Hogwarts-Students who have to endure her terror is just the beginning of the emotions I had while reading. This part just combines so many feelings of love, hate, anger, sympathy, laughter and sadness! But, opposed to Umbridge we also get to know very lovable characters such as Luna Lovegood, who is one reason for the \"laughter part \" of the book (another one for example is Ron being jealous of Victor Krum or protective of Ginny or Fred and George trying out their inventions for the joke shop). I just love to witness the friendship between Harry and his fellow students growing (spiked with a little romance) and am looking forward rereading part 6 and 7. By the way, next to the story I have to compliment the Bloomsbury Edition of the Series. Every book is filled with little details (such as drawings) and fun facts about the wizarding world, such as: Every Year St. Mungos Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries treats at least one injury caused by homemade floo powder.

Those scenes with Harry's bleeding hands were very hard to stomach, more so than the battle scene with Voldy and the gang. Since Hogwarts is obviously modeled on British boarding school system,that kind of unfettered sadism by a teacher towards a helpless student rang a lot truer than some of those fantastical wand battles. Wonder if Rowling got her inspiration second or first hand. (hide spoiler)]"},

It wasn't a suprise to me that every book I've read in HP series thus far, has made on my list of favorites. J.K Rowling keeps writing books that I've always wanted and look in a book. I don't know how she has done it, but it's a truly a gift.In the 5th book, we get to see Harry has truly grown increasingly mature and developed throughout the novel. Yes, he has gotten a bit of a temper which can annoyed the hell out of readers, but I can truly understand his anger and frustration. I can understand his temper because every teenager has reach a point in their lifetime where they began feeling these emotions. (I know I did) J.K Rowling did a successful job, on potraying realistic emotions of Harry and has shown his true light in the ending.This book is by far the longest book out of the whole entire series, but it's definitely worth it because there are lots of plot twists, hidden info, action scenes, and lots of parts where we least expected. It also includes a mystery and lots of hidden clues that I've come to love. In this book, we get to see the secondary characters began developing and as well as their character/personality began heightening. We see their potential, skills, and cunning and wit in battles. The secondary characters which included Ginny, Luna, and Neville all have major parts in the story which made them very likeable and unforgettable. It's truly amazing in every way.I never thought I would say this, but I feel very sorry for Snape because of his sad past that was revealed in the middle of the book. Snape has always been on my list of hated characters of Harry Potter, but that quickly changes when I've seen his good intentions. I have a good feeling I'll be seeing more of that soon.Sirius's tragic death has affected me in more ways than one. He did not deserve to end like this. His death had made me feel numb, sad, and stayed in a corner for a day, reflecting on his death and how it had affected Harry and myself. He was like a father-figure to Harry and to see this unfortunate accident happen to him was just inevitable. Sirius was one of my favorite characters, but I wasn't anticpating for this. I can't imagine what Harry feels, but I deeply feel for him since he has now lost his only godfather. R.I.P Sirius and we will be greatly missing you for your courage, bravery, and kindness to others.Lots of showdowns/duels take places between Dumbledore and Voldemort and Harry with Death Eaters. There were a lot of scenes where adreneline was bursting inside me and I was clutching the book, madly flipping the pages to know what happen next. It was just so good! (I know I keep saying that, but you get my point!)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will always be one of my favorite books out of HP series. It will always be on my shelf that will make a lasting impression on mine.Now, I'm onto reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and finish from there on."},

I am one of the Harry Potter generation. I was four when the first book was published, fourteen when the series concluded, and around the same age as the characters in the films, when they eventually came out. It's a series that I grew up with, and as such, cannot comment on its literary merits without bias. All I know is that they are a comfort, and feel like family.I still remember the agony of being in a little country where books come out long after their release in bigger countries (America, the UK, Australia). Luckily I'm pretty sure this came out only a day after the original release, but that was plenty of time for spoilers to come out, making school on the day before a harrowing experience, hiding from those cruel people determined to ruin the book. I found out the ending. The book was not ruined.When this book finally did come out, I waited in line at the bookshop for hours, and, once I had my hands on my (pre-ordered) copy, proceeded to sit at home undisturbed for six hours as I inhaled every word with both laughter and tears.

I know that there are a lot of people who dislike the angsty-ness of this book, but I think it's perfect. Harry is 15, right in the thick of his moody teen \"I'm So Misunderstood\" years, as Phinneas Nigellus is wont to point out, and I loved it. I don't mean to say that I LIKE it, because it is a tad frustrating, but I love it because it's realistic. Harry has been through more than most full-grown wizards, hell, more than some AURORS have been through, and he's left in the dark for so long that it's completely realistic that he should be frustrated and angry about it. I love this book, and I love the way that the circumstances really become real to Harry in this book. After Cedric last year, and then the Longbottoms - I mean, I know that Harry knew what happened to them last year, but really SEEING them this year had to make it tangible how dangerous Lord Thingy's supporters can be, and then Sirius solidified it.There's a lot that comes together in this book as well, most that becomes clear in the last two books, but it's starting to meld into a picture of the link that was formed that day in Godric's Hollow.

Umridge sucked eggs as I knew she would, but this one was still great. I really liked how it was longer, spending more time in the beginning before school started back up, with Harry fighting off the Dementors and having to go to trial, and the weeks spent in Grimauld Place, fending off ll the creatures inhabiting Sirius' house. I would've liked to see the house myself, all dark and creepy and stuff. Of course, I'm not a fan of Kreacher, the house elf who lacks Dobby's more up-beat personality. His constant mutterings and propensity for being loyal to the darker side of the family were not endearing, and were only made worse when he played his part in luring Harry to the Ministry for the showdown at the end. I liked following Harry and Mr. Weasley on the trip to the Ministry for Harry's trial, the whole phone booth thing was cool. Kinda secret-agent-y. I would've liked to see more, and most certainly I would've liked more info on the different departments and the different jobs. I was sort of with Harry in his anger toward everyone for leaving him in the dark and treating him like a child, but I could understand Dumbledore's reasoning. But at least Harry didn't get expelled, and Dumbledore made his first stand against nasty ol' Umbridge. Ugh, how I hate her. I had to laugh a bit at how she was constantly being likened to a big, fat, ugly toad, though I do ae to say that Imelda Staunton, who played her in the movie, did a great job at the portrayal of sugar-coated pink evil, all without looking like a toad. I was glad to finally get to 'meet' Luna (again), she's another of my favorite characters in the series. I love her 'loopy-ness' and how she just dreamily floats through life, but is not as dumb or bubble-headed as she seems. I'd totally be friends with her, lol. I'm glad The Quibbler supported Harry throughout. The whole spin that The Daily Prophet put on, denying Voldemort's return, slandering Harry and Dumbledore both, oh, just irritating! Especially because the government puts its spin on things 'released' to the public enough as it is in real life, so it sort of hits a nerve. Then for Harry to get to school and have people against him, calling him names, making things tough for him, no wonder he had some anger management issues in this episode. I'd say he's got good enough reason to be angry without even adding in that some of Voldemort's, um personality(?), attitude(?) something, is leaching into Harry through that new blood-enhanced connection. I can't say I'm a fan of angry Harry, but he has good reason to be. Then we have all these people who are in danger because the Ministry refuses to accept that Voldemort really is back, and it's compounded two-fold by Fudge's intrusion on the running of Hogwarts, basically ensuring no one will know how to defend themselves in the event of an attack. Ugh! Brings me back to Umbridge and her totally annoying self! Her insistence that the kids will never need to learn Defense Against the Dark Arts in ridiculous, even if Voldemort wasn't back, because they'd still need to know that stuff in case anyone else ever rose up all evil like that, or even for simple chores like ridding the curtains of doxys, and getting boggarts out of the dark places in your house, and etc. And on top of that, her s,army, nasty way of saying everything in that 'ooh, I'm so sweet' sort of way, ugh, I hate when people talk like that in real life. It's obnoxious. And then her little trick for Harry in detention. I'm sorry, but I side with Hermione when she said Harry should tell Dukmbledore what was going on. But Harry is tough and stubborn, and gotta love him for it. I love how the DA gets started in this one. Fabulous for some of the other kids besides Harry, Hermione, and Ron to get to learn some of this stuff, and not only learn it, but become excellent at it. Oh, man, especially Neville! He goes from no skills to awesome skills here, and I'm so happy/proud, and lol, that sounds silly because he's just a fictional character, but I just love him and want him to be awesome. I'm glad the story of his parents came out and gave him the determination and drive to master these things and make him try to fight back. Especially during the showdown at the Ministry, he did very well there, even if he did get a broken nose in the process. I wouldve liked to see what his patronus was though, just out of curiosity. I also like the whole Room of Requirement thing, I mean, seriously, a room equipped with whatever you need, when you need it? As if I needed another reason to wish I lived at Hogwarts! Then there's Hagrid's return, and the surprise he brought with him, his 'little' brother, Grawp. Sure, he was sort of scary, but I kinda hope that Hagrid 'civilizes' him a little. I mean hey, he remembered who 'Hermy' was, and was asking for Hagrid, so that's not a bad start, huh? I sort of felt bad for him when the centaurs were attacking him. And on those centaurs... I wouldn't have pictured them being such snooty creatures. I guess I sorta always picture 'em how they're portrayed in Disney's Fantasia, y'know, the part where the boy ones and the girl ones pair up all color-coordinated, and it's pretty and cute and stuff, and the black and white pegasi fly around too, and the little satyrs, and Bacchus all drunk on the wine? Lol. Ok, so that's silly of me, but hey, what can I say? So for them to get all violent was sort of a little strange. But I guess I can understand it, because after all, they have a valid argument what with the way they have been treated by the humans, like they're dumb animals or something, when in reality they are actually much smarter than the people. Discriminated against just because their bodies look part horse. I kind of like how Rowling puts these little bits of social issues in. Not saying that she's commenting on real issues, because I don't know if she is or not, I don't analyze the story when I read, I just read to enjoy the story), but I think it's good because of the younger readers, it might help them to empathize more with people who are treated badly in real life. I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. But I do like the centaurs, and could totally pull a Hermione and read books on 'em, y'know, if they were real and I lived in that world lol. On another note, after the attack on Mr. Weasley, I did like the little glimpse I got into St. Mungo's, could've happily learned much, much more about it. I had to laugh at how weird everyone thought stitches were. Too funny. But when you've got a wand and a magic word to heal your cuts, I guess the idea of sewing your skin together is rather silly. Onto the Occlumency lessons... I think Harry would've had no problems whatsoever learning how to do it if he would've had anyone besides Snape for a teacher. I mean, I like Snape, but we all know he and Harry don't get along, and for a teenage boy to set aside those feelings of anger, especially in the face of all the taunts and smack-talk he gets from Snape... well, it doesn't take a genius to see that it's not going to be an easy thing to do. If McGonagall or Dumbledore himself, or even another teacher like Flitwick or someone would've been the one to teach Harry, I think he would've mastered the skill. I don't like how Dumbledore continuously pushed Harry away in this one, though I do sort of understand his reasoning. Don't agree with him, and it's totally obvious at the end that it was a terrible idea, but I can see where Dumbledore was coming from. Snape was not a good idea for the one to be teaching Harry this skill, but I have to admit I loved getting the tiny glimpses into Snape's memory, seeing him as a sad child, being picked on and tormented by James and Sirius... I would've totally been his friend had I been there. It's really no wonder he became such a crab-apple. Ah, but I always relate to the ones who get picked on and tormented, kindred spirits. On another topic,k I have to admit here that I was glad things didn't work out for Harry and Cho. They're just... well, I don't know, not a good couple. Seeing as how I know he's gonna end up with Ginny (who I love), I just didn't want to waste time worrying about Cho. Maybe if I as the reader could've got to learn more about her as a character, it would've been different, but I never got to see more than just a few little things about her, whereas with Ginny, y'know, we get to know them so much more fully. Oh! How could I forget the Weasley twins and their totally awesome exit!? I was cheering them on, wishing I could be there wreaking havoc on Umbridge with them, making their stand. It was a rush, I was smiling as I read it. But now it's onto the journey to the Ministry. I liked how Neville and Luna and Ginny stood up and were ready and eager to join Harry, Ron and Hermione, it was great. Then, riding the thestrals in, genius. I was keen to go exploring the Department of Mysteries for myself. I wanted to know about the brains in the tanks, and the room of clocks, and the many other rooms I didn't get to see. I'm tellin' ya, I could read a million books set in this world and still want to know more, I'm insatiable! Like the curtained arch. What is it? Where'd it come from? Is it only used for executions? How old is it? Etc. Oh no, but that brings me to the most awful part of the story, I almost hate to think about it. I knew it was coming of course, but it still hit me pretty hard, I mean I literally had tears in my eyes. Not as bad as the first time I read it, but still... I mean... it was Sirius. Sirius!! Why'd it have to be him? Just so... unfair. I mean, after everything he went through, and all the hope poor Harry had, and the whole super-important relationship they had... it was exactly how Dumbledore put it, like Harry had lost a combination father/brother. The last good link back to his parents. Well, besides Lupin, who sadly isn't available as often, and wasn't Harry's godfather. I mean, I love Lupin, but, SIRIUS! Why, oh, why!? And then for Harry to find that two-way mirror from Sirius after the fact? I coulda smacked myself if I had been Harry. I mean... if he'd have remembered that he had it, he could've ensured Sirius was safe and not at the Ministry, and saved everyone a butt-load of trouble, and Sirius wouldn't be gone. I I was Harry, I'd have been feeling like the world's biggest ass at that moment. But, done bun can't be undone, and now Sirius is gone and Harry has to go on. After all, Voldemort is back, and the Ministry and The Daily Prophet can deny it no longer. That was the only good thing to come out of it. Everyone realized that Harry and Dumbledore were right all along and finally people can be somewhat informed and prepared. And that nasty ol' Umbridge is gone, woo! So with much sadness at the loss of Sirius, and yet much anticipation of (re-)finding out what's coming next, I move on to number six. I'm starting to get sad as I near the conclusion, I don't want it to end... And yet I must press on, it's too good not to."},

However, I still had a great time reading this book even though it took me way longer than all the other books have taken me. It may have been my lack of motivation to read or the book itselfU+2026I have no idea but I still did enjoy this book. Though I did have a few problems with it.THE CHARACTERSFirst of all, I didnU+2019t not care for Harry in this book. It drove me crazy how moody he was and how he let his pride get in the way of what I thought was the right thing to do. For example, why the heck did he not go to Dumbledore or McGonagall when Umbridge was straight out torturing him in detentions?! If he would have just set aside his pride and hurt feelings over Dumbledore keeping him in the dark during the summer he could have outed her absurd teaching methods. My god, Harry get over yourself! Plus, he was making me so mad that he didnU+2019t go back to Snape to resume his Occlumency lessons. Again, his pride. On top of that, he was so moody in the beginning! I get it he was feeling hurt because everyone was together and no one had told him what was going on with Voldemort or they were being extremely vague in their letters, but he kept snapping at everyone! HeU+2019s a 15 year old and I admire Jo for showing his teenage moodswings, but goodness he made it hard not to want to shake him a few times. Other than that, I still love Harry. I thought most of his actions and feelings were completely justified and my heart broke with his at the ending.Now, Hermione. My oh my, Hermione was my least favorite in this book. I have always loved Hermione even though she was a know-it-all because she was still likable in my opinion, however in this book I could not stand her attitude! Okay thatU+2019s a little harsh but she really bothered me. All her nagging were completely overboard and I just wish she would get a grip. I hated how much grief she gave over Sirius or how reckless she thought he was being when he just feeling lonely, or her attitude towards people who didnU+2019t share her empathy towards Kreacher. She just had such an awful attitude this time around and I didnU+2019t always like her.I really enjoyed the fact that we got to see more minor characters this go around. We finally got to see a little bit more Ginny (I was wondering why so many love her when for me she has just be meh) and Neville! I absolutely love Neville and I am so happy we are seeing him grow. But Luna has to be my absolute favorite. I have always loved Luna from the movies and I knew I would like her in the books and I was 100% correct. She is quirky and adorable, how can you not love her?!Also, I am really sad to have to see the twins go. I donU+2019t know how Hogwarts is going to feel without them wrecking havoc! I miss them already!Umbridge, on the other hand, surprised me. I didnU+2019t expect for her to be a little underwhelming. DonU+2019t get me wrong, I was completely annoyed by her and I thought if I had to read her interrupting U+201Chem hemU+201D one more time I would have thrown my book, but because so many hate her and go on and on how she is the worst possible character, I expected a bit more. Though I did still hate her way more than Voldemort, I admit.Oh and Snape! Gah Snape. It really bothers me how much he bullies Harry even though he knows exactly what it is like to be bullied and humiliated in front of everyone. I donU+2019t care if you are trying to save face, it doesnU+2019t give you any right. I donU+2019t feel sorry that he was bullied by HarryU+2019s dad at all. Being bullied is supposed to give you insight on how it feels and how not to treat others because you know what it feels like, itU+2019s not to make you vengeful.I wonU+2019t discuss it, but the whole Percy thing makes me sad. I have always disliked Percy but seeing how he treats his family and how that makes them feel in return just breaks my heart.THE PLOTThough a rather slow at times, the plot in this book really took the story in a whole new direction. I was completely engrossed in the story of the prophecy and canU+2019t wait to take a closer look into the connection between Harry and Lord Thingy. ;) Seeing as Harry and Voldy can how get glimpses from the other will be interesting.It was also really cool to see the coming together of the Order and how they are all rallying against Voldy.CONCLUSIONThis review may sound like I didnU+2019t enjoy the book or I had major problems with it but I still loved it. I canU+2019t not love a Harry Potter book because they are so magical and captivating. The writing is fantastic. The story is fantastic and bringing the stepping stones to a great storyU+2019s end. I missed all our beloved characters and seeing them mature is such a nice sight. I honestly canU+2019t wait to read more, even though that ending killed me into a million pieces.  I seriously had to walk away from my book because I was crying so much and I just couldnU+2019t deal. I was terrified to read HarryU+2019s reaction to Snuffles. I hate it even though I knew it was coming.Actual rating: 4.8 Full review originally posted on my blog, The Bookish Khaleesi"},

He was particularly good at making me annoyed at the characters who were being annoying. His Umbridge voice is nearly as irritating as the movie, and the part at the end with Neville was getting on my nerves it was so good. Once again making it impossible to choose between narrators.  Full ReviewI've always been torn on this book. On my very first read through, this was my least favorite. I think in retrospect it's more due to how great Goblet was (as mentioned above).The first time I read this I was 20 years old and still in college. I was much closer in age to Harry and his friends. This time, I'm 30 years old and long removed from my teenage years.I have recollections of similar thoughts and feelings to Harry, but they are just that.Overall I still enjoy this book, and on this re-read, I put it ahead of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets but probably not Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone on my ordering of the series.There are several things this book has going for it to redeem all the miserable time of Harry feeling sorry for himself. First it introduces Luna Lovegood, whose one of my favorite supporting characters.Second it introduces the DA. This is a place where Harry really comes into his own. It also gives you a reprieve (for the most part) from all of his teenage angst.Third is just how great Hermoine has become. I've always identified with her more than Harry or Ron. I like order and following the rules. I like books and the learning they can provide. I like being cautious and thinking things out. She's the voice of reason in a book full of teenage angst.Fourth is the Weasely Twins. They have what could be argued as the best scene in the series in this book. While they are people I probably wouldn't get along with too well (you tell them Hermoine!), they sure go a long way to lighten things up.And speaking of Weasely's, Ginny really finally comes into her own. She's smart and capable and moved on from fawning over Harry. The final thing I'll highlight is Dolores Umbridge. This is someone I'm torn on. She is utterly obnoxious and frustrating. However, that is the point of her character, so Ms. Rowling does a fantastic job with her. I think simply coupled with Harry's obnoxious traits, it's just a bit too much for one book. I also find her to be TOO much of an antagonist, and maybe a lost opportunity. If she was a little more like Fudge and less of a sadist, she could be a truly great villain, though maybe Rowling didn't think the subtlety of inaction would be apparent to her readers?Overall this book is uneven, and I find how much I like it seems to vary with each reading.[a broken nose (hide spoiler)]"},

Once I arrived, all of my little cousins absolutely flipped that I actually had the book and brought it with me, that they refused to quit bothering me until I read it to them. So over tI really should just make myself go and finish the last 70 pages or so of the painfully dull  Empire of Storms by Sarah J. Maas but I'm on a roll with Harry Potter rereads, so meh.Here's a funny story about this book. When It came out back in 2003 I bought a copy of it on my way to a family reunion/camping trip. Once I arrived, all of my little cousins absolutely flipped that I actually had the book and brought it with me, that they refused to quit bothering me until I read it to them. So over that week, I read the entire book to a group of 10-12 cousins between the ages of 6-10 or so. I have a very large extended family, and quite a few cousins. I've never even met some of them, and I'll be damned if I can remember how many of them there are, or even what all their names are. Anyway, as I was reading this book to them, I got the the part where Hagrid returns to Hogwarts, and this is completely true, and rather hilarious. The moment I read the words \"Hagrid's back.\" every single one of those children either groaned, or sighed. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. OF. THEM. If you can't tell, I don't really like Hagrid, and, well, apparently I'm not the only one. I like him in the first two books, but as soon as he started teaching, and bringing bigger and stupider subplots into the mix, he really started grating on me. Anyway, I remember enjoying this book, but not as much as the others in the series. However, as I reread it this time, I came to a bit of a realization. I really, really don't like this book. I mean I REALLY don't like it. So I'm going to list a few of the things that I feel were poorly done with it, and why I feel that they were poorly done. I wasn't planning to give much criticism to this series, because, for what it is, it's rather entertaining, fun and generally well put together. But man, this book. I kind of need to vent about it for a bit.There are several things that are very wrong with this book, and with the characters. Here's a list.1.) Harry is a miserable little shit.2.) All tension and drama in the story is artificially forced.3.) Every single character in this entire book is an absolute idiot.4.) Hagrid. (see above story)5.) Very large plot holes/inconsistency with the rest of the series.6.) Harry is a miserable little shit.So, okay, I've talked with people about this book, and a lot of them seem to really like it. I bring up that I felt Harry was a miserable little shit, and they tell me, oh, but he's a teenager, that's how teenagers act. Well, yes. It is, in general. HOWEVER, Harry is not actually a teenager, because he doesn't actually exist. He is a character in a story. He is the protagonist, the hero, the one we're all supposed to be rooting for, and who we're supposed to sympathize with and identify with. I understand that he's acting something like an actual teenager, BUT, as the hero of the story HE STILL HAS TO REMAIN LIKABLE AND SYMPATHETIC!!! And, well, he's not. He's a miserable little shit. He spends the entire book treating all of his friends and loved ones like garbage, whining, complaining, yelling at people he cares about, and generally being a miserable little shit because of really stupid and selfish reasons. I'm supposed to sympathize with him while he's doing that? He never even apologizes to anyone about it, or thanks anyone for trying to help him. He's being a spoiled little brat throughout the majority of this book, and he never does anything even remotely sympathetic or likable to make up for it. Honestly, after all the mouthing off he does in this book, he kind of does deserve a lot of the bad things that happen to him, his detentions, his ban from Quidditch, etc etc etc. He brought those on himself because he was being a miserable little shit, instead of using his brain and making the best of his situation.All of the tension and drama in this book are sooooooo fake and forced. This is one of my pet peeves in writing. Every single shred of tension could be resolved in this book if any character had just explained what was happening and why, and why he was not to be allowed into sensitive things to Harry in the beginning. There would be no drama at all. Harry would likely have understood and been a lot less of a miserable little shit, and that's that. I hate it when authors try to force drama into a story through a lack of communication FOR ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD REASON AT ALL!!! It comes off as very contrived. Drama that feels forced doesn't feel dramatic. Have someone explain to Harry what's happening and why at the beginning, and then let the drama come more naturally as he feels left out because of it, understanding, but still wanting to help, and not being able to. You could draw a huge parallel between him and Sirius Black, as they're in similar situations, and it really could have been a huge bonding point between them, giving Black's death a lot more impact than the zero it had in this book because the author forgot to give me any reason to care about him before killing him off. And then Harry could put all of his frustrations with being useless into forming the DA, and standing up to Umbridge, because it's the only thing he can do. There are so many better ways of creating tension and drama in this situation other than characters being assholes to Harry and refusing to give him any information. He's a teenager that has previously shown himself incapable of ignoring a mystery. What the hell did they think was going to happen? (see point 3) And again, all Sirius had to do was tell Harry what the gift he gave him for christmas was and what it was used for on any number of occasions, and everything would have turned out perfectly fine for pretty much everyone. Again, the author is forcing drama into the story through a lack of communication. It annoys me sooooooo much when authors do that. It feels so fake. A lot of people I've talked with about this book use this as an excuse for Harry's behavior in this book, but again, the drama with Harry being a miserable little shit IS ARTIFICIALLY FORCED BY A CONTRIVED LACK OF COMMUNICATION!!!And this point of every character in this book being an idiot ties in heavily with the previous one. Everyone does the stupidest thing that they can possibly do in every situation that arises in this book. Seriously. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE. Examples? Well, you've already got two right there. Hagrid bringing a giant to Hogwarts. Voldemort showing up at the ministry nine pages after it was said that to go there in person would be extremely stupid of him. Dumbledore's distancing himself from Harry. Just about everything Sirius Black does in the entire book. Every single decision that went into the whole Occlumency, or however you spell it, thing. I mean really, you put Harry with a teacher that he absolutely hates, and who absolutely hates him, and you expect him to learn anything from him, or him to teach in a way that he's going to learn? Harry and Fred and George allowing Malfoy to provoke them when they rarely have in the past. All of these things and more go into this point. Every character in this book acts like a completely idiot ALL OF THE TIME!!!Hagrid's side story in this book is just sooooooooo boring and stupid. I get that the guy doesn't have the best track record with dangerous creatures in the past, but this one seems really over the top, even for him. And it's so out of place in this book, as well. It really has no point or purpose, and goes nowhere. And it's just cringe-inducingly stupid on top of that.Did I mention what a miserable little shit Harry is in this book?Okay, every book in this series seems to have been written with no idea what comes next, and ignores everything that came before it that is inconvenient to itself. But man, this one is in a league of it's on on continuity errors with the rest of the series. You've got the small ones like \"Prefects can't take points\" except that Percy already showed that they can back in book 2 I believe. And then you go for the massive, story shatteringly large ones. Oh, like, why would Voldemort set up this elaborate scheme to get his hands on a prophecy that he had no reason to believe continued on past what was reported to him? He already knew what it said. He thought he knew the entire thing. He murdered Harry's parents because of it. Soooooooo, why is he trying to get his hands on a prophecy that he already knows? Because then this book would be about nothing. Oh... wait... Or, why would Voldemort come to the ministry in person for any reason when the entire reason behind the stupidly elaborate plot to retrieve the prophecy that he already thinks he knows in its entirety was because he couldn't show up at the ministry and reveal himself in the first place? There are more, but those are the biggest and worst ones that come to mind.I feel a little bad thrashing this book, because I remember seeing an interview with J.K. Rowling just after it came out. When she wrote this book, the pressure of how popular the series was becoming was really starting to get to her. Millions of fans were demanding the next book. Her publishers were demanding the next book. And she was so stressed out over it that she literally could not make herself write it. She was absolutely terrified of messing it up, and had a lot of problems with writer's block. She even purposely broke one of her hands with a hammer just so that she could have an actual, visible excuse that she could show people on why she wasn't working on the next book. I feel for her. I really do. I can't even imagine the pressure she must have been under while writing this book. But it's still the worst book in the series, by far, and it still has a huge mess of problems with it that kept me from enjoying it. I can be sympathetic to her situation while writing it, but I'm not going to call the book a masterpiece when it's not because of it. And fun fact, Firefox's built in spellchecker recognizes Voldemort, Dumbledore, Hogwarts, and Sirius as actual words.Did I mention what a miserable little shit Harry is in this book?Anyway, this book, unfortunately, is a crucial part of the story and cannot be skipped without missing a lot that isn't readily explained in the next book. I feel that it really is the worst book in the series, and I had a pretty miserable time forcing myself through it this last time. Of course, there are six other books in the series that are excellent, so don't let one bad book in the middle throw you off the whole series. The rest of the series is really fun and entertaining. It's just this one that's not very good. Honestly, this is one of those very few times where I feel that the movie is actually better than the book. Harry is made a lot less angsty and a lot more sympathetic in the movie, and a lot of the continuity errors with other books in the series are removed or glossed over in such a way that they're irrelevant. And Hagrid's side story is cut down to a far less annoying length. "},

I'm talking, of course, about the ending, with Sirius' death, with Dumbledore blaming himself because he didn't give Harry the full story of why Voldemort was after him, and with Harry's realization that Kreacher lied to him, and that his own unkindness to Kreacher probably didn't help things. That's not to say that any of them are to blame - it's a combination of things that led to Sirius' death - but it's a hard lesson for anyone to learn that their heroes are not perfect, and it's one that feels earned after a book full of stealthy secrets. I was chatting with my husband and he felt that OotP was the downfall of the series because nothing really happens in the books that advances the Voldemort issue. I disagree, though - this time around, I actually think it's incredibly realistic that a terrorist like Voldemort would need to take time to amass his followers, working in stealth, building things up so that he can strike at just the right moment. And while it's true that you only get real advancement of the overall mystery at the end of the book, there is a lot of set-up here for the last two books. There's also a lot more growing up/puberty stuff than before. Ginny's dating. Harry goes out with and makes out with Cho Chang. We start to see a lot more of the kids in the other houses, which makes sense with the way the world is expanding to Harry. Speaking of Harry, on my first read, I remember thinking that he spends a lot of time as an angry, angsty teenager. And that's definitely true - he blows up at Hermione and Ron way too many times during the book, but I think I had a lot more sympathy for him this time around - if you had been through what he had, wouldn't you be angry that you were a marked man and you were constantly in danger? It's exhausting and completely stressful! What's interesting is how Harry deals with that anger and what choices he ends up making towards the end of the book and at the beginning of the sixth book - he deals with Sirius' death a lot better than he dealt with Cedric's, and he learns more about acceptance and bravery than he ever did. I do think that the book could have been a bit shorter - I don't feel we needed that much detail about the OWL classes, Harry seeing the corridor in the Department of Mysteries, etc, but at the same time, at this point in the series, with such a complex world, I love all the little details and extras that JK Rowling gives us. It might be too detailed, but as a total Potterhead, I was into it. And don't tell me that the amount of detail at the end wasn't amazing - the Department of Mysteries was FASCINATING - the brains? The veil? And yes, the epic battle between Dumbledore and Voldemort? Wow. Suffice to say, I think this is a pretty solid entry into the Potterverse, and I'm already on book six. =p "},

Sometimes I even consider it my favorite depending on my mood at the time. I personally love Harry's angst in this one; it's the kind of angst that is completely justified what with all of the things that he has to deal with. The dementor attack in Little Whinging, Dumbledore ignoring his existence for months even avoiding eye contact with him, Dumbledore keeping him isolated from any news or the fact that he was being watched, Umbridge in general, Snape's usual taunts with the addition of the occlumency lessons that turn out to be nothing less than emotional and mental torture in his hands. The list can go on and on for days. I also would like to point out the parallel of Harry and Sirius in this book. They're both incredibly moody; the people in charge won't let them participate and be involved in the way they want to; both of them are kept in a place they despise, in Sirius's case its his parents old house that he ran away from and hoped to never see again, and in Harry's its Hogwarts with Umbridge torturing him in detention and her lessons, banning him from Quidditch, Hagrid being gone for months, and the fact that he was unable to speak to Sirius; Snape taunts both Harry and Sirius at every given opportunity, calling Sirius useless to the Order as he is stuck at Grimmauld Place, and calling Harry an attention seeker for wanting the dreams that he is supposed it be using occlumency against to continue.I don't even want to imagine the scene in which Sirius discovered that Harry was in danger before he took off with half of the Order to save them. By the time we get to the department of mysteries, both Harry and Sirius are at their temperament's end what with everything they've had to put up with all year and they are both feeling reckless, not to mention terrified, when they discover one of the people that they care about the most in this world is in danger. Of course, true to character, both of them take off to save the other; one with severe deliberate misinformation and the other with a desperate need to not only save his godson, but to prove to everyone as well as himself that he's not useless. One of the things I love the most about Sirius and Lupin is that they're willing to treat Harry with respect and not like a child. They know what he's been through and they think he deserves to know what's going on when it comes to Voldemort. They care greatly for him and understand that he needs to be kept informed in some way or he'll explode. This books always kills me, more than probably any other book that I've ever read, for many reasons. The obvious one to anyone who knows me being that Sirius Black is my favorite fictional character of all time and for those of you who've read this, you know the last few chapters of this book are absolutely heart wrenching. I actually never continued on with my Harry Potter reread this past Christmas because I was once again so upset and traumatized by the end of this book that I never picked up or got through my reread of Half Blood Prince. I was in mourning. ~"},

Most unfortunately, that was when they had just published the translation of HP5, so the very first fantasy I read is the first chapter of HP5.Couldn't have chosen anything worse. This whole volume is full of the whining ego of this jerk called Harry Potter. He ceaselessly complains why people don't pay more attention to him at a time when the Super Evil Overlord returns (oh, why indeed!) Just because you're an orphan, people don't have to fawn over you to make up for the years you lost, do they? And just like Hermione diagnosed, he's only too eager to act heroic, always thinks too high of himself. He struck me as dull, pathetic, arrogant, nosy, reckless, and above all, stupid beyond measures. He blunders around, never really cares or thinks what the consequences might be, and that others might have to clean the mess after he's done having tantrums.(The first time Harry broke into Umbridge's office to contact Sirius has the most ridiculous excuse that's ever been made up. So he risked being expelled and even the location of the Order to tell Sirius that he knew the gang had bullied Snape? That's it? That's the lamest excuse - ever!And there's another thing: so that was true that his dad was in fact an ass and Snape had every reason to act crazy, and Harry was decidedly mad with Snape still? Hey Rowling, you lost me there. I just couldn't get it. Are we mad at someone when we know they were treated like vermin?)Of course, that is exactly the point because JKR wanted to create an exemplary teenager. It's just that she overdid it. She created the only obnoxious protagonist among highly agreeable supporting cast I've ever read. Now I know why I shunned fantasy all those years. Quite understandable, to quote Professor Dumbledore. It was all because of this book!

I just can't get over how unreasonable and vindictive and petty and just plain old NASTY he is to Harry. 3. Poor Hermione's parents. Does she EVER see them and spend time with them?

Also descriptions feel very fake, since they are not done through internal monologue or an unseen narrator. Rowling, when a person describes something with free speech, he doesnU+2019t sound as if he is reading his school essay. Free speech is supposed to be messy and unorganized up to a point. You instead made Hagrid to talk like a robot when he was describing his visit to the giants.No securitySecurity continues not to exist. There is a weird spy system that allows you to know when someone is casting a spell anywhere in the non-magic world. Literally, you scratch your ass with magic and in five seconds an owl will arrive telling you to go to court because of the crime you just committed. Yet for some reason, this system works only with humans. If any other creature uses magic, the genius magic police will accuse the wizard closest to that point. Meaning, all you have to do in order to incriminate someone, is order a simple house elf to cause havoc in his house. Or even better, have a life sucking fiend to attack him. He will either die, or use a spell to defend himself, in which case he will go to prison. Such a fair and reasonable system.Remember that impregnable prison that every year someone always escapes from? Now EVERYONE escaped from it! And when I say everyone I mean everyone. INCLUDING THE BAILIFFS!!! I am not kidding, those life sucking fiends from the third book which were used as prison guards, instantly join VoltemortU+2019s side and free all his allies the second they find out he is back. Essentially they were wolves guarding the sheep. And of course none of the millions of wizards in the entire magic world did the slightest thing to stop them or at least managed to find out where they all went to. I guess they thought the evil fiends were more than enough for protecting themselves from evil wizards.In response to this event, the brilliant ministry of magic announces that Voltemort does not exist and that all events in the past four books are mass hysteria or some nonsense. Then it orders all schools to stop teaching offensive spells, so nobody will be able to defend himself against the evil wizards. Then leaves internal security to the Slitherin faction, which all happen to be evil wizards. And every adult wizard is fine with that, as if itU+2019s not like they just handed over all the power to Voltemort. Which, what a surprise, they did, since the ministry, the most secure place in the world, became the Big BadU+2019s headquarters. And of course nobody suspected a thing, since the security of the magic world is impregnable, as proven so many times over the past books. But hey, itU+2019s not like Voltemort did a better job when he took over, since when Harry infiltrated the ministry, he did it just as easily.And itU+2019s not just Harry. Despite the new super strict rules, the elite adult wizards were still incapable to protect the school from being constantly vandalized by a bunch of rookie students. I mean, holy shit, a student casts a simple firework spell and they have no idea how to dispel it. They have enough power to blow up buildings but canU+2019t deal with cantrips.Hell, itU+2019s not even about magic; adults couldnU+2019t even deal with simple non-magic related issues. Even the most careful of the bunch, that crone of a witch that was the leader of security, was dumb enough to believe some kids who were clearly against her, and went to look for someone, all alone in a dangerous forest. Was it really a surprise that she got ambushed? But hey, teen empowerment fantasy excuses very reasonably why adults are dumbasses, while teenagers can do anything.And since we are at the topic of security, I might as well question why is Harry still living with his foster parents. The excuse of his aunt being a battery to his plot armor spell is no longer working, because Voltemort drank his blood in the previous book. He shouldnU+2019t be allowed to return there. In fact, he was attacked by a fiend because the wizards didnU+2019t take him to a magic family. Instead of that, they send him to court for warning them about Voltemort and casting a spell to save his life. Adults are useless.Misdirected fameSpeaking of Harry, his legend grows even further! Adding to greatest hero for doing nothing, savior of all oppressed people for doing nothing, and champion of Hogwarts for cheating all the time, now he also becomes the secret leader of teen rebels, out to fight the evil adult authorities. Catering your audience more directly, I see. He is even chosen to be their teacher for offensive spells, something which makes absolutely no sense, since he is not allowed to study magic at home, and thus knows less about spells than a 10 year old who is allowed to study magic at home. And yet Rowling tries to make it seem as if, besides Harry nobody in Hogwarts learned a single offensive spell in five years, even though they were constantly practicing since the very first book and already knew a dozen spells in their first year alone. Rowling, just how stupid do you take your audience to be if you honestly believe nobody is going to notice that? Also, why is everybody going to a magic school if they donU+2019t learn how to use magic?Destiny bullshitAnd if you thought his fame stops growing there, you are mistaken, because he is also revealed to be The Chosen One! ThatU+2019s right, there is a prophesy about saving the world from evil. Ok guys, we might as well stop reading since we now know what will happen at the end. You can thank Rowling for spoiling the outcome and killing all the excitement. If that was supposed to make Harry look even more of an empowerment fantasy than he already was, it sure backfired. But look on the bright side; now we know why Harry was winning all the time without doing anything. There never was a chance for him to lose! It was his destiny to win, even by doing absolutely nothing. Believing in yourself and training hard? Fuck you, all it takes is to be the chosen one.Retarded magic namesThe final confrontation is between the rebellious youths and the evil wizards, where over a hundred spells are cast. It could have been one hell of a battle, if it was full of martial art choreography and cool incantations. But no, all they do in the battle is standing still and yelling one-word spells. Said names are just what the spell does with an added ous at the end to make it sound more interesting, so all you get is people yelling U+201CStupidious! Blockus! Immobilous! Reversus! Scratchmyassus! Hemoroidus!U+201D That is completely lame.Plot armorAnd it doesnU+2019t even matter, since once again Harry did nothing and got saved by the archwizard appearing out of nowhere to save his ass. And donU+2019t go asking how he got there. He was wanted, hiding for most of the book, and just teleports in the most convenient moment and in the most secure place in the world, which also happens to be the place where everybody plans to kill him on sight. I told you magic is panacea. Anything can happen.And itU+2019s not like removing the magic would negate all plot armor, since Rowling is completely incompetent to write a smart character who can escape with tactics and wits. Earlier in the book, Harry was attacked by centaurs in a forest, and got saved once again, without doing anything, by a giant who for some reason was not seen by the centaurs all these days despite being huge as a hill and living in their homeland. Said giant, somehow heard some noises from afar and rushed to save the kids in the most convenient moment. Something which makes no sense, because giants in this setting are violent, selfish and stupid creatures who donU+2019t care about humans, other than stepping on them for fun. Yet this giant, who some days ago wanted to eat Harry alive and trashed a hundred trees just because he was bored, remained unnoticed by the centaurs who cherished and protected the forest, and magically heard a noise from the other side of the horizon, and ran all the way there in seconds without being noticed, despite his size and the shaking of the ground. His sole purpose for doing that was to save a friend he never met. HarryU+2019s plot armor is so big, he instantly becomes friends with violent giants he never met, and makes them teleport from the other side of the planet just to save his ass. Well done Rowling, this is good writing.Uninteresting deathThe book ends with the death of a secondary character, which left me completely uninterested since he was absent for most of the previous books. It would be emotional if was constantly next to Harry after the third book but because of that ridiculous scene where they let the guilty guy escape because he forgot to take his medicine, I just didnU+2019t give a shit about him. Also, why would I feel sorry for the death of a character, when they can use the time machine to prevent it?"},

It's a huge book. It's a proper tome. My original copy literally split in half under its own weight.And, I brought up in my review of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that I just see this series as two distinct trilogies. So, this book is the first of the second trilogy. (If that makes any sense.) Like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone did, it has to set the stage for the rest of the series. That tone, that feel. All what's going on and what is really driving it.This book is hardly perfect. There are things that should have been edited out for conciseness, such as Hermione's S.P.E.W. venture or the relationship with Cho. It didn't add to the plot, just the characters, both of whom were very strong by this point in the series. And, then things could have been drawn together tighter so it made sense. The five stars I give this is purely on a loving level, and I think that there's infinite things to draw from in this series.Again, I focused a lot on Dumbledore during my reading. It's such a shame that the more I see of him, the more disillusioned I become. However, I'm going to focus the bulk of my review on another character. A truly beloved one.Whenever someone talks about this book, they point out certain things. Harry's angst or Umbridge in general. Then, there's the obvious. Sirius's death. I remember growing up, talking with my nerdy friends about this. They would talk about how upset they were at his death, how they cried and wailed and blah blah blah. I sort of stared at them and then, wanting to fit in, made my own story up for a reaction.I never cried. I never got upset. The most I was upset was feeling for Harry in that moment, not at all for Sirius. Just Harry. Even when I was younger, I felt something was wrong with Sirius. I understood he was supposed to be a parental figure for Harry. I understood that we were supposed to find him a bit flawed, yet love him for it. But Sirius and I never clicked. It wasn't until years later that I finally knew why it was that I didn't like him. Not that he's a child. I get that, too; Azkaban stopped his mind from maturing, so he's stuck at a specific age. Not that he mistakes Harry for James. Another thing I get; he misses his friend desperately, all the fun they had, and he projects it onto Harry.No, it was how he treated people.JK Rowling wrote it best: \"If you want to know what a man's like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.U+201D And... how does Sirius treat his inferiors? Take a good look at Kreacher. He treats that poor house elf like he's not even worth the dust on his feet. He treats him awfully, and why? What does he gain from it? Nothing. When he's with his \"equals\", we all know how he's like. Amiable, hilarious, sweet, loving.Another example. Look at how he treats Snape. For years, he perceived Snape as an inferior to his. Unlike James, he didn't really move on from his boyhood hatred -- and I will forever wish JK shows us how James moved on and wooed Lily, because I want to know. The two of them didn't, but Snape will be featured another time for me to vent my opinions over him.Sirius is as bad as Snape is. And, I will always make my feelings known that I don't like Snape. At all. The only thing that keeps Sirius from really being Snape is that he likes Harry. He treats him well, so we're supposed to root for him over Snape. Literally, that's it. That's the only difference, really, in their character. Look at how Snape treats Neville and compare to Sirius and Kreacher.And, that is why I will never be able to like Sirius Black. I can appreciate his character. I can feel happy that Harry actually had a proper parental figure, albeit a flawed one (as all parents really are). I can forever hope that he, wherever he goes after he dies, realizes what he did was wrong. However, I cannot like Sirius Black."},

She's really extraordinary.  \"You're just as sane as I am.\" U+2014 Luna LovegoodSchool is much more stressful for the characters than it normally is. The pressure Harry, Hermione, and Ron feel towards their O.W.L. exams is exactly how I feel towards my studies at the moment.  \"Ask us no questions and weU+2019ll tell you no lies, Hermione.\" U+2014 Fred WeasleyFred and George are legendary! They also invented loads of things like the Skiving Snackboxes, Trick Wand, and other stuff for pranks. In this book, they had gone full-on pranksters and inventors at Hogwarts. It was for a good cause, to rebel against Dolores Umbridge U+2014 that part was utterly badass.Speaking of rebels, why didn't Harry include some Slytherins in the Dumbledore's Army? Was it because of their reputation? I'm sure they are not all evil. I never liked the fact that there is a diversity between Slytherin and all the other houses. It's not fair.There is a part where Harry and George got mad at Malfoy after winning the Quidditch game. Well, it's not like George to lose his temper like that. It's quite hot actually.  \"Ron, you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.U+201DU+2014 Hermione GrangerWEASLEY IS OUR KING!I loved that part, because it was shown that Ron is indeed lionhearted. People ought to know that. One of the thousand things I wish they included in the movies is the St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. The chapter \"Christmas at the Closed Ward\" was so heart-wrenching. Harry, Hermione, and Ron's encounter with Neville Longbottom's parents made me cry.In this book I have also realized that I don't like James Potter much. I'm talking about the younger version of James, when he was a bully. I didn't like that at all. On the other hand, Dad version of James seems okay. But overall his character did not make it on my top favorites list.I already mentioned this in my other reviews, but yeah, I really hate Cho Chang.Wow Kreacher was a jerk. He hurt buckbeak! Nobody should get away with hurting innocent animals.Speaking of the characters I'm not exactly fond of, there's one I really hate to the bones. Dolores Umbridge. (Don't we all?) She is pure evil. Even though the story turned a notch darker compared with the previous books in the series, I still loved reading this."},

He felt sad for that family. He glances the other way and sees Cho making out with some guy in Hogwarts. He remembered how she used to blush and how they kissed and how she betrayed him. But in reality, Harry didn't feel anything. As he finally looks up, he sees Voldemort, standing with also his hand holding the unique wand. Harry wonders what its made of and what if its better. Then he looks at him, skin as white as snow, no nose. This now reminds him of Cedric playing Edward in the breaking dawn movie he just watched yesterday. Damn! Bella is hot. Harry goes dreaming but then comes back to reality that he has to face him. Voldemort was looking happy but also afraid. Why afraid? He is the Dark Lord. I am just a very unlucky kid. Then Harry says the spell. Avada kedevra. He remembers Voldemort saying this a year ago. How he regrets hes the boy to be vs him.\" Now heres a short simple version. \"Harry picked up his wand, looked at Voldemort and said, Avada Kedevra.\"Where was the editor? I could have summed this book to 350-400 pages. Now can you see why it was so long and slow?Too annoying and boring?I really like Harry, but in this book I was so annoyed by him. He whines, hes angry, he shouts and then after realizing that the people hes shouting at are the world to him, he is sorry and then the next day? Repeat.I would have preferred Ron's POV any day. Ron has:1) Awesome twin brothers, Fred and George and older brothers too.2) Nice parents.3) A hateful brother. (Percy)4) Prefect badge.5) Hermione.6) Quidditch match to play.7) And a sister who keeps on getting boyfriends.Harry has:1) Anger issues.2) Voldemort.3) Sirius, the only exceptional character I liked with Harry and now hes dead too.Many readers here read this series as their first book or soon after watching the movie or soon after started reading books or are just a die hard Harry Potter fan. But for me? When I was young I was too scared by the sizes of the book so I decided I will read this series after the last movie is released and at that time I would be older too. So after reading hundreds of books about witches, vampire and shape shifters, I just find Harry Potter okay. While people are like, \"OMG! HP is the best series ever!\" I am like, \"HP is just like any other series.\"As others I am just reading this book so I could finally read the last book, because readers do say it was epic and also watch the last movie part-two. Overall this book was just fine and I would rate it 3/5 stars. Just two more books to go! ^_^"},

We can start seeing more of the puzzle pieces coming together and hints to what is coming, such as Petunia talking about that awful boy and the locket at Grimmauld Place. Harry is depressed in this novel which makes reading this one not as fun as the previous books, and I do have to agree with Hermione and Lucius Malfoy that Harry does love playing the hero and it does start to grate on me. While I think their relationship is sweet and awkward I am not a fan of Cho as I think she is dull. Rereading this I had forgotten about Firenze becoming divination teacher. I feel very sorry for Neville, because I would much rather my parents died quick and clean than what happened to NevilleU+2019s parents and I feel he should have had more sympathy.However two people I really donU+2019t like are James and Sirius as they were jerks and while I donU+2019t know if Snape was just as bad, they were bullies and it does not matter about their age, if anything bullying affects people the most at that age. Also they remind me of the boys at school who behaved very badly at school but always got away with it. On the other hand, I really hated Umbridge as she was the most relatable baddie in the series, and turns what is HarryU+2019s only home he has known into somewhere he does not enjoy being. One thing I never got is why the order never used muggle technology, for example phones, as it is much quicker than owls and Voldemort and his Death Eaters would never expect it. Also how did Harry get the marauderU+2019s map as last we knew fake Moody had it and we never heard about him getting it back. Similarly, Harry should have been able to see the Thestrals since he was one year old when the first person he saw die was Lily, not Cedric. While Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix is probably one of my least favourite of the Harry Potter series I still love it and would recommend it to anyone who has read the first four books.This and my other reviews can be found at Amethyst Bookwyrm"},

I just loved it. Is amazing how J.K. Rowling have this dark humor when something wasn't right in the book, *SPOILER ALERT* like when they're in the Ministry of Magic, and they were running away from the Death Eaters and Ron was acting like he was dope or something (that was funny, i admit that i laughed), well, I think that one of the best examples for dark humor.Now, I will say that, I love Luna Lovegood akshsja she reminds me when I don't know what to do with my life or just when I'm just boring (lol). Btw, i think the worst character in this book, besides most of the Death Eaters and Voldemort, is Dolores Umbridge. That women is so wrong in life, I mean, she is the worst of the worst. Ugh. I don't even want to remember her. Eww. And the last thing... Is that I love Harry, Hermione, Ron and Neville as always. I wish I could say more in this review about this amazing book, but I already give to many spoilers (one but that's too much), sorry. P.S.: I will not talk about the death of the people in this one, is too sad, no. I even suffered with Harry. No. And, one question, am I the only one who hated Cho since the first time Harry talked with her? Or I'm just crazy?5 stars because I loved it! It was dark, funny, mysterious, and lovely as all the books. "},

(Thank god for the movies)Unlike The Goblet of Fire when the only dark parts were the dark mark and Voldemort coming back, this book really had a dark side to it. This book is the turning point to the darkest side to Harry Potter's world. Of course, The HP books to have some darkness to them, but being in Harry's mind during the order of the pheonix, you can't actually do anything than sob and feel sorry for the kid. I did highly enjoy the book, even though it was very long, and did have some dragging parts. I understand and am glad most of the unnecassary parts were cut out of the movie. The book is ridicolously detailed with darkness and wrath. Mostly Harry's wrath. Umbridge was a bitch, a horendus, hideous, big fat bitch! I hated her so much in the movie but when I read her character in the book, she just got worse! Dredding to the last chapters, I just had to drag the waiting, but when the time finally came I was in tears, during Sirius's death and Harry's pain toward Dumbledore. Oh dear. I kind of dredd reading the last two now."},

Now facing a hearing at the Ministry of Magic and possible expulsion from Hogwarts, he is brought to number 12 Grimmauld PlaAfter another summer spent stuck at his aunt and uncle's house in Little Whinging, Surrey, Harry is chafing and tense waiting for Lord Voldemort to make his move. But there's nothing in either the wizard news or the Muggle news. Then late one day he and his cousin, Dudley, are attacked by Dementors and Harry is forced to break the under-age use of magic law to defend them. Now facing a hearing at the Ministry of Magic and possible expulsion from Hogwarts, he is brought to number 12 Grimmauld Place in London, ancestral home of his godfather, Sirius Black, and new headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix. The Weasley family is living there, as is Hermione, but Harry only feels more resentful and angry at being left out and kept ignorant. Isn't he the one who saw Voldemort return to full strength and kill Cedric Diggory? Isn't he the one who battled him and escaped to return and warn everyone that Voldemort had returned?But now that he's back in the wizarding world, he learns that the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge, is denying it all and making Harry look attention-grabbing and even insane: \"Potty Potter.\" Dumbledore, too, is being vilified for insisting the Dark Lord is back and they must be prepared and united to fight him. In their attempt to control Dumbledore and Harry, the Ministry instates one of their own, Dolores Umbridge, in the cursed position of Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. While Voldemort takes over Harry's dreams at night, Umbridge is determined to ruin his life by day.This is probably my favourite of the series. I love how involved and detailed it is, how it gets immersed in life at the school, and how complex the world has really become. It feels so real to me: Harry, his life, his world. It's also, I find, the most emotionally rich (with the possible exception of the final book, but I've only read that one once so far so I'm not sure). Not only is Harry continuing to mature and grow and is very true to his age - Rowling writes with exceptional skill and nowhere is this more apparent than in bringing Harry to life in each book, a whole year older.This book is all love to me. Yes it's the longest and perhaps the slowest in the series, but it's actually extremely eventful and busy. There's A LOT going on here, and it's a more, shall we say, \"adult\" plot. One of my favourite lines is when Sirius says to Harry, the world isn't divided into good people and Death Eaters. It's an important distinction for Harry to really learn and understand, especially as in every book he suspects Snape and he's always wrong. Here, he was thinking Umbridge was in league with Voldemort, because she's so awful and cruel, and that's when Sirius tries to explain that the world isn't that straight-forward. It marks Harry's real turning point, leaving childhood and a lingering belief and trust in adults (anyone other than Dark Lord supporters and his relatives) behind. It's not that this wasn't clear to us in the previous books, but until the ministry itself turned on Harry and Dumbledore, he had a naU+00EFve trust that the truth always wins. Now, he learns that people can have complex motivations and their own agendas.Umbridge in particular teaches him this harsh lesson. She's a wonderful character, absolutely horrible with no redeeming feature but with a scary certainty that she's in the right. People as inflexible as Umbridge are always dangerous characters in fantasy, and Umbridge takes the cake. Rowling paints a vivid portrait of her, appearance-wise, and it really sticks in your head. Inherently racist, Umbridge has a fear of half-breeds and an arrogant belief in the superiority of wizards and witches over all humans and non-humans alike; add to this her position of power and she becomes quite the enemy. She may be an obvious character (Rowling clearly had some fun in making her so absolutely horrid), but she's sadly representative.Alongside Umbridge, who's a favourite of mine (you just love to hate her!), other things in this fifth book that I love include the thestrals, the skeletal winged horses that only people who've seen death can see; the showdowns between Umbridge and the other teachers; getting an intimate glimpse into Neville's life; Snape's memories from his own days as a student at Hogwarts; the battle at the Department of Mysteries; Fred and George Weasley's send-off mayhem; and the DA meetings. In a way, this instalment gives us some breathing space in the series, especially after   Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, in terms of adventure, yet it's also hugely important in terms of not just the over-arching plot (Harry finally learns the truth about his connection to Voldemort), but in terms of Harry's own personal development.It's also really sad - actually, books 4 to 7 all end sadly, with a death and some hard-hitting stuff. I always felt that the death here was the worst, because it's so personal and so unfair - is Harry never to have family to love?The violence in this book really struck me - it's not that there wasn't danger and a lot of hexes thrown around in the previous books, but somehow here the stakes are so much higher, the spells that much more vicious. It's not just hexes and jinxes to bring on sudden deformities, like those the students inflict each other with, but grown and experienced Death Eaters directing killing curses at Harry and his friends. Those scenes are filled with tension, suspense, danger, and since Cedric died in the previous book, it feels like no one is safe anymore. And I felt absolutely awful for the \"baby-headed Death Eater\", especially as I had my own 3-month-old asleep on my lap at the time and since becoming a mother, the cries of the floundering, panicking, scared baby-headed Death Eater was really quite upsetting. This was also a real \"kick me\" story, like when Harry unwraps Sirius' present at the very end of the school year to find a kind of two-way magic mirror with which he could contact Sirius - if only he'd unwrapped it earlier and he would never have been lied to by Kreacher!! I also felt anger at Dumbledore for not being honest with Harry: why should he expect a boy to take occlumency lessons from someone he hates - Snape - without telling him why it's so bloody important? At least Dumbledore apologised and told Harry everything at the end; he became human in that moment, and remains a kind of surrogate father-figure.On a side note, it suddenly occurred to me while reading this big fat book that in all the Harry Potter books, I've never come across a typo. No typos, no missing articles, not even a \"ay\" instead of \"lying\" or a \"lead\" instead of \"led\". And trust me, if they're there, I always find them. So well-done to the proof-reader, I wish more books were this clean.When I finished reading this book for the third time, I watched the movie which I hadn't seen since it came out in the cinema. I remembered Imelda Staunton (wonderful actress) playing Dolores Umbridge to perfection, and the DA meetings were captured so well - I loved how the Room of Requirement vanished for those who weren't members of the DA, which it didn't do in the book. I remember thinking, the first couple of times I read the book, that I really really wanted to see Snape's memories in the film, but I had misremembered and thought it wasn't included, so seeing it there - even if it was quick - was a nice surprise. But I wasn't satisfied with Michael Gambon's representation of Dumbledore - he seemed so angry and even bitchy, and not as in-control as he is in the book, nor with the kind of sense of humour Dumbledore's always displayed.I never expect - or want - book adaptations to be exact replicas of the book; they need to bring something new, and they need to adapt to a different medium. But with a book of this size and scope full of so much detail, it is sad to see what they decided to leave out, or condense, in order to make it work as a film that's not too long. I'm definitely a bigger fan of the books than the movies."},

Rowling was trapped by her desire to stick to the formula of one book per school year. While sometimes artificial constraints enhance the creative process, in this case the effect is the opposite. Voldomort comes back at the end of book 4. Do we really need a whole and very fat volume till we get ready for the real confrontation? And speaking of a fat volume: Rowling's editors are way too deferential at this point, and let the author indulge herself with endless repetitions. Do we really need to stop at every floor in the ministry of magic? Do we have to be told what's on every floor of Saint Mungo's? When Hagrid leads Harry and Hermione through the forest, one gets the feeling 5 Quidditch matches could hvae been played during that interminable march. The climactic scene in the department of mysteries goes on and on and on, as the author tries to outdo herself with \"interesting\" rooms to visit. Instead of being thrilling it becomes tedious. The final confrontaion is anti-climactic. In short the book is a big fat fail, and 50% could have been cut out without any loss. In fact, if it wasn't for the one year a class constraint, the whole of this book could have taken up just a few chapters and we should have moved right into what is now book 6. I already had started losing interest in the series in the previous volume and in fact never got around to reading this volume and the subsequent ones when they were published. But recently, being a huge fan of the man, I decided to listen to the series through the Stephen Fry audiobook readings. His interpretation alone would have me add one star to my ratings of all previous volumes. But for this book, he only managed to carry me through. Had I been reading the text I never would have managed to finish. I'm glad I did, as I have started book 6 and it is already much improved as Rowling finally ditches the trite formula of the opening of the previous 4 books and varies (albeit only slightly) the whole Harry suffering at the Dursleys, being saved by the Weaselys dynamic. So while I can't recommend this book, you have to get through it to move on. So I strongly recommend everyone isten to the Fry audiobook version of the series. He truly brings the book to life, not to mention slyly making explicit the homoerotic undertones of various situations and characters (not least of which HP himself in his unrequited love of Ron). In any case, I would never have been able to finish the series without the help of the inimitable Mr. Fry.****Spoiler AlertIn a related note, this book also underscores why the series as a whole is a failure despite Rowling being an extremely imaginative and talented writer. She never makes up her mind whether she wants the book to be fairy tale or myth. As the series progresses it gets darker and darker, with all the dead bodies piling up. But the classic myth of the hero has the main character learn about himself as he slays the dragons and demons he is forced to confront. He becomes a richer and more human character, as he discovers the world is not black and white but highly nuanced. Rowling can never seem to let Harry truly learn and mature because she herself seems to want to see the world in black and white. The climactic scene where Harry see's Snapes worst memory, for example, starts out as a potential moment for Harry to have a richer and more nuanced view of his father, Sirius and Snape. Instead, by the end of the book he is once again blaming Snape for Sirius' death! And his whole reaction to that (utterly unmoving) death is so over the top and childish. No real hero in the mythical sense, who has gone through what Harry did in the past 5 books would react in so unseemly and ridiculous a fashion. In general, the portrayal of Harry as some 15 year old teenager who is a victim of his hormones is an insult to all teenagers, most who are far more sophisticated than HP. In general, Harry, Ron and Hermione are unpleasant and one dimensional characters. They never seem to change, never learn from their mistakes, have no real compassion and in fact with their own prejudices and actions show themselves to be not much different than the death eaters they so despise.Even Tolkien, who has been so criticized for his one-sided portrayal of Mordor, allows his characters to mature, become more nuanced and more real. Rowling seems to be afraid to frontally confront the ambiguity of human nature, and so shrinks back from following her story to its human conclusions. For example, she wants us to believe, along with Harry, that despite his flaws Sirius is really the wonderful godfather Harry desperately wants, instead of a haughty Black who (most likely to spite his family) hates Deatheaters instead of Mudbloods, and is not really much different than his mom. He and all the rest would be far more interesting and human characters, if Rowling didn't keep pulling back from the ambiguity of what it means to be human."},

I've read reviews of people complaining about Harry \"always bitching\" and being \"an ungrateful shit\" to which I can only respond with: did you realise that at the time the order of the phoenix takes place Harry has JUST witnessed the murderer of his parents (one of the most powerful wizards of all time) kill an innocent boy in front of him and almost murdered Harry himself and that Harry 1) blames himself for what happened to cedric2)was left alone to live with his abusive family.for months. Without receiving news from anyone not even the people he loved and trusted the most like no offense but Harry James Potter deserves so much better I would die for that kidAnyway so yes his outburst was 100% justified and I absolutely love the way his PTSD is being shown (it would have been beyond unrealistic if jkr had just ignored the toll the past events played on a CHILD but a lot of authors would probably have done just that so kudos to her) and i (a mentally ill teenager) can really #relate to him being upset about /everyone/ being informed about the order before himAnother thing I really like about ootp is the beginning/rescue scene it's my favourite start of any of the books in the series (apart from maybe deathly hallows but that scene was a parallel to this one so..). Cho Chang is really well written in this book and, again, her reaction to Cedric's death was also 100% justified. (/SPOILERS/ also on a side note: contrary to what the movie showed it wasnt cho that ratted the DA out it was Marietta lol) Now that I've gotten all this off my chest o would like to just name a few of my favourite aspects of the book: - Tonks (one of my favourite characters) was introduced and I love her a lot and I loved the whole aspect of harry being able to feel hopeful again. Gracias jkr- everyone knows I hate the movies with a burning passion so it comes to know surprise that I absolutely love the way the characterizations of the characters are different (better) in the books (mostly the fact that Ron isn't just a stupid lazy no good jealous friend who only ever eats and hermione is perfect and has zero flaws and that ginny,,,, actually has a personality in the books) - I liked the McGonagall scenes. A lot. - unrelated but do you think lucius malfoy waited a long time in the ministry? Did he practice what he was gonna say? I'm not saying he used the crystal balls as mirrors to check his hair but he totally did - draco is a garbage kid but I love him also he is very much in love with Harry don't fight me on this - this is the only book in the series that I cry at everytime I reread it none of the other deaths moved me like this one did rip like nit even the death scene but the reaction to it yikes I'm gonna cry even more aren't I - I didn't like luna in the movies but I liked her in the books also she is probably the most #me like character of all time (only in the books) - Harry James Potter deserves the world - Dumbleton being emotionally abusive to Harry and manipulating him hmmmm that's homophobic Joanne - the Umbridge r**e scene was wild and unnecessary tho like. please don't. No matter how bad a female character is don't do that to them. Never do that to them. Especially as a self proclaimed feminist.

When I first read the series, it was my least favorite (because UMBRIDGE) but rereading the series has changed that and now, other than the Umbridge bit, this is one of my favorites in the series...despite the devastating ending. But more on that later.The Order of the Phoenix finds Harry still reeling from the terrible events at the end of The Goblet of Fire. Naturally, it's had lasting and devastating effects on him. I've never understood why some readers have complained about Harry's moodiness in this instalment because to me, it's obviously 110% warranted (big surprise, huh?) Honestly though, I dare anyone to go through half the shit that Harry does and remain happy and positive. Not.gonna.happen. And to top everything off, Harry and the rest of the school have that vile toad Umbridge to deal with. *fumes* The addition of Umbridge serves a purpose of course, and not just to torture the readers and students of Hogwarts. Her role is to further drive home the extent of corruption within the Ministry of Magic, not to mention proving how some people should never be given any amount of power.If you can move past Umbridge's infuriating presence, there's a lot of brilliant things going on in The Order of the Phoenix. There's more Sirius and Lupin, there's backstory on the first Wizarding War, the truly awesome formation of Dumbledore's Army, the introduction of the Room of Requirement, the OWLs, Quidditch (!!) and the looming, foreboding presence of Voldemort. I thought that the fact that Harry can now pick up on Voldy's moods to be truly compelling and terrifying. It's a key plot point that will be oh-so important later in the series. Oh and we finally get to know the real Ginny and she is just all kinds of awesome. I have so much love for her strength and how real she is here, she's a breath of fresh air U+2665 Her setting Harry straight in Grimmauld Place is one of my favorite things and it's from that point their kinship is kindled. And let's not forget Harry taking up the role of a DADA teacher and being spectacular at it! I absolutely loved Dumbledore's Army and how all the students learned so much from Harry's awesomeness. In The Chamber of Secrets, I'm always deeply bothered by Harry being an outcast. The same can be said for The Goblet of Fire but for me that was mostly due to Harry and Ron being on the outs. In The Order of the Phoenix, I enjoy how Harry just has zero fucks to give about it all. It bothers him, but he isn't scared of standing up for himself or telling people off for being prats. His new handle on things is incredibly admirable and...cut to me fangirling about The Boy Who Lives (AGAIN).Plot-wise, this is a huge book for a reason, there is a lot going on, many of which I alluded to above but I think the pacing remains tight, and other than the Grawp storyline - which I could have done without - I wouldn't remove a thing. The characters once again grow and mature significantly, the tone is intense, there's a HUGE LOSS at the end that is devastating beyond words (so I won't even try - I'll NEVER be ok with it) and a GINORMOUS reveal that puts us firmly on path for the end game that draws ever nearer. The Order of the Phoenix is an ultra compelling addition to the series and well worth the page count!"},

She wanted to read about Hogwarts; about spells, magical creatures and adventures. And she wasn't the only one. The main problem is the pace. This book paves the way for book 6 and 7. And while I appreciate Rowling taking her time to build up her finale, it doesn't work for me at all. This book is filled with more questions than answers U+2013 and most famously, I hate the way the thestrals were handled.(view spoiler)[Thestrals can only be seen by someone, who has watched someone die. One could argue that Harry should be able to see them from the get-go, but Rowling has made it clear, that he didn't fully comprehend what was happening to his parents as he was only a toddler, and therefore wasn't able to see thestrals. However, all that changes when he watched Cedric die in book four.But(!) shouldn't he then be able to see the thestrals, when he leaves the school in book four? Apparently not. Rowling says: \"If Harry had seen them then and we hadn't explained them then, I thought that would be rather a cheat on the reader in that Harry suddenly sees these monsters but we don't go anywhere with them, so to explain to myself I said that you had to have seen the death and allowed it to sink in a little bit before slowly these creatures became solid in front of you.\"The thestrals are a product of convinience. Rowling made up the clumsy rules (which are never fully explained in the books, leaving many readers puzzled), because she didn't want to explain the thestrals in the ending of a book. The solution she came up with is far from elegant, it is so contrived, making you extremely aware of the writer behind the book, pulling the strings and arranging the words in order to make the story flow nicely. (hide spoiler)]While I understand why Harry is angry, and while I understand why he needs to be isolated, I feel like Sirius was done a major injustice in this book. His restlessness is of course understandable, but his need to encourage Harry to trouble and danger is so unlike him. Sirius spent the entirety of book four warning Harry about upcoming dangers, urging him to be selfish and only focusing on getting safely out of the tournament. But in this book, Sirius suddenly becomes irresponsible, urging Harry to act out instead of being safe. Why? The man spent half of his lifetime in Azkaban U+2013 I would think he had learned some patience. Instead, a few months in hiding turns him into a madman.This book suffers from its length and from Harry's isolation. It becomes quite tiresome U+2013 though I of course always loved the idea of Dumbledore's Army as a way for the younger generation to mimic the Order of the Phoenix.[Thestrals can only be seen by someone, who has watched someone die.

But not really because Dumbledore persuaded the Ministry to make a hearing for Potter's case. And in all that, all summer the newspapers calls him a liar. A lot to deal with a fifteen years old boy!But then he meets the Order of the Phoenix (so many great characters!) and Ron and Hermione again in Twelve Grimmauld Place, Siriu's house. The trial scene was so stressful to read because Harry was sure he couldn't go again to Hogwarts and because of Dumbledore's behaviour (no eye contact with sad Harry but then at the end of the book we know why he acted like that!).Harry is now in Hogwarts with all his friends (we meet a new one, Luna Lovegood) and enemies (yep I'm talking about Malfoy) and again everything is falling apart. Harry is angry with everyone, Hagrid is missing, the fifth year is going to be hella stressfull and we meet a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Dolores Umbridge. The most amazing part in the book? The last battle!Yep the book has a battle and it is the most epic thing a reader could read!But let me talk about the veil. Is it true? No it can't be! I am still in denial.Why J.K. ? WHYYYY? (view spoiler)[Why kill Sirius? (hide spoiler)] The ending left me out of breath and my heart pounding like crazy!Can't wait for the next book and I know already that my heart is going to break in pieces.

After Harry's rejection from the secret order that Dumbledore established to fight the Dark Lord, due to his age, our young wizard decides to take matters into his hands.

This would be easier said than done, however, as the ministry begins to meddle in Hogwarts' affairs through the arrival of the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Dolores Umbridge. Every new installment of the series gets thicker and thicker, and for good reason because there aren't seem to be enough pages to contain all the excitement that this book provides.(view spoiler)[ My favorite scene (which its movie adaptation unfortunately didn't do justice to) was the unbelievable showdown between Dumbledore & Lord Voldemort in the halls of the Ministry.

He was described to have just gracefully walked through Lord Voldemort's attacks and performed highly advanced spells with minimal gestures of his wand.

And, undoubtably, Umbridge (someone who you'll want to strangle after a few hundred pages) was brilliantly portrayed as the villain. I enjoyed hating her so much, which means she was masterfully created.Though I've seen the films, and know what to expect in the coming titles, it's clear that so much content from the book is left out, which means I'll no doubt still be surprised when I come to read The Half-Blood Prince, which can only be a good thing; and seeing how shit kicked off towards the latter parts of The Order of the Phoenix, I'm expecting big thins from the next one."},

Such a good book. But strangely enough, I wouldn't consider it my favorite. My complaint about this book is how much it dragged in the beginning. I get the importance of introducing the house of Black and Order of the Phoenix, but still too long. Get to school already. What Rowling is excellent at is painting a picture of detail while still keeping you interested so you never know which minor incidents are going to comeback with major importance. It makes the books unpredictable. This is one of the few times in the series where I wished she'd cut out the detail. Little did I know how important those details were. At first read, I was disappointed with her writing. I felt she was tainted by the release of the movies, writing movie scripts instead of imaginative tales that could never come to pass on screen. But reading the series over again, I could not pinpoint my initial reaction so maybe it was me who was tainted. And then I heard that she waited so long to release this book because the series had hit worldwide fandom never before seen in children's literature and she was scared. I can respect that. I'll take all those years of tortured waiting for perfection."},

Also, Hermione got on my nerves a little as well with how much she was constantly nagging everyone.... Also, this book felt so LONG. And I know it was an 800 page book but there were a few parts that just dragged and I felt could have been removed? I don't know. To create a character, such as Umbridge, that someone can absolutely loathe whilst reading is a true talent and I must give Rowling props for that. (I hated her in this more than I've hated Voldemort in the whole series!) Overall I did enjoy this book very much however with those little things that annoyed me, I couldn't give it a higher rating.

Full post can be found HERE.Once upon a time, JK Rowling sat down to write the longest, most saddest and depressing book in the universe. She had it all planned out. First, she would isolate her hero to the breaking point. Then she would introduce the worldU+2019s most evil villain. She would have her hero overcome only to be stepped on and pushed down into the ground even further. The end of the book, well, that was going to be heartbreaking and intense and difficult, and not unlike a rollercoaster careening out of control and threatening to kill everyone aboard. But first before she did all that, she wanted to write about some kids taking some tests. It turned out pretty good, I think.CHAPTER 30: GRAWPOh, Hagrid. Hagrid, Hagrid, Hagrid, Hagrid. WHY.I mean, I know why. Maybe itU+2019s just because IU+2019m watching Battlestar Galactica right now, and itU+2019s the episode where they introduce the concept of U+2018projection,U+2019 but I canU+2019t help but feel that Hagrid lives his life in a constant state of his own type of projection.For those of you not familiar with BSG (and shame on you!), projection is an ability the Cylons have to influence directly their perception of the world around them. They want to see a lush forest surrounding them instead of the drab gray walls of their spaceship? Boom. The forest is there. They literally see it as if it were real. This of course is in itself a metaphor for the way that all people allow their beliefs and assumptions and wishes and desires to influence the way they interpret the world around them. I say that Hagrid projects not because I think he willfully deludes himself or because he is refusing to believe something deep down he already knows, but rather because his deeply ingrained belief in the goodness and beauty of dangerous creatures U+2014 and perhaps moreso his personal identification with their U+201CmisunderstoodU+201D and U+201CmonstrousU+201D natures U+2014 leads him to see things differently than other people. He wants to believe Skrewts are harmless, that raising a baby dragon in a wooden hut is possible, that he can teach a giant to speak English and live among humans. He wants to believe it so badly that his mind interprets the evidence to fit into his worldview. And yes, this optimism is the sign of a kind heart, but itU+2019s also the thing allows him to ignore real signs of danger.And donU+2019t think IU+2019m passing judgment on Hagrid, because IU+2019m not. First of all, because like I said above, we all project the world somewhat based on our wants and expectations, and depending on the person and the situation, thatU+2019s either good, bad, or somewhere in between. ItU+2019s called U+2018perspective.U+2019 But also: because we need kind fools like Hagrid (and Firenze and Dumbledore) to project versions of the world that are better than reality, because maybe one day reality will live up to their expectations.All of that is to say that this is the chapter we meet Grawp, HagridU+2019s U+201ClittleU+201D brother. (But first, some other stuff happens, too.)Speaking of people changing their circumstances, most Hogwarts students (and teachers!) are trying their damndest to keep Fred and GeorgeU+2019s legacy alive (in the case of the swamp in the corridor, quite literally). Not only does Umbridge have to clean up Fred and GeorgeU+2019s lingering messes, but the other students are now following their lead, playing pranks, interrupting classes, taking a shit-ton of Skiving Snackboxes when in UmbridgeU+2019s class, and just generally causing mayhem. And in one of my favorite moments of the books, Peeves takes Fred and GeorgeU+2019s request to U+201CGive her hell from usU+201D very seriously:U+201CBut not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken FredU+2019s parting words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he shut Mrs Norris inside a suit of armour, from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.U+201DAnd this isnU+2019t just hilarious. ItU+2019s having a very real affect on the shape of UmbridgeU+2019s days, which are now mostly spent putting out fires all over Hogwarts (literally and figuratively). ItU+2019s pissing her off, which probably means sheU+2019s going to blow soon, but in the short-term, I bet it just feels fantastic. As the DA discovered, actually doing something to change things makes a world of difference.Harry, meanwhile, is still dreaming of the mysterious corridor. The one that, according to everyone Harry has ever met, he should not be dreaming about ever. But even Sirius and LupinU+2019s warning that Occlumency is the most important thing Harry should be worrying about doesnU+2019t deter him. He has now admitted to himself that he wants the dreams to continue because heU+2019s curious. And this is where DumbledoreU+2019s plan backfired, because IU+2019m convinced if Harry knew the full and complete reason why Dumbledore was hiding things from him, Harry would have respected his wishes. Instead, armed with only the vague information heU+2019s picked up second-hand from the Order, Harry doesnU+2019t see the harm in indulging in the heretofore harmless visions. In fact, dreaming of the corridor once saved Mr. WeasleyU+2019s life, and as far as HarryU+2019s concerned, thatU+2019s justification enough. The same situation + two different sets of experiences and information = two completely different perspectives. Dumbledore projects his own course of reasonable actions onto Harry, and assumes Harry will follow suit.Another interesting case of projection is Ron and his Quidditch. The older he gets, for me, the more interesting he becomes. As a kid in the very first book, he made it clear that he felt overshadowed by his older brothers, but as heU+2019s grown older weU+2019ve seen physical evidence of it. Ron is a capable Quidditch player (in fact, heU+2019s probably capable at a lot of things heU+2019s never even bothered trying at because of the mistaken idea heU+2019d never be good enough). He might even be great. RonU+2019s problem is that he doesnU+2019t believe that he is a capable Quidditch player, and he allows his own fears and the outward signs others give (Malfoy and the SlytherinsU+2019 cruel baiting, Fred and GeorgeU+2019s teasing, for instance) to affect him to such an extent that he actually believes himself to be what they say he is. This is interesting, especially in the case of Fred and George, who are teasing by nature, and who actually probably think RonU+2019s pretty cool, even if they would never say it to his face. The problem with this is that Ron is incapable of distinguishing their intent from their actions, and with someone with self-esteem issues as Ron has, thatU+2019s a dangerous combination. ThatU+2019s why RonU+2019s Quidditch win and the turning around of U+201CWeasley is Our KingU+201D is so great. ItU+2019s not just about Quidditch. ItU+2019s about Ron finally getting out of his own way.Of course, Harry and Hermione miss RonU+2019s breakthrough entirely because Hagrid chooses the Quidditch match as the perfect distraction for taking two students into the Forbidden Forest to introduce them to a giant. A giant, might I add, who he basically kidnapped and is now holding captive.ItU+2019s a mark of just how important Grawp is to Hagrid that he pays little to no attention to how difficult a time Harry and Hermione have trekking through the Forbidden Forest. By the time they reach GrawpU+2019s clearing, their robes are torn, and they have scratches everywhere. And then we learn:*Hagrid is afraid heU+2019s going to get the sack any day now, and heU+2019s probaby right. Umbridge has it out for him.Hagrid is keeping a sixteen foot giant in a clearing in the Forbidden Forest.*Grawp is his half-brother. Because Grawp is U+201Csmall for a giantU+201D he got bullied by the other giants, so out of U+201CprotectionU+201D for Grawp, Hagrid forced him to come back to Hogwarts.*He wants to make sure someone visits Grawp, continues trying to teach him English. He thinks if he can teach Grawp manners he can show people he is U+201Charmless,U+201D and that maybe then he can live among humans. (!) He says this with blood dripping down his nose from just having been injured by Grawp.*Hagrid wants Harry and Hermione (and Ron if heU+2019ll help, too) to continue visiting Grawp so that he knows they want him to stay.Grawp responds by ripping up a tree.*To repeat my earlier phrasing, itU+2019s a mark of just how much Harry and Hermione love Hagrid that they agree. Although, to be fair, I donU+2019t actually think either one of them ever intended to come visit Grawp again, especially after what happens with the Centaurs.Ah, yes. The Centaurs.In response to the second war with Voldemort and the treatment they have received in the past from wizards, the Centaurs have closed ranks. When Firenze, the most levelheaded of the bunch, deigns to help out humans, and worse, peddle Centaur secrets, they tried to murder him. We of course side with Firenze and Hagrid, but I think itU+2019s interesting to consider why the Centaurs are acting in this way. From their insulated perspective, with their history, their actions make sense. They interpret everything as a threat, a betrayal, an insult, because that is what they expect to see. Firenze is the only one who is able to widen his perspective and interpret their circumstances with a different set of guidelines, ones that have everyoneU+2019s best interests in mind. (See above conclusion of about kindhearted fools.)"},

Nun muss Harry seine Freunde um sich scharen, sonst gibt es kein Entrinnen. \"Es ist dir so wenig egal, dass du das GefU+00FChl hast, du wU+00FCrdest vor Schmerz darU+00FCber verbluten.\" - Albus Dumbledore, S. 967Meine MeinungU+201EHarry Potter und der Orden des PhU+00F6nixU+201C ist der lU+00E4ngste Teil dieser Buchreihe. Auch wenn die Geschichte manchmal unnU+00F6tig gestreckt wirkt, so kommt definitiv keine Langweile auf. J.K. Rowling lU+00E4sst sich am Anfang des Buches sehr viel Zeit und scheint auch einige Probleme zu haben in ihre eigene Welt hereinzukommen.Harry ist ja nun fU+00FCnfzehn und um einiges launischer und empfindlicher. Auch wenn man irgendwo im Hinterkopf hat, dass er eine Menge durchgemacht hat und mitten in der PubertU+00E4t ist, kann man stellenweise wirklich nur den Kopf U+00FCber diese kleine Dramaqueen schU+00FCtteln. Alles was er in der ersten HU+00E4lfte des Buches macht ist seine Freunde anschreien und wie ein Weltmeister jammern. Dazu kommt noch, dass er richtig beratungsresistent ist, bis er mal checkt, dass seine Freunde auf seiner Seite stehen.Hermine und Ron machen dann das Trio, wie gewohnt, komplett. Mir gefU+00E4llt einfach die Art von Freundschaft die hier dargestellt wird; die drei sind in einem Moment damit beschU+00E4ftigt Hausaufgaben zu machen und sich gegenseitig wegen Kleinigkeiten anzuzicken, um im nU+00E4chsten Moment ein eingespieltes Team zu sein und es mit jedem aufzunehmen. Und wenn Harry und Ron mal auf Hermine hU+00F6ren wU+00FCrden, dann wU+00E4re U+00FCber die HU+00E4lfte nicht passiert. Die Freundschaft der drei trU+00E4gt den GroU+00DFteil der kompletten Buchreihe und wird in keinem Moment in den Hintergrund gerU+00FCckt. Ganz im Gegenteil, es wird sich immer die Zeit genommen und verdeutlicht wie nah sich die Personen stehen.Auch in diesem Band konzentriert sich J. K. Rowling auf den Schulalltag und da die Protagonisten nun im PrU+00FCfungsjahr sind kommt sogar so etwas wie Abwechslung auf. Es ist schon ziemlich amU+00FCsant, wie sich die HU+00E4lfte der Charaktere verrU+00FCckt macht und fragt ob die Anderen auch acht bis zehn Stunden am Tag lernen, wU+00E4hrend andere die Arschruhe schlechthin haben und gechillt ein bisschen Stoff wiederholen. Dass andere Charaktere wie Neville, Ginny und Luna nun etwas mehr in das Geschehen miteinbezogen werden sorgt dann nochmal fU+00FCr frischen Wind. Und es fU+00FChrt zu dem Problem, dass man sich am Ende gar nicht entscheiden kann, wer denn nun der Lieblingscharakter ist.Es gibt immer wieder humorvolle HU+00F6hepunkte, wie der stilvollste Schulabbruch aller Zeiten, hingelegt von Fred und George Weasley oder die Unterrichtsinspektionen von Umbridge, einem Charakter den man U+00FCbrigens nur hassen kann. Da gibt es diese ganze Reihe an Antagonisten, die gefU+00E4hrlich und wahnsinnig sind, abgrundtief bU+00F6se und dennoch so viel Stil haben. Sie unterhalten und sind nicht zimperlich, sie sind grausam und trotzdem liebt man es sie zu hassen U+2026 und dann gibt es diese Truller, die man einfach nur leidenschaftlich hasst. Jedenfalls, sind die Szenen anfangs einfach nur zum WegschmeiU+00DFen, wenn Umbridge auf ihrem Klemmbrett rumkritzelt und die kompetenten Lehrer, allen voran McGonagall ihr mit Unmengen an Klasse und Sarkasmus Kontra geben.Trotz des erstklassigen Humors hat J.K. Rowling sich die Ereignisse und dessen Auswirkungen des vorherigen Bandes konzentriert. Die AtmosphU+00E4re ist nun dU+00FCsterer und drU+00FCckender. Es hat sich viel verU+00E4ndert und die Autorin hat diese VerU+00E4nderung wunderbar aufgegriffen und arbeitet stetig mit ihnen. Die ganze Geschichte hat nun eine andere Richtung eingeschlagen.Dann wU+00E4re da noch die Sache mit dem Orden des PhU+00F6nix, der schon interessant ist. Allerdings hU+00E4tte einiges mehr an Informationen und einigen zusU+00E4tzlichen Szenen nicht geschadet, damit man nicht U+00FCber die HU+00E4lfte des Buches den roten Faden sucht U+2013 und das, obwohl man das Buch schonmal gelesen hat.Das Ende ist dann so wie ich es in Erinnerung hatte. Spannend und schnell, fesselnd und abwechslungsreich. Man fiebert mit, ist stolz auf einige Charaktere und jubelt wenn die VerstU+00E4rkung kommt. Und dann kommt dieser brutale Umschwung. Im einen Moment fiebert man noch mit um kurz darauf geschockt zu sein, als ein Charakter stirbt und man weiU+00DF sofort: Oh Shit, jetzt ist die Kacke richtig am dampfen. U+00DCbrigens muss ich mal ganz ehrlich sagen, dass nichts davon passiert wU+00E4re wenn Harry mal auf Hermine gehU+00F6rt hU+00E4tte. Der ganze Showdown ist das Ergebnis seiner ImpulsivitU+00E4t und Beratungsresistenz.sDas abschlieU+00DFende GesprU+00E4ch von Harry und Dumbledore ist dann sehr emotional. Auch wenn Informationen preisgegeben werden, scheinen sie ein bisschen in den Hintergrund zu rU+00FCcken, da man einfach nur mit Harry mitleidet. J.K. Rowling beschreibt die Wut und den Schmerz des Verlustes unglaublich realistisch und mit so viel GefU+00FChl, dass man gar nicht anders kann, als eine TrU+00E4ne zu verdrU+00FCcken, wenn Harry schreit, dass er kein Mensch sein mU+00F6chte, wenn dieser Schmerz dazu gehU+00F6rt.Fazit Ja, ich bin dazu im Stande in U+201EHarry Potter und der Orden des PhU+00F6nixU+201C kleinere Kritikpunkte zu finden. Das U+00E4ndert nichts daran, dass es ein tolles Buch ist und J.K. Rowling eine talentierte Autorin. Wenn Harry Potter nicht gleichzeitig unglaublich viel meiner Kindheit und Jugend verkU+00F6rpern wU+00FCrde, kU+00F6nnte ich mich vielleicht sogar zu einer anderen Bewertung (aber trotzdem eine sehr gute) durchringen. Aber es geht um \"Harry Potter und der Orden des PhU+00F6nixU+201C, dem Buch an dem an einigen Seiten mein Blut klebt, weil ich mir mit zwU+00F6lf meinen letzten Milchzahn ausriss und nicht, fU+00FCr so eine Kleinigkeit, aufhU+00F6ren wollte zu lesen. 5/5 Sternen"},

Harry Potter is just intensely gripping, full of magic and a great fantastical creationU+2026AMAZING!!! JK RowlingU+2019s Harry Potter series is just outstanding and which has totally blown me away hence I am finding it hard to express my feelings with just mere words. JK Rowling is the most spectacular author whose accomplished writing style, combined with inspired creativity and flair is just exceptional and whose work has really touched my heart; as a devoted reader to the fantasy genre and a HUGE fan of Harry Potter already!!! The cunning and clever plot that twists and turns to keep you guessing throughout until the very end is truly original, and which sends chills down your spine as you become lost within a tale that is so complex and surprisingly so wonderful. This series of beautiful books have the most beautiful, exquisite and striking covers that I have ever seen within childrenU+2019s fiction and which really does in essence bring fantasy to life! Even the back cover image is so mysterious and mystical that it made me gasp the first time that I clapped eyes on it as I love the vibrancy which is so striking. In HarryU+2019s fifth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry everything changes, as a new edition to the teaching staff in the form of powder-puff pink Delores Umbridge is an unwelcome and most alarming edition. The Order of the Phoenix is a group of incredible Witches and Wizards who really do U+2018save the dayU+2019 and who are to Harry and his group of friends people to admire and aspire to, such as his Godfather Sirius. HarryU+2019s relationship with Sirius is one that touches your innermost core and what happened to him I can only express as it made me feel like my heart was being forcibly ripped from my chest U+2013 it was excruciating pain and as a reader to feel such emotion, such heartache and hatred against other characters and pity even is such a powerful thing. Full of suspense and hidden secrets that was nail-biting and so intense, this dramatic tale is just so exciting and unexpected as you constantly want to read on and find out more!! This is an electrifying adventure that is so impossible to put down and which caters to both young and old readers alike, for we can all connect and relate to each individual character (or creature!). I loved the members of the order who are all so distinctive each with their own individual traits and quirky habits, such as the Werewolf Lupin and Nyphadora Tonks (who is AMAZING!), the Weasley family and Kreacher. The noble house of black @ Number twelve Grimmauld Place is such an inspired creation and one that is seeped in mystery and hidden secrets. With HarryU+2019s complicated teenage love life (Cho chang and then Ginny), and the deadly danger of Voldemort and his Death Eaters now lurking in the shadows since he arose once again, this gripping tale will have you turning the pages faster than the flapping wings of a Golden Snitch!! This tale just left me wanting to read more and the only negative I have about JK RowlingU+2019s remarkable Harry Potter series, is that the stories always seem to end on a slight cliffhanger thus I routinely burst into tears and have a fit U+2013 for I am so impatient to read the next book!! I am constantly astonished and blown away by the Harry Potter creation which shall forever be etched within my memory for all-time. A few images to express how I feelU+2026       "},

Rowling's treatment of her female characters and what kind of message/impression her books actually give out to readers, concerning the issues of women being in charge:Since I can't remember much about those characters' names, so do forgive me to refer those HP characters as 'what's-her-name'.Important Note II: I only read the first four books of the series, and see no reason to continue reading. So people, kindly put your \"You should read the whole series!\" suggestion on hold.Here's my finding:(1)There're a few of female professors in the magical boarding school (I don't bother to check the name up), and I especially remember one of them being just a stereotyped 'crazy auntie' type who acts feeble-minded and is pretty much useless.Here you go for Rowling's version of woman with a teaching position.(2)Plus after Dumbledore is removed from his position, we have that female what's-her-name school president who is evil and feeble-minded and cruel to HP to take over Dumbledore's position. Oh hell, so when a woman gets to be in charge, her performance has to be worse than a guy's. Here you go for Rowling's version of woman being in charge. How insulting.(3)Not to mention in book 4 of the series, there's this Rita-what's-her-family-name paparazzi character, whose purpose of existence is to tell horrible lies about Harry Potter and Co, then sells those lies to the public; a character whom we're supposed to dislike. Here you go for Rowling's version of woman with a job.(4)Not to mention the example of good adult woman in the story is Molly, a full time housewife.(5) Hermoine, one of the few saving grace of this series, is often being presented as an annoying know-it-all, and her effort of freeing the House Elves is being treated (by both her friends and her creator, Rowling herself) as a joke. To add insult to injure, Hermoine's flaws seems to always be highlighted and made fun of, whilst Harry and Ron's flaws are always seem to be forgiven and/or put-up-with.Here you go for Rowling's version of a smart, caring girl.Fuck. This. Shit.Don't get me wrong, I'm 100% okay with women being housewives, but when (1) to (5) all adding together, I find it rather hilarious to claim Rowling is oh-so pro-feminism.Perhaps I'm being biased, but I honestly can't recall an example of woman being in charge in HP whilst being presented in a good light.Conclusion: I'm not saying J K. Rowling is an anti feminist and there is no strong, likable female character in the series, but I'm not happy with how those strong, likable female characters are being assigned by their creator to be mere helpers of the menfolk, then they didn't do much outside of tagging along and being supportive when the guys went out to have adventures.

The plot is intense. Harry is back at Hogwarts for another year. Things get heavy really quickly: everyone believes Harry is a liar, HogwartsU+2019 staff is flipped upside down and heU+2019s getting nightmares about a strange door and about Voldermort. I knew this book was going to be heavier and darker than the previous ones but I didnU+2019t realize actually how much. This one took me a lot longer to read than I wanted to but I wasnU+2019t bored at any point whatsoever. I loved getting to know so much more about the world and all the revelations and discoveries about the history that we get. I always feel like thereU+2019s more to learn than weU+2019re given and IU+2019m glad we got a bigger glimpse of the outside wizarding world in this book. ItU+2019s so much vaster than at first glance. Despite how much I loved this book, IU+2019m actually petrified to continue to read the rest of the series. I just know things are going to go downhill fast and that it will hit me very hard and I donU+2019t know if IU+2019m prepared. Harry really frustrated me in this book and itU+2019s because of something in his characterization that just plain bothers me every time he does it. I understand the position heU+2019s in during this book, but heU+2019s just moody and angry and he takes it out of the people that donU+2019t need it. He resents that people care about him and are trying to protect him even when theyU+2019re in the right because heU+2019s just plain reckless! He wasnU+2019t thinking, wasnU+2019t being smart and ended up making things a whole lot worse than was actually necessary. It has bigger consequences than he realizes and yet when he figures it out, itU+2019s already too late. I donU+2019t know how I feel about Ron. Sometimes I like him and I feel for him, heU+2019s funny but overshadowed and he has a confidence problem which I can totally relate to. But other times, he just gets on my last nerve! He can be just as reckless and stupid as Harry and together sometimes they donU+2019t make the greatest combination. On the other hand, IU+2019m a huge fan of Hermoine and sheU+2019s becoming one of my favorite characters of all time. SheU+2019s fierce and takes no shit from the two male characters in their trio. SheU+2019s smarter than they are and braver a lot of the times. A part of me almost wants to re imagine this series with her as the protagonist because I wouldU+2019ve loved to have seen inside her head. Sometimes she gets on my nerves when she mothers to the point of smothering but I also tend to do that with my friends so I canU+2019t really fault her for that. I wanted to mention quickly that I absolutely love Hagrid and I hate Umbridge with a giant passion."},

Teenage AngstThis was the least enjoyable part of the novel honestly. Like yeah teenagers have their horrible phase but my god Harry get over yourself. He can be such an idiot. There were moments he got on my nerves, mostly to do with the incredibly awkward romance element, but never for long because Hermione and Ginny were always there to sort him out.  Umbridge is horrendousU+2026 and intriguingUmbridge added an interesting element to the novel as an antagonist. She wasnU+2019t the big bad evil and was working toward what she thought was a just cause, but the things she did to achieve her cause were absolutely horrendous. I would not want her as a teacher ever.  Intense action scenesUp until now the action scenes of the series have been kept to a minimum really. Or at least they werenU+2019t overly impressive. But the showdown in THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX!! That was intense and so suspenseful and absolutely fabulous. I hope the rest of the action scenes in the final part of the series are just as good if not better.  NO PEOPLE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DIE YETI know a lot of people die in these books, there is a war beginning after all, but I WASNU+2019T SURPRISED FOR A BIG CHARACTER DEATH SO SOON. MY FEELS WERENU+2019T PREPARED FOR ONE OF MY FAVOURITE CHARACTERS TO DIE. And if I reacted like this now, my body is not ready for the next two books.  IN SUMMARYHARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX is a great addition to the series. Darker, more violent, and with so many more intricate plot lines and feels. Though I was a bit annoyed with some of the teen angst elements at times they didnU+2019t ruin my enjoyment. I am so excited and terrified to watch this war fold out in the next few books. "},

Y tardo bastante en leer libros gordos, pero es que este libro no querU+00EDa correr para nada. Porque es Harry P y no soy la mU+00E1s fan del mundo pero me gusta mucho mucho. Y pude fangirlear todos los dU+00EDas de mi vida con esta quinta entrega. NO podrU+00EDa darle menos de cinco gordos y pochochos cokys.Todos sabemos que Harry Potter se va poniendo mU+00E1s feo segU+00FAn van avanzando las novelas U+00BFcierto? Luego de un cuarto libro sobradamente dramU+00E1tico en sus compases finales llega este libro. Donde Harry tiene quince aU+00F1os y sus hormonas estU+00E1n en sindicato: o sea en pleno estado de revoluciU+00F3n. Y no ayuda que lo ataquen un par de dementores y que estU+00E9 en riesgo de ser expulsado del colegio. Y mU+00E1s encima sus tU+00EDos que tanto lo odian. Con tantos problemas en sus espaldas es un milagro que no se vuelva loco. Pocos saben que el SeU+00F1or Tenebroso regresU+00F3 en verdad y el resto no quieren creerlo. El Profeta e incluso muchos alumnos de Hogwarts no le creen a Harry y lo tildan de loco.  Solo tiene a sus amigos, a los siempre leales Weasley y a su querido padrino Sirius Black alias Hocicos. Y a Dumbledore, aunque este parece no querer voltearlo a mirar. U+00BFPoca cosa no? SU+00FAmenle que ahora Harry tiene sueU+00F1os mezclados con visiones de pasillos y puertas, ademU+00E1s le duele mucho la cicatriz...Voy a intentar contener mi fangirleo. Este libro es el mU+00E1s largo pero me ha encantado igualmente.  Siento que ha habido mU+00E1s tiempo para desarrollar toda la trama: desde las vacaciones hasta todo el aU+00F1o escolar, teniendo en cuenta que los anteriores siempre eran mas cortos. Harry es un adolescente en todo su esplendor y se hace patente en el libro. La mayorU+00EDa del libro estU+00E1 enojado, cometiendo errores que paga caro y enojU+00E1ndose con sus amigos. Se entiende seU+00F1ores, todo por lo que ha pasado a sus 15 aU+00F1os le estU+00E1 pasando factura.ReseU+00F1a completa: http://rapsodia-literaria.blogspot.co..."},

Because it's HARRY FREAKIN' POTTER.Anyway, I enjoyed this one. Not as good as the fourth one, in my humble opinion, but still great.First of all ... My oh my, this book is long. Almost 900 pages. However, I still managed to read it in only a few sittings (mostly due to long hours spent in the car, thanks to college visits). Did it need to be that long? Well, I'm not sure. The thing about J.K. Rowling is, she disperses all these little details throughout the books that seem unimportant at the time and then end up being significant later on. So I don't know, perhaps every last word in this book will end up being important later.At least its lengthiness helped in character development. I'd heard, prior to reading this, that Harry's angstiness level would go up about 100 notches, which is true. He does seem to keep SCREAMING AT PEOPLE IN ALL CAPITAL LETTERS! (I really hate when dialogue is written in all-caps because it looks silly, but ... Oh well.) And I liked how new characters were introduced. Luna is amusing, and Umbridge is creepy as hell. I don't really like Cho; she's kind of a boring crybaby. (view spoiler)[And yes, I know her boyfriend died and all, but she still annoys me. (hide spoiler)]What I did like, however, was how realistic Harry and Cho's relationship is. In a lot of YA fiction you have all those swoon-y type romances where it's all love-at-first-sight and the two lovebirds are practically singing back and forth to each other in poetic dialogue. But in this case, it felt like a genuine awkward first-romance, complete with all the awkward pauses and not knowing what to do, etc. It was so realistic, the awkwardness was almost painfulU+2013 U+2013but, you know, in a good way.I guess that's all I really have to say. Besides the obvious ... (view spoiler)[R.I.P.

Anyway, back to Harry Potter, I kind of dislike the order of phoenix concept. They didnU+2019t feel solid enough for me. I mean if you-know-who had been keeping low profile then what exactly did they do? They seemed awfully busy. Not that I take prime ministerU+2019s side, but that way they did seem suspicious to those who didnU+2019t believe you-know-whoU+2019s return. And the way they kept almost everything from the kids is just felt wrong. Harry, too, was not very helpful to make people want to believe him with all his attitude. As an outsider, I have to say, it is easier to believe the daily prophetU+2019s version as they serve more proofs. Compared to the previous books, this book is more emotional especially with some romance between Harry and Cho Chang. Not that itU+2019s bad, but I never liked that pair. As a Ravenclaw, thus a smart girl, who is a year older than Harry, Cho was quite childish. But the whole story is great despite the sad ending that seemed to gets worse in each book of this series.

After another long, miserable summer with the Dursleys and completely out of touch with what's happening in the wizarding world, Harry finally learns that while no help from the Ministry is forthcoming in standing against Voldemort, Dumbledore has called the old resistance movement from the first war back together: The Order of the Phoenix. But nobody will tell Harry and his friends exactly what they think Voldemort is planning and what the Order is up to, insisting they are far too young and to be kept out of the loop. More frustration comes upon the return to Hogwarts: A Ministry official has been put onto the Hogwarts staff and is slowly but surely asserting more and more control over the school in order to keep both students and teachers firmly under the Ministry's thumb. And then there are the strange dreams Harry has more and more often, stemming from his strange connection to Voldemort...At almost a thousand pages, this is the longest book in the series, but it certainly never gets boring. One of the things I really like about J.K. Rowling's books is that her teenagers actually behave like teenagers - and here, at 15, Harry and friends have well and truly hit puberty, with all its rashness, frustration, hormonal imbalance, temper tantrums and feeling oh so very misunderstood. It makes the characters, magical as they are, so much more realistic. Prior to beginning my re-read of the series, I had also forgotten how much we don't know until this book - \"Order of the Phoenix\" is a gamechanger in many ways, and things look bleaker than ever at its end, with story and characters alike having grown up a lot since the first book."},

It was so unusual for those two to disagree---but it was well written.There were a few minor inconsisties and odds and ends that I did not like--but overall my impression of this book it is is one of the better of the series.

And I enjoyed it way more this time.U+201CIndifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.U+201D Bueno, fue mU+00E1s triste de lo que me acordaba. Especialmente el final. Como la primera vez, no llorU+00E9, pero me costU+00F3 mU+00E1s esta vez. Me reU+00ED mucho tambiU+00E9n. Me acuerdo que Umbridge me molestaba tanto que hizo que me gustara menos el libro, aunque ahora no me pasU+00F3. Tal vez porque sabU+00EDa como termina el libro. Igual la sigo odiando.En definitiva, un libro genial como todos en la serie. Y esta vez lo disfrute mucho mU+00E1s."},

You would think that it's a children's book and it would be childish and all but dude it's absolutely amazing. It started beautifully and ended beautifully. I love her writing style like so much. I got so annoyed that it was taking me so much time to read this, but I had so much homework that I literally took 2-3 weeks, which is unacceptable. All I wanna say is that this series is life. And I'm not kidding when I say this, after reading each book I see the movie and just feels are flying all over the room. In this book we meet Luna Lovegood and can I just say that I love her so much. She is amazing and the fact that she can read upside-down is pretty cool. I already ship Luna with somebody and I know that the ship that I'm thinking of is true so just feels feels feels. This review does not do justice at all to this book, but I tried. PS- I don't want this series to end so quickly. Like after this is the second last book, like what?"}
