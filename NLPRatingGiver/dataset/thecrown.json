GEE.I JUST FINISHED THE CROWN AND I CANU+2019T KEEP CALM!!!IU+2019ve been reading mixed reviews about this last installment of The Selection by Kiera Cass, so I was so nervous to start it and to finish it. But guess what I feel after reading it? I AM SO HAPPY I was literally crying as I was finishing the book. I was not disappointed that much except by a few parts.What I really like about   The Crown is that the characters and their relationships have been well developed. I have loved each and every one of them until the very last page. Yes, even Josie whom I loathed so much before that I almost wished for another massacre in the palace just to get her out of the picture.There were also a lot of things revealed about Maxon and America, things we never knew about them before. The two of them are really admirable and I would miss them. They are one of the best fictional parents and couples ever written. I could say that they got better and better from what IU+2019ve seen in them from the very first book.We also got to know more about The Elite and I was really surprised about those facts. IU+2019m really glad for them all, especially Kile, Hale, and Ean. I want to hug the three of them.I am really happy that Eadlyn ended up withU+2026 one of the guys I was shipping. I really knew that they could be the one for each other since I was reading the previous book. I sure am going to have a happy book-hangover after this.What didnU+2019t work for me, first, is how the coronation part was written. The reasons for it were not enough for me. It was really sweet, yes, but it was kind of mishandled, and showed a bit of irresponsibility from the other characters. I could say that it was too abrupt. The second one is the Epilogue. It was so short, and the words written in it could have been placed in the authorU+2019s Acknowledgements!! Those were such lovely words but it wonU+2019t satisfy anyone. Lastly, I wasnU+2019t that happy with how the ending was written. I am really glad of how it ended, I swear, itU+2019s just that it wasnU+2019t that grand. I want a very unforgettable ending not a simple one! I think this series deserved a better closing than that.Overall, this series is going to be remembered. If you asked me as I was reading the first three books if I love this series, I would say that I don't love it that much. Now, I could say that I really do. It proved that love is imperfect but itU+2019s us who make it beautiful. Sometimes itU+2019s all about perspective, as one of the characters has said. You just have to learn to look at the right place, at the right angle, to find what youU+2019re looking for.Now, I should go back to my corner and cry my eyes out. I will really miss this series."},

In any case, everything goes wrong because Eadlyn manages to fall for the one and only guy in the castle who isn't trying to put a ring on it. Good going there. Besides the shallowness and narrow-mindedness and egotism, Eadlyn is an awful role model. When she's self-confident, she shows it by putting other people down (she especially likes to make fun of poor people). And the rest of the time she's ridiculously insecure. For example, one guy tells her he can't marry her because he doesn't swing that way, and her immediate response is:\"This was my worst fear coming to life. I was unlovable. I knew it.\"I CANNOT BELIEVE this girl. I really hope there aren't any impressionable young ladies taking lessons from Eadlyn's behavior. So glad this series is over and can't plague me anymore.

Nauseating romance and shitty predictable politics. 35 boys and 3 of my favourites in the top 10 and Eadlyn didn't choose any of those three instead went for the one I absolutely hated. The Heir is the only book I enjoyed in this series. This book takes up from where The Heir left off. And turns it into a total mess! Kiera's writing has always been ordinary so I wasn't expecting much in this field. Same goes with the humour and world building. Her characters have also been okay-ish but in The Heir she upped in this field. Some of the boys were very charming. Though I admit Eadlyn, like her parents, was irritating as hell. Very unfortunately in this book even the charming ones lose their awesomeness. Some of them act totally out of character. For instance, (view spoiler)[ Hale and Ean turn out to be gay? No way!

Everybody lost something or the other and I lost my hope for this one. It felt like somewhere along the way Kiera decided to change her mind about all of them, even the plot and turned everything upside down. Everything was too convenient, too predictable. The romance? unappealing. 2 stars because I wanted to see what would happen next. If you've read this one, please talk to me. I need to talk about my fav three dudes.All in all, The Selection series never fails to disappoint. [ Ean, Kile and okay even Hale would work. (hide spoiler)][ Hale and Ean turn out to be gay?

I mean, all these wars Kiera made up to build her dystopian world and their incomes are pretty ridiculous. In which parallel universe China would be eager for additional labor force? Why not territory or natural resources? Why enslaving USA and not Russia which is closer and so weak in The Selection's world? And why exactly is it so weak? For what reason so many countries became an absolute monarchies ones again? Not limited, absolute! World-building sucks, as you see. But the plot is no better. It's predictable as hell. Or as a surprise b-day party your friends are organizing right in front of your eyes. Kiera has no idea how to deal with plot-twists. You would foresee everything like a fucking psychic. But even foreseeing won't save your poor eyes from rolling.Let's start with the idea. 35 guys plus 1 girl who's our MC. You know what's wrong? When we had a reverse situation and MC was among competitresses, we were watching over her romance only, we weren't forced to sympathize with other young ladies, and thus we didn't feel bad when they, one by one, were sent away. In Eadlyn's case, we meet with a bunch of really nice suitors, they tell us their stories and show us their natures. Some of them are plot-tools, some are quite interesting persons. We start to like them. And then we have to see how they fall in love with a stupid brat who uses them and their admiration to look better in medias and doesn't give a damn about their feelings. Moreover, she herself is falling for a boy who's outside the Selection, but it doesn't stop her from playing with competitors. I can't like or respect such a woman. Not because of her harem, but because of her lies.So, the idea sucks as much as the world-building does. Who/what else sucks? Eadlyn. In the first book she was a bitch, in this one she became wise, kind, and patient. You know how much time had passed between The Heir and The Crown? ONE NIGHT. OOC much, anyone? The funny thing is, it didn't help. She's still unlikable. And silly. What a great qualities for a future queen. Why future, though. Acting! 'Cause Maxon and America had grew tired of ruling and decided to step away by given Eadlyn the crown. I thought Maxon was smarter, but The Heir and the final book proved me wrong. Such a shame.By the way, Eadlyn tells everyone that she's working hard, that her duties are difficult and serious, but all we see is a few conversations with screaming politicians. Their dialogues look like that:  \"Your brother ran away to the other country. This is treason.\"\"You're fired. He did it for love.\"Or:  \"People hate you. We need to marry you fast. 'Cause you know, husbands can solve social problems, hunger and stuff\"\"Okay. Everything for my lovely kingdom.\"And reports. How could I forget! Eadlyn reads them all the time, 'cause Kiera thinks this is how monarchs rule their countries. Read papers, do nothing. Be cool and look pretty. This is so hard, I feel sorry for dear Eady! *grim face*.Competitors and Erik. Quite everyone leaves the Selection by his own will, all the dates Eadlyn had with the boys were fast and had no emotive power. But even those dates were more than nothing which she had with Erik. I knew she would choose him, 'cause this was such an obvious twist, right in da Cass's style. But what the heck with love-you-declarations? These two had no time to really fall for each other and yet they are in looooove. It has no sense.You know what else has no sense? Henry and Engish. This guy spent a lot of time among natives, he had a translator as a buddy and took lessons quite every day. You might think he became fluent under favorable auspices. Nope. \"Good, good\" or \"Hello today!\" - that's all he could say. And he understood nothing! Henry could recognize his own name in a conversation, and nothing more. WHAT THE FUCK? Kiera overestimates complexity of her language. She even wrote that Henry would have to learn English for 5 years to communicate on a so-so level. As I said before in my status updates, we humble foreigners can do better.Queers. Eadlyn chose six boys and two of them turned out to be gays and in love with each other. My opinion? Don't involve gays in this theater of absurd!The final. When sweet Henry in super awful English gave his blessing to Erik and Eadlyn, I started to cry. Because of his English, of course, and because of his sweetness too. This moment had almost convinced me to give the Crown 2 out of 5 stars, and then Santa Barbara with Maxon, his father's mistress, her bastard-daughter and their fates did happen, and... it was so unnecessary and lame, I might hear Lady Brice gasped and begged Kiera to reconsider that twist.Overall. This is a story about a princess who had to go through the Selection, which was very important, but when she proposed (no kidding, she did) to a random guy, and everything ended fine. Like, who cares about the thing we all were so concerned about? This is a story about young men who were fooled and dismissed. This is also the story about a prince who ran away with a queen of another country and hadn't come back when his mother was dying, but arrived to his sister's party. They said he was a great man. I don't think so. And this is a story about Maxon and America who saw how their people suffer within absolute monarchy, but instead of giving them parliament or democracy, they gave the crown a simpleton with a big ego. In other words, this is a story that you'd rather read never ever.

Eadlyn is forced to confront not just her family's opinion of her, but that of the public in general and her previous coldness and self-absorption all but vanishes in this awakening of the new and improved Eadlyn. She becomes the protagonist I always wished her to be and a strong and fierce female, unafraid to voice her opinion and rule her country with its best interests at heart, is awoken. Eadlyn's increasing involvement in the running of Illea leave the romance aspect of this book to be pushed to the background and, in its place, a better understanding of her stressful position and her everyday responsibilities arose.There was a greater focus paid on the characters of the last book, who had previously blended into the background, and I got to understand their motives and mindsets alot better. This made for a more rounded and complex plot. The development in relationship with Eadlyn and some of these I did see coming but this, however, did not hamper my enjoyment of the book as each character continued to receive the ending I envisioned for them.I have had mixed feelings about this series but this final installment has made it all worth it. It is the series crowning glory (pun intended).

That tension was the most addictive part of the original trilogy - even though that story was always very obvious, it was the ups and downs along the way that had me tearing my hair out because I just wanted those character to get together. Kiera is a wonderful tease of a writer, but I just didn't see that quality in Eadlyn's story.I've said before that I think this side of the Selection process where the main character is the one doing the choosing had more of a sense of mystery about who she would end up with. Although that's true, Eadlyn hid her feelings from the reader (and herself) until page 167 of this book. It's a 278 page book. This gives us just over 100 pages to build a romance from the ground up, give it some obstacles, and resolve it. And instead of using those 100 pages to do that, this book decides to develop a sudden emphasis on the politics of this world. Maybe there are some statements here that are relevant to our current political state, but that's certainly not why I watch shows like The Bachelorette and read books like The Selection. I think my biggest complaint here is that due to how quickly things wrapped up, I was not given enough clues about how the future for these characters would play out. There is so much more to a story than the happy ending and I wish I had been given even the smallest inkling about what the fallout and future of this story might look like.Despite my dissatisfaction with how things wrapped up I thought Eadlyn's character was improved from the first book, the writing is easy to get sucked into as always, and the concise nature of the story was pretty appreciated overall. Maybe I didn't enjoy this romance, but I enjoyed getting sucked into a book. Also, maybe don't be like me and read this right after A Court of Mist and Fury because no romantic tension will ever compare to that book. *still fanning myself*The good news is, I am so excited to see what Kiera will write next!"},

I sure will miss these books, America, Marlee. Maxon. Erik and even Eadlyn. But we better not read about America's grand children. Even though I didn't really enjoy The Heir, The Crown was better.

The Crown should not have beenThe Crown, which is the final instalment of The Selection series, offers an unnecessary continuation. The story follows follows The Heir, which is set twenty years after The One. Featuring the unlikeable main protagonist, Eadlyn, The Crown tells the tale of her selection and living her royal life. It finishes the series of completely with a positive note, and continued to recycle ideas from the first three books. A disappointing book, but better than The Heir. The Crown should not have been written, but thankfully ended the opportunities for a sequel.The book begins the next day after the end of The Heir, when Queen America had a heart attack, underwent a surgery and was hospitalized in the hospital wing of the palace. Given the precarious situation, Eadlyn announces publicly on the Report that she will eliminate the Selected Suitors down to the six Elites: Gunner Croft, Kile Woodwork, Ean Cabel, Hale Garner, Fox Wesley and Henri Jaakoppi, together with his translator, Erik. She also announces that her father, King Maxon, wishes to remain by his wifeU+2019s side during her recovery, so he has named Eadlyn regent of IllU+00E9a with all the decisions and responsibilities of the position, until he can reclaim his title.Marid IllU+00E9a, son of August and Georgia IllU+00E9a, visits the palace to offer his wishes to Eadlyn for her motherU+2019s recovery. August IllU+00E9a had worked with Maxon to dissolve the castes, but after he complained that change wasnU+2019t happening fast enough, they had a big fight. Eventually, the IllU+00E9a family left the palace and they are in cold terms with the Schreaves ever since. However, Marid now wants his parents and EadlynU+2019s parents to reconcile. He is very beloved by the public. He offers his services to Eadlyn for whatever she may need.The next day, America awakes from her coma and Eadlyn, Kaden and Osten visit her. In the evening, Eadlyn goes out on a date with Kile. She reveals to him AhrenU+2019s letter where he had told her that people of IllU+00E9a dislike her. Kile comforts her and offers to kiss her, if she wants, to forget her problems for a while, saying that he will do anything she wants. She refuses, because she canU+2019t kiss him like itU+2019s nothing: he has become very important to her. She confesses that she likes him. He admits that he also likes her and he has already designed a summerhouse for her.Grandmother Singer visits the palace to see America. In the evening, Eadlyn meets accidentally Erik in the kitchen. They talk about Henri, EadlynU+2019s parents and the Selection. Eadlyn admits that she didnU+2019t want the Selection in the beginning and she is not in love with anyone yet. Erik offers his help to her for anything she may need.Gunner Croft meets Eadlyn and asks her if he can kiss her, to see if they are compatible. The kiss is fine, but nothing more than that, so he asks her permission and he leaves the Selection.Eadlyn has a date with Henri, with Erik by his side. The conversation is slightly uncomfortable and impersonal for Eadlyn and Henri, as they need translation constantly. Eadlyn ends up talking more to Erik than to Henri. So, Eadlyn asks Erik and Henri to give some Finnish lessons to her and to all Elite Suitors.During the first Finish lesson, Henri helps Eadlyn with her pronunciation by holding her face close to his. They almost kiss, before being interrupted by Erik. Marid IllU+00E9a proposes to Eadlyn to broadcast a town hall session where people from all social and economic backgrounds and former castes will personally talk with Eadlyn. This will show to the country that the palace listens to the citizens.During the broadcasted town hall session, things go quickly out of control, as the guests complain about the social stigma of the former lower castes. They demand more freedom and end up fighting with each other. Marid intervenes and defends the princess and eventually the meeting ends quite successfully.Eadlyn proposes to her father to let her officially ascend to the throne, so that he can be free of responsibilities, spend more time with his wife and both of them rest from their duties. Maxon is reluctant to let her reign during this difficult time, but then he accepts her proposal gratefully and gives her his signet ring. He announces it publicly on the Report and everyone on set warmly congratulate Eadlyn, which sends the message to the public that she is really capable and beloved.During another Finnish lesson, Eadlyn and Kile admit again that they have feelings for each other. Hale reveals to Eadlyn that he has realized he likes Ean, after Ean kissed him some days ago in the MenU+2019s parlor. He is afraid that this revelation might cost them their lives, since itU+2019s forbidden for the Suitors to have a relationship with anyone other than the princess. Moreover, there is stigma against same-sex couples in IllU+00E9a, because of the previous castes. Eadlyn is surprised, but she suggests that Hale and Ean will be eliminated separately after her coronation day, one week later. They can form a discreet relationship after the Selection, so that the public wonU+2019t accuse them for treason. Hale is very grateful and relieved.Kile comes to EadlynU+2019s room and he shares with her his plans to make a throne room for her, where she could receive and listen to her people. They remember their first ever kiss, when Kile was six and Eadlyn was four and he suddenly kissed her during their playing.Some days before the coronation, when Eadlyn tries on her ceremonial dress and cape, a tailor asks her help in ErikU+2019s room to convince him to wear a suit in the ceremony. Erik doesnU+2019t want to get dressed so officially like the other Elite. Eadlyn convinces him to wear the suit, simply with a different colored tie. Erik shows her a ring that his family had for many generations. He is supposed to give it to the girl he marries, but he gives it to Eadlyn for good luck. On impulse, Eadlyn leans in to kiss him, but the tailor enters the room again and interrupts them. Eadlyn realizes at that moment that she has feelings for Erik.In the coronation day, Ahren arrives in the palace with his wife, the French princess Camille de Sauveterre. The ceremony runs smoothly. Eadlyn officially says her vows and she is crowned Queen of IllU+00E9a. In the party later, Ahren apologizes to Eadlyn for leaving her so abruptly, but she is grateful because this incident helped her become less self-centered. Marid then proposes to Eadlyn that she should marry him and unite the IllU+00E9a and Schreave lines to make herself powerful and adored by the public. Otherwise, he will spread ill rumors about Eadlyn and there will be riots, since people love and listen to him. Eadlyn realizes that he actually wants the throne and she runs out of the party room in panic. Erik finds her at that moment. They hide inside the WomenU+2019s Room where they admit that they have feelings for each other and they kiss. They know however that they canU+2019t be together.Ean leaves the palace the next morning, just like he had arranged with Eadlyn. To stop MaridU+2019s plans, Eadlyn decides to finish the Selection in two weeks and get married soon. She will eliminate Fox and Hale and then choose publicly between Kile and Henri. In the same night, Eadlyn has a secret date with Erik in a safe room. They both talk about their parents. They reveal their full names: Eikko Petteri Koskinen and Eadlyn Helena Margarete Schreave. They agree that after the Selection is over, they will never meet each other again, but for that night they can kiss and be together.The next day, Eadlyn has a date with Fox. He declares his love for her, but she thinks that his feelings are forced and she feels guilty that she will eliminate him soon. Eadlyn watches on the news that Marid IllU+00E9a is buying engagement rings on camera, which could make the public want him as their prince consort. Under such circumstances, Eadlyn decides to pick her husband immediately and announce her engagement the next day. Josie Woodwork comforts her at that moment, apologizing for her previous behavior and for wanting to become a princess. She admits that she is the one who put KileU+2019s name in the Selection, because she wanted to become a princess, should Kile win the competition.Hale and Fox leave the palace at that same day. Eadlyn goes to KileU+2019s room to propose to him. Kile instead proposes to her, ready to marry her immediately and stop Marid. Eadlyn then declares that she canU+2019t marry him, because she canU+2019t let him sacrifice his future plans and make him stay in the palace for her sake. Kile insists that he wouldnU+2019t mind give everything up for her, but she likes him too much to let him do this. To make him leave, she banishes him from the palace for one year and sends him to Bonita for a housing project for the homeless, so he can pursue his architecture dreams.Before proposing to Henri, Eadlyn finds Erik. Both of them are heartbroken that they canU+2019t be together. They declare their love to each other and she gives him her signet ring. Having no other choice, Eadlyn proposes to Henri. He is very excited and accepts immediately.The next day, however, some minutes before the engagement announcement, Henri realizes that Erik and Eadlyn love each other and, even though he loves Eadlyn deeply, he decides not to marry her, so that she and Erik can be happy.Eadlyn secretly asks her fatherU+2019s opinion about this, since the rules of Selection donU+2019t allow the princess to marry a non-contestant. Maxon then reveals his back scars to her, telling her about the abuse he had suffered from his father as a child. The first time Maxon was caned was when he found out that his father, king Clarkson, had an affair with a woman, which resulted to an illegitimate daughter. The rules of the country state that all illegitimate royal children should be killed so that they wonU+2019t claim the throne. But when Maxon became king, he ignored the rules: he found his little half-sister and raised her in the palace near him, forever keeping her secret from the public. Eadlyn then understands that Lady Brice is MaxonU+2019s half-sister. In the same way that Maxon ignored the law, and America and Ahren have also broken some IllU+00E9aU+2019s rules, Maxon encourages Eadlyn to follow her heart and marry the man she loves, no matter the rules.Eadlyn then rushes back on the set of the Report and announces publicly that she loves Eikko Koskinen. She proposes to him and he happily accepts. Eadlyn also announces that IllU+00E9a will become a constitutional monarchy, with a prime minister, so that everyone can vote and decide for their future.In the epilogue, Eadlyn shares her thoughts about love and happily ever after, which often comes when you least expect it.After reading The Heir, my interest in the series was completely lost. The fourth instalment was undeniably terrible, and wasnU+2019t needed at all. Admittedly, I still wish Mrs Cass would have kept the series a trilogy, rather than writing the story of America and MaxonU+2019s daughter, Eadlyn, who is the worst protagonist I have ever encountered.In my review of the previous book, I keep going on about how selfish and rude she is. Thankfully, she has improved herself through the U+2018character developmentU+2019. However, in my eyes, she seemed fake and never acted out of love or sincerity, but out of duty. Eadlyn tries too hard to be likeable, and Mrs CassU+2019 attempt to redeem her, seems forced and rushed. This book is occurring the next day after the fourth book, and in that book, she was a terrible person and everyone hated her, but suddenly, everyone loves her and she becomes a kind person. I didnU+2019t buy it, but my dislike/hatred for Eadlyn has grown into a more civil relationship; I donU+2019t like her, but I donU+2019t dislike her. Since the beginning of the book, IU+2019ve had a negative opinion of it. Most matters of this book is terrible, and as I stated several times earlier, The Heir and The Crown should not have been written. It was a cheap attempt to milk more money out of a perfectly fine franchise, and turn it into an unnecessary book with recycled ideas. The plot from the first three books were used again, but slightly changed in order to seem U+2018newU+2019 and U+2018improvedU+2019. Again, I didnU+2019t buy it. The romance in The Crown was slightly better than The Heir, as it was now obvious who the love interest was. EadlynU+2019s relationship with Eikko is a significant part of the book, as she continues to struggle with her feelings for him. They are adorable together, but there is a certain lack of chemistry. He is a kind and helpful character, but his romantic relationship with Eadlyn shouldnU+2019t have happened. However, I was happy with the fact that Eadlyn didnU+2019t end up with Kile, as I never brought their friendship U+2013like the rest of the book. Kile and Eadlyn hated each other for years, and suddenly, a month later, they are best friends and love each other. If she chose him, I would have jumped off a cliff. There wasnU+2019t the U+2018love at first sightU+2019 bullshit, but the romance remained clichU+00E9 as it used the forbidden love conflict. In the end, she chooses Eikko, marries him and live happily ever after. Of course, she has to do in the most dramatic way as possible: seven minutes before she has to announce her engagement. Apparently, this was supposed to be the climax of the book, but it never made me excited nor eager to turn the page. This was a desperate attempt to end a conflict that never started. Moreover, Eadlyn went on for fifty pages about who she was going to marry. She kept talking to her friends and going on dates, but nothing was happening.Despite its short length, The Crown was dragged out and the U+2018plotU+2019 was nearly nonexistent. In the book before, EadlynU+2019s life was going downhill, and suddenly, everything is going great. Marid, who is the antagonist of the book, starts off with being charming, kind and supportive towards Eadlyn. He is the villain in disguise, and his role was terrible. Personally, I would have prefered him to remain kind and a friend/ally. The part where he blackmails her was a desperate attempt to spice up the book, and add a new drama to the story. America recovered, which is exactly what I expected. What would happen if Eadlyn and Maxon lost America? It would have complicated the story even further, and Mrs Cass wouldnU+2019t write the importance of dealing with losing a parent. Obviously, she had to take the easy way, and bullshit her way through it. It was lazily written, and kept using the same writing techniques the rest of the series had used. I have enjoyed Mrs CassU+2019 writing, but it remains the same and recycled. IU+2019m tired of it, and feels completely immature. ItU+2019s difficult to believe Eadlyn is 18-years-old based on her narrative, immaturity and personality.Maxon revealed he had a half-sister, who was the daughter of his fatherU+2019s mistress. Miss Brice was a supportive character, and a nice addition to the story. Honestly, I didnU+2019t expect her to be the half-aunt of Maxon and AmericaU+2019s children. I certainly didnU+2019t expect this plot twist, and I was pleasantly surprised. But not enough to redeem the rest of the story.Eadlyn chooses to make IllU+00E9a a constitutional monarchy, hence, having a prime minister. Why did it take so long for the royal family to realize all the shit they had done? To realize the people didnU+2019t like them? And to realize they havenU+2019t fixed everything they have caused? I have wanted this solution since the third book, and I actually believed it was going to happen then. In result, I was happy with the decision, but disappointed it took two books more for it to finally happen. There was too much fluff in The Crown. The entire book was filled with it, to the point that the plot disappeared. Eadlyn kept giggling, having meaningless and fun conversations, going on dates and having random banters with people. It was too much, and lost its focus, if there was one to begin with. I was cringing throughout the book, mostly because of EadlynU+2019s behavior. America and MaxonU+2019s parenting improved. I had a major problem with their behavior towards Eadlyn in the fourth book, but Maxon was actually a great and supportive father. He told her the story of his past, including parts that was never revealed in the first three books. America also seems kinder towards her, and doesnU+2019t think as much of the royal image, that started the entire selection for Eadlyn. I was hoping for a better relationship with her parents, and all it took for that to happen, was that Eadlyn had to become a queen. That was another fail in the book, out of many. To all those who had similar negative feelings after reading this book, I am completely in agreement with you. To those who liked it and claim that the negative reviews are from readers who didn't get what they wanted in the book, I would say you are completely right. We didn't. And at least on my part, it wasn't that the author didn't choose the particular love interest I wanted. It was because it wasn't a good book. I'm not an author, but I am a reader, and the key elements that make me fall in love with a good book are deep and realistic character development, meaningful world development, an engaging and well-supported, well-paced plot & a writing style that doesn't get in the way of the story.The only character that didn't feel completely two-dimensional in this book was Eadlyn, and even her character development was lacking. I was so disappointed that at the end she was still focused on herself, and how she kept going on about how she was the most powerful person. Eadlyn married whom she was in love with, and changed the government in order to avoid responsibility. Yes, I wanted to change to occur, but she did because she couldnU+2019t handle becoming queen. Her eagerness to become queen was selfish and she casually asked her father for the throne while he was taking a break, caring for her motherU+2026 that was terrible of her, but she got it. Ultimately, she got what she wanted. The rest of the other characters were as flat as a piece of paper, even the ones who had more dimension in the previous book.I wasn't as bothered by a lack of world development since I already knew the world from the other books, but I think if this was a standalone book, I would have an incomplete picture. It would have helped if Eadlyn could have gotten out of the palace more, and communicate with her people. The plot consisted of Eadlyn, playing with politics, then playing with suitirs, later she has a crises and solve it by getting married. Of course, she gets married to the person she wants to marry because she is the queen, changes the way the country runs and that is the end.Eadlyn never had an emotional attachment to the men who was part of the Selection. None of them mattered to her; Eric did, but she fell in love with him. There was a potential plot in the politics, but it was poorly supposed, felt contrived and rushed. It felt immature, and I donU+2019t believe that is how politic/royal meetings run. I donU+2019t remember this being an issue in any of the other books, but I found myself thinking a few times that what I had just read felt choppy and over-simplified, as if it had been written in a hurry by an inexperienced author U+2013with lack of research in the politics department. There werenU+2019t any major editing errors, but the writing just got in the way.In conclusion, this was an unnecessary continuation of The Selection, but did tie the story up nicely. Eadlyn had her character development, which wasnU+2019t done in a believable manner, and fell in love with the wrong person but ended up marrying him in the end. The drama in the plot was weak, and was supported by a shitty villain, whom didnU+2019t bring any twists into the stories. Characters in The Crown are boring, dry people with no personality, and I felt this story was extremely rushed and poorly written. The entire book was a poor attempt to finish the story, and should have never been written."},

UNPOPULAR OPINION RIGHT HERE!!!!Here it is after a year we FINALLY get the conclusion to this series. I have absolutely loved the original 3 books from this series. IU+2019m gonna be honest though as much as itU+2019s been fun rehashing another selection with swapped sides IU+2019ve also very much not enjoyed these last two books.First of all I think Cass is a great storyteller. I donU+2019t however feel like she is the best of writers. That isnU+2019t to say that IU+2019m going to stop reading her books, on the contrary! Because sheU+2019s a great teller of tales I will pick up anything she writes!I really struggled liking the guys. The guys from this view of the selection wereU+2026.too soft? eh maybeU+2026not manly? noU+2026 too feminine? maybeU+2026 they all just didnU+2019t seem to act like guys! I am in no way, shape, or form suggesting that men cannot be soft or have a feminine side/touch. However I just feel like in these last two books of the series I had a really hard time connecting with any of the characters. I do feel like she did a great job with keep their personalities separate though!The character development for me was too fast. Things just changed in a matter of paragraphs. I have a hard time believing that Kile; who disliked Eadlyn for so long all of a sudden finds himself really enjoying myself with her and liking her and possibly even loving her! NO WAY it doesnU+2019t happen THAT FASTU+2026does it? Overall I had a hard time enjoying the characters and getting involved in their stories. I found them to be too unbelievable. HOWEVER, I will say that I had a hard time liking Eadlyn in The Heir. This one I will admit I liked her A LOT better.The pacing was super fast. Things just wrapped up so fast and too conveniently with a nice pretty bow on top that I felt lost some of itU+2019s magic. IU+2019d be happier even if there was yet another book just so the pacing, character development were more evenly spaced and flowed slower to enjoy the story and their struggles. ButU+2026whatever.The romance? well, it was okayU+2026again WAY TO FAST for me. I like to enjoy a slow burning romance. This happened way to fast for my liking. I did enjoy the turn of events in this regard though IU+2019m not going to lie I expected on way and was surprised it see it go another way.Overall, it was an okay book. IU+2019m very much interested in seeing what Kiera Cass has up her sleeve. IU+2019ve really enjoyed this series overall! But IU+2019m also happy to see it done.Sexual Content: mildLanguage: mildViolence: mildDrugs/Alcohol: mild"},

Maxon who is under a serious amount of stress makes a decision which throws Eadlyn into the deep end like she wanted but is it all too much? With an old ally trying to become a new suitor and with The Selection needing to come to an end who will Eadlyn choose?! Let the heartache begin!I honestly don't know what to make of this book, I hated it at first I found it slow and Princess Bitchlyn really got to me so much I wanted to scream every time she spoke down to someone or referred to herself in the third person... If I could have set the book on fire with eyes I would have... many times. Then I would start to enjoy the book, then I would hate it again then I would give up reading it and leave it for a few days and decide to go back to it, I was at war with myself.I wanted to hate Eadlyn I really did, and to be honest I hated her mostly through The Heir and at the start of The Crown but near the end of the last book she started to grow on me, I could see her emotions come out and I really liked it but I found it to be rushed and pushed on to get it finished which I found a complete shame because I really started to see a side of her I wanted to know.I loved our Elite boys they were amazing, they all loved Eadlyn so much yet she would let them in then all a sudden make out they were enemies... then act like normal again. It was weird! it was like Kiera had forgotten only two sentences ago she had said how could she trust these people they had lied to her made a fool of her then she's secretly making out with someone in a dark room... ok then! Henri & Kile were my favourites from the beginning I loved them more and more through the book, not only were they perfect gentleman they worshiped the ground Eadlyn walked on.***SPOILERS PLEASE DON'T READ THIS PART IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK**(view spoiler)[Ok so let's touch on Erik, I don't usually ever write to spoil a book but I have to make my feelings clear on this. He was there to be Henri's translator yet he acted like a snake the whole time even putting in about how Henri and Eadlyn would find it hard to communicate, his little passes, forgetting his place, snaking someone who trusted him, this made me hate the book. I stopped reading it for a nearly a week hoping that maybe I could bring myself to like him but I don't know I just feel he betrayed Henri in such a horrible way and I don't know if I can ever get passed that feeling! (hide spoiler)]Be warned the last half of the book is really fast paced and that is where everything happens, I hated people one minute, I loved them the next. I was breaking my heart with tears down my face and finding myself willing for Eadlyn to be happy (god what is happening?!). Do I think this should have been a part of The Selection? No, I believe Kiera should have stopped at The One and made this a spin-off, nonetheless it was an ok read.Check out my blog! www.amandaminnockx.tumblr.com thanks :) !

Eadlyn, which was unbearable in The Heir, wasn't even the worst thing about this book. I honestly think Kiera Cass was (and is) the worst thing about this book. The only queer relationship is used as a plot device. The author succeeded at the hard job of portraying the only non-english speaking characters as someone mentally challenged. The entire world-building part is something we really don't see, because who the fuck cares? This book was written not with hands but with a foot (not even two feet, A FUCKING SINGLE FOOT) so it's not like she really wanted to write more.

Nope, I didn't really enjoy it as much as I thought that I would. And honestly, I thought that The Crown would do much better than The Heir. But I was wrong. Even though in The Heir, Eadlyn was such a brat and a know-it-all, I would choose The Heir any day over The Crown. The Heir was MUCH BETTER that The Crown.-Eadlyn... Where do I start with this one? Um, I HATE Eadlyn. Ok, hate is such a strong word. Maybe the word 'dislike' would be better. I already didn't like her in the first book but after completing this book, it gave me more reason to dislike her character. I feel as though Eadlyn only thinks of herself. You may disagree with me but I honestly think she only cares for her and no one else. Eadlyn is also a brat and an idiot. She doesn't seem to give a care in the world about her country. Eadlyn, in my opinion, DOESN'T make a good queen. Ok, before you yell at me, I know that she made that big change in the end about (view spoiler)[changing the country to a constitutional democracy (hide spoiler)] but did she think of that on her own? Nope. She needed her own people of her country to persuade her to make such a decision. During that meeting with the country's citizens coming to talk to her, it was their idea. I guess in a way, she did follow through on their requests but isn't it pretty obvious that countries nowadays aren't successful under a king and queen? Well, I could go on and on about how stupid her character is. I'll just stop here then. -The characters in general... Besides Eadlyn, the other characters in The Crown, especially the Selected, seem to be dead. When I was reading, it felt as though that had no emotion and was empty inside. There really was no solid ground for any of the characters, preferably the Selected. They just seemed dead inside and out to me. Anyone feel the same way? -The plot line... This was a major problem for me. It seemed as though the plot had no structure at all. Things were flying all over the place and nothing mentioned in the book seemed to fit into the story. Basically, it was super windy and the plot line was flying all over the place, going in all sorts of different directions. Anyhow, I felt as though Cass could've done MUCH better with the conclusion to The Selection series. :( -Lastly, the winner... (view spoiler)[WHAT THE F**K?! I honestly didn't expect Erik to win over Eadlyn's heart. I mean, the guy wasn't even a part of her Selection in the first place. He was just a translator, for goodness sakes! I was rooting for Kile Woodwork and I'm just super disappointed with how the ending turned out. I really thought that Kile might've had a chance. I guessed wrong. I don't need to say anymore. I wanted Kile and that didn't happen. Erik wasn't even a main character! Of all the guys she could've chosen, she chooses Erik 'Not-Part-Of-The-Selection-Just-A-Translator-Guy' Koskinen.

Yes guys, that's a smiling Kanye West. Enjoy it, they're rare.This book hooked me in right from it's depressing start, and I feel like I've watched Eadlyn grow from spoiled brat to magnificent Queen the time the book ends. I loved every minute of it. The good moments, the bad, the funny bits:...'No-one will take you seriously!...' 'Fine,' I responded calmly. 'You're fired.'Coddly laughed, looking at the other gentlemen at the table. 'You can't fire me, Your Highness.'I tilted my head, staring at him. 'I assure you, I can. There's no-one here who outranks me at the moment, and you are easily replaceable.' I felt so bad for her at times, there's was just way too much pressure put on her for someone her age. She tried to even change herself for the sake of her people's approval.'Yes, it's all about their perception of me. They think I'm too cold. The most absolute way to refute that would be to get married. They think that I'm too masculine. The most absolute way to refute that is to be a bride.'Surprisingly enough, the Selection bit wasn't important in this book - in fact, majority of the plot centered on Eadlyn and her slow, painful process of being a 'good' Queen in the people's eyes. She attends conferences. She listens as her people tell her their problems, and is disrespected again and again, by those who think she's too young, too 'bratty' and too inexperienced.I won't spoil anymore! You have to read the book to find out what happens."},

I mean, the writing is kind of terrible. Every time I pick up one of these books I feel like I'm reading fanfiction. But along with the unrealistic dialogue, ridiculous scenarios, and silly behavior comes an unputdownable quality.I won't argue that this is amazingly written literature - in fact that couldn't be further from the truth. While I enjoy detailed, complex books, I liked The Crown in a different way. The characters weren't intricate and the plot wasn't a masterpiece - but it was so darn fun to read.I think I can say about this series: \"It's so bad it's good.\" I'm just glad I finished this cute, chick lit book feeling satisfied and with fond memories."},

This in no way impacted on my view. After reading book 4, The Heir, I was a bit apprehensive about reading this book. To me, the main character, Eadlyn, was annoying, even more so than her mother had been, and I didn't know if I could cope with another book from her PoV. However, I was pleasantly surprised with her character growth this time around.After the shock ending of The Heir, Eadlyn has cut her suitors down to 6, and is currently regent of Illea whilst her father is at her mother's bedside. She knows that the people aren't really fans of hers, and needs to endear herself to the population, or she'll never be safe. She starts off struggling with her new found responsibility, but soon comes into her own as regent, and feels like she will be a Queen that the people deserve.Out of the final 6, the front runners have always been, for me, Kile, Hale, or Henri. Erik, Henri's translator, was also a favourite, but he didn't exactly count, because he wasn't a member of the Selected. I felt like Eadlyn's choices throughout the process of the Selection were sound, and even though there was one bit, about 75% of the way through, that I thought it all was going to hell, I was happy with how she eventually decided on who her Prince Consort would be.Eadlyn has really grown as a person in the book, and even though she was annoying in the first book, this time she was interesting to read. For the final book in a five book series, I felt like The Crown was slightly too short, but, at the same time, everything was resolved, and I couldn't have asked for a more rounded and well constructed ending. I'd say that even if you weren't too keen on The Heir, give this a try, as you might be pleasantly surprised, like I was."},

This much of a response is unheard of for me. Almost every day, a few more people like it, or someone else actively advocates for Kile or Erik and sends up a prayer in the hopes America doesn't die. I've loved hearing everyone's predictions and hopes and dreams over the course of a year in waiting for what may or may not be the last of the Selection books, given the track record.Second, I wish it didn't have to end this way.I really enjoyed the original three Selection books. Sure, America could be annoying, but as long as you didn't take them too seriously, they were quick, fun reads.But The Heir was not a good read for me, for reasons I have already stated in my review.So let's return to the points of improvement I listed here, the day I finished The Heir, in optimism for its sequel.U+2022 Eadlyn to stop being spoiled and do something unselfish for her people.By the end of the book, Eadlyn says she's learned her lesson, and that she's more aware of how privileged she is. But let's take a look.  I stepped into the bath, noting there was no lavendar, no bubbles, no anything to sweeten the water. Eloise was quiet and fast, but she was no Neena. I sighed.So miss Princess--excuse me--Queen Eadlyn just can't enjoy her little bath without all its fluff, and she can't be bothered to just go and get it herself. That sounds like entitlement to me.And does Eadlyn actually \"do something unselfish for her people\"?Not really. She spends the entire book worrying about what they think of her rather than actually trying to help them. The two instances where she does try to reach out weren't even her idea. The first, the town hall meeting, was Marid's idea, and, as he points out, he was the one who had to save it in the end. The other instance, which never played out in the book, was Kile's idea for a throne room where the people could regularly come and talk to Eadlyn about their problems to get them fixed. This was what inspired Eadlyn (view spoiler)[in the constitutional monarchy aspect, (hide spoiler)] which was a nice touch, but, again, not really her idea.An additional idea, proposed by again Kile, was the housing project. But instead of actively taking a hand in it herself, (view spoiler)[Eadlyn banishes Kile from the palace and makes him do it on his own. (hide spoiler)]U+2022 Eadlyn to actually interact with her people on any level.See above.U+2022 A good old-fashioned, knee-slappin, heck of a time ball.Does the coronation ball count? I guess.U+2022 Henri to find a cute maid to love.I guess (view spoiler)[it was really too much of a close call for Henri to have time \"to find a maid to love.\" Maybe in book six. (hide spoiler)]U+2022 Ahren to come back and have character development.Oh, Ahren came back. But did he have character development?I say not really. And I attribute it to the fact that Ahren and Eadlyn's relationship was never really solidified in The Heir. Eadlyn spent a good portion of this book lamenting over Ahren's departure, but it all felt very fake to me. Eadlyn in The Crown claimed she needed Ahren, that she relied on Ahren, but Eadlyn in The Heir hardly every interacted with him. She only every really mentioned Ahren in regard to his relationship with Camille. Therefore, it was hard to take their sudden closeness seriously.U+2022 Either Erik or Kile winning the selection.I think we all saw that one coming.U+2022 Kile builds something cute to help Eadlyn.Kile builds houses for those living in poverty, which is way better than building something for Eadlyn.U+2022 Josie to get seriously told off by Eadlyn.This one, in fact, has changed for me, and it's due to something someone commented on here a while back.This person pointed out that it was always Eadlyn being unfair to Josie, not the other way around, and after thinking about it, I agree. It especially became apparent to me in some things Eadlyn said to Josie early on. While Josie was immature and annoying, she still never deserved to be treated so harshly by Eadlyn, because all she ever wanted was to be just like her.So I was very pleased with the way things turned out between them. This was one point I was worried Kiera would drop the ball on, but she pulled through for me.U+2022 Something exciting with Ean.Something exciting most certainly did happen with Ean, but it was definitely not what I originally had in mind.Ean's character quite honestly was disappointing for me. When Epic Reads was marketing The Heir they uploaded a bunch of videos that were mock interviews with some of the more important boys in the Selection. Ean was one of them, and his video, which portrayed him as a pompous little snake, got me really excited for some drama being thrown down.But with the exception of Eadlyn's first meeting with him, he doesn't do anything at all in either books. He's always in the background. He might as well have been one of the boys Eadlyn sent home for all he's actually mentioned. I'm not even sure Eadlyn ever went on a date with him, and yet somehow he managed to (view spoiler)[make it to the Elite. (hide spoiler)] Kiera really dropped the ball on this one.U+2022 America not to die.Honestly, after thinking about it, I knew (view spoiler)[there was a zero percent chance America was going to die. No way in heck was Kiera going to kill off a character so precious to her. (hide spoiler)]In conclusion, as much regard as I have for Kiera as a person, and as much as I did like the original three books, these last two installments have caused everything to go to pieces. I'm not even sure there ever was a plot in these; most of it has been Eadlyn continually complaining about how \"hard\" her life is. What little drama exists feels fake and underdeveloped, and the world-building has gone so far under that we didn't even make it out of the palace in this book.I mentioned the other day to a friend that reading this book has felt like reading fanfiction. It has all the plot holes, cheesiness, and enough of the original characters being married and having kids to give it that feel.But, above all, Maxon Shreave will always and forever be life.------------------------------------------------  PREREADING5/11/15things i would like in this book:- eadlyn to stop being spoiled & do something unselfish for her people- eadlyn to actually interact with her people on any level- a good old-fashioned, knee-slappin, heck-of-a-time ball- henri to find a cute maid to love- ahren come back & have character development- either erik or kile winning the selection- kile builds something cute to help eadlyn- josie to get seriously told off by eadlyn- something exciting with ean- aMERICA NOT TO DIE ???[in the constitutional monarchy aspect, (hide spoiler)][Eadlyn banishes Kile from the palace and makes him do it on his own.

I was never really a fan of The Heir or Eadlyn like I was with The Selection and America. The only reason I kept up with series after The One was because like many others, I was curious as to how everyone from the original trilogy grew up to be.In all honesty, I should've just stopped after the third book. I don't want to say that The Heir and The Crown ruined The Selection for me but in a way it did. Instead of believing that everybody lived happily ever after once Maxon and America became king and queen and the caste system was eliminated, The Heir just sort of wipes that all away like happily ever after never even happened.The One was such a bittersweet ending to a fun trilogy and The Crown with its 278 pages wasn't going to top it at all. Not by a long shot.Nothing really happened in The Crown. To be honest, I thought this book was such a waste because nothing worthy or significant occurred. Sure, Eadlyn was less of a brat in this book but I'm still not very fond of her. On top of that, I thought it was absolutely preposterous that Maxon stepped down and gave up his title for Eadlyn to rule. That was by far the most unrealistic thing I've ever heard. No king is going to give up his duties because he was stressing about his queen's recovery or because he wants a normal life with his wife. Tough shit. That's like saying you're giving up being a parent because you're stressed out about having kids. Putting the fate of your whole country on Eadlyn? Good luck with that.I also felt that the ending was really rushed. Too many things were resolved too quickly and too easily that added to the unrealism that I was struggling with.On a positive note, I did enjoy the fact that Eadlyn's choice broke away from tradition. Was her choice a surprise? No, not really. From the very beginning, I knew it would come down to one specific person but I was curious as to how Kiera Cass was going to make it happen.The Selection was one of the first series that got me into reading Young Adult. Though it is far from the best series out there, I will always have an attachment to the first three books of The Selection. The Heir and The Crown may not be up to par with Maxon and America's story, but I still found it bittersweet that The Selection is finally over for good."},

Taking this into consideration, this review will resemble half an omen to this fifth installment and half a regret for what it did not come to fruition in its prequel, but only to highlight that this book exceeded my expectations and made me fall in love again with its world. Unlike in The Heir, I loved Eadlyn. She let go of her petty, egotistical, self-centered and vain antics in order to graciously transform into a more than capable young woman, leader and Queen. Yeah yeah, her character-development was speeded up to supersonic mode, but for once I didn't mind. She showed her thoughtfulness, her ambition, her intelligence and her strong personality. I admired the fact that she wants to do good by everyone around her and that she tries to mend her flaws. Regardless, she took a colossal departure from the stoic, stuck-up and artificial princess and became an oddly organic person, beautifully encapsulated through the integrity to her own heart and moral code. Unlike in The Heir, I didn't check the page count every two minutes to dreadfully discover there was still a long way to go until the finish. I was hooked and I read it easily, eager to see what's in store next. Tremendously enjoyable.Unlike in The Heir, I could connect to this bunch of boys. Instead of 35, there were only 6 left in the picture. Each of them (and here I'm talking about the ever-wonderful Hale, Kile, Ean, Henri and Erik) became amazing in their own way and right. Unlike in The Heir, I was actually surprised by some revelations. Marid and Brice, especially. And Maxon shocked me with his introspective tales. Unlike in The Heir, there were sweet relationships truly taking root. Deep, heartfelt friendships and dynamics that somehow evolved or appeared out of the blue only to fit the bill perfectly. Hale & Eady. Hale & Ean. Kile & Eady. Erik & Henri. Henri & Eady. Josie & Eady. Erik & Eady. Brice & Eady. Aspen & Eady. Unlike in The Heir, I did not curse the decision to expand the series from the original trilogy. This closure, this grand second finale somehow tied up the loose ends of The One by making sure certain matters were addressed, political ones, LGBT ones, feminism ones and discriminatory ones. I finally understood that we couldn't leave things at how they were with the initial 'last book'. Unlike in The Heir, there was so much more of the young Maxon and America we all know. Seriously, all the glimpses into their fairy tale of a love story made my heart burst free. Maxon fretting over Mer and going borderline insane about her health was just too cute to handle. I'm glad they're happy and don't paint me foolish just because they're works of fiction, but in my mind they exist vividly and that's of the utmost importance. Unlike in The Heir, I wasn't constantly exhausted about the sad and ill-fated attempts at romance. This time, it all flourished naturally, because the focus was on the worthy and so a cute and amazing and awesome and lovely couple became canon. And speaking about that particular pairing, I SHIP IT. Like The Heir, don't expect this book to suddenly be a complex piece of literature, because surely it is not. It fits the style of the series, so it's one for the heart. It's 100% drama and teen romance. It's light. It's quick. It's totally YA. It's a great read for a spring afternoon. It's the kind of book that has you smiling, daydreaming and relaxing. Unlike The Heir. Unlike the Heir, The Crown was so much better. Infinitely better. I urge you to read it and see for yourself but I have faith that you'll love it bunches.Bye, Illea. For real now. ENJOY! "},

Finding the right guy for her isn't easy. Whatever choice she makes, she must follow what her heart speaks and unexpectedly changes everything.For me, the conclusion to this series is bittersweet. I'm going to be honest, I do like Kiera Cass but I have to say I'm disappointed with its ending. Like, really frustrated that I almost throw the book across the room because I'm holding to my thoughts and it ended not the way I expected or wanted. At the same time, I don't want to be selfish and one sided with the situation. I hope you'll understand my feeling of when-your-ship-didn't-sail. I'm still on denial stage and I'll get over this soon. I actually see it coming but I keep fighting the bad feeling, you know? Still, I am glad to see Eadlyn Schreave's character developed into a fine lady. She handled the situations maturely and earned my respect. Here I am, seeing the other perspective and tried to understand why it ended up like... THAT. I know some of you rooted for (view spoiler)[ Erik/Eikko  (hide spoiler)] to win and I respect that.

It was like this...Perfect comparison.I really do not like Eadlyn as a character at all because she has no personality! All I hear out of her mouth is awkward, out of place dialogue that leaves me cringing. Everyone was telling her how great of a queen she'd be and I was there thinking, \"Why would you guys happily trade Eadlyn in place of America and Maxon???\". SHE IS SUCH A FLAT CHARACTER.There is seriously no character depth in this book. We don't get to dive into any of the suitors' backgrounds, and really, we don't get to hear that much from the suitors at all! No personalities, just smiling faces who constantly said things to Eadlyn like \"I understand you completely\", \"I'm so sorry about your mom\", and \"You'll make a great queen\". Okay, I realize that those are nice things to say about a girl, but when it comes to reading, that is so boring! Especially when EVERY SINGLE GUY SAYS IT LIKE TEN TIMES.Alright, let me just get it out. I hate it when characters are overly nice all the time and have no kind of dark side to them. Character flaws. Yeah, that's it. And backstories, which this book had none of. CHARACTERS WHO ARE OVERLY NICE AND CHEERY ALL THE TIME ARE JUST SO BORING. Some conversations went sorta like this:\"Hello Eadlyn,\" said suitor.\"Hello,\" said Eadlyn.\"You look lovely today,\" said suitor.\"Oh wow thank you so much!\" said Eadlyn.\"I'm sorry about your mom,\" said suitor.\"Aw thank you...she's starting to get better,\" said Eadlyn.\"That's good,\" said suitor.\"Yeah,\" said Eadlyn.\"Nice seeing you, bye,\" said suitor.\"Bye,\" said Eadlyn.WASN'T THAT EXCITING OR WHAT.Alright, I'm gonna spice up this scene for the fun of it, keeping the suitors lines, but changing Eadlyn's.\"Hello Eadlyn,\" said suitor.\"Hey ya fuck tard,\" said Eadlyn.\"You look lovely today,\" said suitor.\"Yeah I just took a shit on the crapper and thought of you\" said Eadlyn.\"I'm sorry about your mom,\" said suitor.\"If I fucking hear that one more time I will stick my tiara up yo ass,\" said Eadlyn.\"That's good,\" said suitor.\"Bitch what the fuck did I just say,\" said Eadlyn.\"Nice seeing you, bye,\" said suitor.\"Stfu,\" said Eadlyn.NOW THAT IS GOLD.Alright, moving on. So apparently Hale and Ean are gay for each other. Before I go on, let me just say, I am not against homosexuality. But, when we found this out, I was so mad because of how random and out of place it was. Okay Kiera, so to make this faster to write, you're going to just have two of the elite fall for each other and get away with it so easily? When Hale told Eadlyn that he was in love with Ean I literally said \"What the fuck?\" while reading. Whatever, on to Erik.I knew that Erik was going to be with Eadlyn in the end, like how obvious could it be? And it happened so fast. He's probably the least flat character out of all the characters (but he's still flat). Eadlyn literally chose to be with him in like the last five pages. What really bothered me though, was how everyone was just fine and dandy with it. When Henri found out, he's like \"Ok, I see the love. Be together. I love you guys, you're s'cute. Henri out.\"........okay Henri. And when Eadlyn announced to the millions of viewers watching the broadcast that she was going to choose Erik (a guy no one even knew existed and was obviously not in the selection), everyone was just cheering and clapping. I don't know about you but if I were watching the Bachelorette and Jojo picked a guy that wasn't even one of her choices and wasn't on the show I'd be like \"Who dis bitch\". And the media would also go ballistic. But no, everyone was okay with it and didn't think twice.And then, it was just like \"The end, that's it, that's the book\". And I just sat there like \"Wat\".Yeah, pretty much. I was hoping this book was going to be a good conclusion to the series, but overall, it wrecked it for me. It was so boring. The writing was bad. The characters were flat. The plot was dull. Nothing really happened. Goodbye forever, Selection series."},

This young woman holds the weight of her country on her shoulders. Her mother lies in the hospital with her husband by her side. Eadlyn has always known the love her parents shared but watching her father at her motherU+2019s side shows her a depth she hadnU+2019t realized. Could she ever have that with one of these men from the Selection? She never even wanted to be a part of this but now finds herself longing for what her parents have.   U+201CI had power and no idea how to use it. I was a ruler who didnU+2019t know how to lead. I was a twin who was on her own. I was a daughter with missing parents. I had a half dozen suitors and wasnU+2019t sure how to be in love.U+201DEadlyn is acting as Regent in her fatherU+2019s absence. She has trained since birth to someday take over the kingdom but she wasnU+2019t prepared for the full responsibility just yet. At the same time, she is somehow trying to find time to get to know the remaining men. She is developing feelings for some of these men but could it be love? Of course, with power, come those that want to take it from you. Someone posing as a friend tries to manipulate Eadlyn and the public to put himself into a place to assume power. With public opinion of Eadlyn less than what she would want it to be, this puts her in a very precarious position. Of course, love canU+2019t be predicted. And for Eadlyn, it came as both a surprise and a shock. But what should have been the most beautiful moment of her life will force her to make a decision that will possible be the biggest sacrifice she will ever make for her kingdom.  U+201CIn an instant, everything in the room came alive. Like the sunshine had a melody and the sounds of footsteps had a texture I could feel in my fingertips each time anyone moved. The world woke up when I looked at him.U+201DCould these feelings just be her own? Or does he feel the same way as well? Does she even dare to voice her feelings or should she keep them locked up inside?As I said above, I love this series. I feel like the ending was perfect. Since itU+2019s been awhile since the last book, I donU+2019t remember it being so poetic. KieraU+2019s way with words in this one was just beautiful. With all the responsibility Eadlyn was forced to take on, I wished she had more time with her gentlemen but in the end, I donU+2019t know if that would have mattered. As of late, IU+2019ve gotten away from young adult. But there was no way I couldnU+2019t follow this through to see how it ended. So if you havenU+2019t started this series and are on the fence about it, let me give you a not so gentle nudge and get started. Now there will be no waits between books for you to see what happens next. And if you think of it, let me know how you like it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. Thank you to Kiera Cass for such a wonderful, beautiful series."},

I'm sorry, but if you've read my review, you'll know why. If you've read The Heir and were disappointed with it, then you'll know why as well. In The Heir, Eadlyn is just rude, stubborn, foolish and spoiled. She has a bitchy attitude and wondered why everyone hated her or had some dislikes of her. But in The Crown, there are some changes.I knew that after reading and finishing The One, the series should've stopped there. It should've stayed as a trilogy. I mean, the main focus was on America and Maxon. Writing 2 stories about their daughter wasn't really worth it. Instead of keeping the happiness flowing everywhere, everything sort of faded because of these 2 other books. Instead of wishing more moments with America and Maxon, we get moments with their daughter and her own selection, even though she didn't want it. Instead of romance, we get boring dates, awkward ones as well, a boring plot, boring main characters and nothing in comparison to The Selection, The Elite and The One.I will admit, this story did have its improvements like the other ones did. I mean, in The Heir, a lot of us see Eadlyn as a spoiled brat. I'm sorry, but spoiled explains her a lot in that book. But in The Crown, we notice she makes improvements in her life. She isn't stuck up and spoiled all the time, she doesn't treat everyone like shit, she tries to follow the same moves her father did when he was just a prince, and she shows some care and sympathy for the Selected boys.Nothing really happened in The Crown. There weren't any shocking moments or decisions that were about to leave my jaw hanging open. Honestly, I knew it was all coming. Eadlyn's choice didn't leave me disappointed. I was disappointed since my ship sank and didn't keep floating on the ocean but I didn't completely blame her. Her choice felt right and even though there is no other book coming up, I feel like in the minds of fans of this book can imagine the happy life they'll be living.As to the things that did upset me, even though it's really just one, I think making Eadlyn queen at a young age when both her parents are alive was stupid and ridiculous. Just because your parents are carrying stress on their shoulders and your mom is in a poor condition of recovering, that doesn't mean you give your royal title to your daughter who still doesn't even have a soulmate and doesn't even have a clue on how she would rule the country. Maxon literally gave up on his life to take care of America but then they didn't even know how Eadlyn would handle it. That's just stupid!Other than saying negative things about this book, I was glad Grandma Singer was back, new characters were mentioned and met, and new truths were discovered. I was glad Kiera brought some people back and made some changes in the ones we met in the previous book. I was glad there were character developments although they weren't the best. I don't consider Kiera Cass one of my favorite authors simply because I really only loved The One. I will continue to love that one but only that one. Admittedly, reading her novels are like reading fan fictions. The writing is too cute and written in a quirky way for teenage girls looking for romance that is discovered in a way that is not discovered here. I guess The Selection really is over now. I can't really emphasize the disappointment I was left with this book. I was expecting so much more even though at the same time, I wasn't. The series should've ended with The One. Period. I really hope that if Kiera Cass decides to work on something new, its different. Even if the main genre is romance, I just hope the writing improves and it doesn't just focus on one thing. If she is planning on working on something new for us, I just hope it's worth it and I hope my doubts for it stay high. I'm just hoping. Goodbye IllU+00E9a. For real now, and maybe for the best."},

She never takes the easy path and this allows her to write interesting storylines and events. IU+2019ve always been pleasantly surprised by her stories and avidly engaged by her characters. I can describe The Crown using varied words, but good is not one of them.As I began reading this book, I felt that there was something missing. I want to stress that even this early on, I wasnU+2019t planning on rating this book with 5 stars, which is odd for me because IU+2019m an devoted fan of this series. ItU+2019s true that the fourth book in the series was a bother to read because of Eadlyn, but I still admired her character. She had a different type of personality, one that a lot of people would not appreciate, but her thoughts and actions made sense when they were strung together. Her personality wasnU+2019t an issue in this book, though. It was evident from the beginning that there were a lot of missing information and that most of the scenes were rushed. There were some scenes where she was suddenly in a date with someone without even an introduction that she was going to one. And said date would end abruptly and nothing interesting actually happens. I understand if this is a tactic to undermine the date, but as readers of EadlynU+2019s selection, it also undermines her emotions over her suitors. This, I think, should not have been done because she repeats every now and then that she cares deeply for them U+2013 even going so far as to say that she loves all of them. The lack of focus on the dates make these claims easily refutable.There was also a huge deficiency in character development. There were certain things in the book that were revealed rather abruptly. If you think about it, the clipped dates should have given way to more space for the development of other aspects of the story, but it didnU+2019t. These revelations caused so much turmoil in me that I was unable to continue right away. I was so pissed! I never curse in reviews, but that development was COMPLETE BULLSHIT. IU+2019m not really picky when it comes to characters, as long as thereU+2019s evidence of how so and so could have happened, IU+2019m okay with it. And yes, there were scenes that could have lead up to that kind of development, but EADLYN WASNU+2019T IN THAT STATE OF EMOTION. AT ALL.I canU+2019tU+2026 this book is a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMET.I love the America & Maxon moments, but if Kiera Cass really needed more space for character development, then they should have just cut out these scenes from the book. HELL, I would have preferred another book if that would let me avoid this mess of a rushed book. IU+2019m thoroughly disappointed. I tried to see how what happened had happened (avoiding spoilers is hard, whew!) but I just couldnU+2019t. I even tried to accept it, like U+2013 okay, you canU+2019t do anything anymore, this is the flow of the story. But I was at such at an emotional disconnect by that point that I couldnU+2019t enjoy the story anymore.(view spoiler)[The Marid plotline was so obvious that I canU+2019t believe Eadlyn missed it. And she only started to take notice of it when she was drunk! Also, IU+2019m not sure what constitutional monarchy entails, but by voting for a prime minister, it would appear that with MaridU+2019s popularity, he could still get the position if he so wanted. This book, I tell you, is complete BULLSHIT. (hide spoiler)] Kiera, if youU+2019re reading this or if this somehow gets to you, please understand that IU+2019m not against your decisions. However, I AM mad that things were too abrupt, had no buildups, and seemed to have little to no thought put into it. It obvious; this book didnU+2019t even reach 300 pages. Everything was sloppy, even the writing style. IU+2019ve read better self-published novels than this.This is a very, VERY harsh review, I know, but I loved the Selection series because of how emotional everything was and because I was able to sympathize with the characters. I didnU+2019t love this series because of sloppiness or laziness from the authorU+2019s part. I know that Eadlyn isnU+2019t supposed to be a very emotional person, but everyone U+2013 and I do mean EVERYONE, no matter how cold and stoic they appear in everyday life U+2013 does not stay that way when presented with emotional situations. Especially people who are self-centered, which Eadlyn proclaims to be. Self-centered people are concerned with everything about them including their feelings, ESPECIALLY THEIR FEELINGS, no matter how calculating they may seem. But no, Eadlyn was portrayed as someone who wanted to be the best monarch for her people and was despised despite her efforts. This is not being self-centered. This is attempting to make your character do things that your fans would want her to do. This is making your character make choices that she isnU+2019t prepared to do yet in that part of the book. This is BASTARDIZING your story by forcing it to end by page 278.I wonU+2019t even end this review with a proper conclusion. We didnU+2019t get one, why should this?[The Marid plotline was so obvious that I canU+2019t believe Eadlyn missed it. And she only started to take notice of it when she was drunk!

It just plowed straight through in a bland line to the end. Everyone's character was reduced to some empty shell with dialogue... I can't even properly rage about how infuriatingly DULL this whole thing was because I'm still so bored.There was a partial focus on her mother's health issues, half of a focus on Eadyln coming to terms with ruling the country, and then sometimes she'd randomly remember that whole Selection thing. Everything felt like a side show, especially the typical background chatter of political unrest that this series fails so well at. These books are fun fluffy reads, but the embarrassing attempts at political analysis completely destroy them. My biggest issue with all of the books I've read by Kiera Cass is that events seem to happen because the author just wants them to. The whole book read like watching a middle school play... like all of the characters are forced to say these lines without actually feeling anything or having any realistic reactions and then they rush haphazardly onto the next scene. One second Eadlyn's barely talking to a guy and the next second they're crying about how they're soulmates and getting married?? I do not care. I feel nothing except regret for the past 2 hours I spent reading this mess.Nice things I have to say: middle schoolers would probably really enjoy this book (even the adults in it acted like tweens at times).

En La Corona vemos a una Eadlyn muchU+00EDsimo mU+00E1s madura y consciente de lo que se estU+00E1 jugando con la SelecciU+00F3n; una Eadlyn que entiende mU+00E1s a fondo que debe velar por los intereses de su familia y de su pueblo, sin olvidarse de ella misma. Casi puedo decir que me leU+00ED La Corona de un tirU+00F3n, pues necesitaba saber cU+00F3mo iba a sortear Eadlyn a la opiniU+00F3n pU+00FAblica, las trampas de Marid IllU+00E9a y los entresijos de su propio corazU+00F3n. Cada pU+00E1gina que pasaba, sentU+00EDa yo misma las dudas que Eadly tenU+00EDa, sus miedos y la angustia por su madre y su futuro. VeU+00EDa cU+00F3mo ese sentimiento oculto que habU+00EDa intentado reprimir iba saliendo cada vez mU+00E1s y mU+00E1s a la superficie. U+00A1Ahhhhh! Y es que aunque yo no estuviera muy de acuerdo con ese sentimiento, la intensidad con que se narraban todos los momentos me fue absorbiendo hasta que terminU+00E9 fangirleando con cada palabra que cruzaban (#IsaHablandoEnClaveParaNoDarSpoilers). Lo U+00FAnico que me resta decir antes de entrar a la secciU+00F3n de spoilers es que estoy muy satisfecha con el final que se le ha dado a la historia de Eadlyn y su SelecciU+00F3n. Es un final poco predecible, muy emotivo y que te dejarU+00E1 satisfecho, pero, paradU+00F3jicamente, con ganas de mU+00E1s (querida Kiera, otro libro de relatos cortos, por favor, love you). Y no digo que te deje con ganas de mU+00E1s porque quede incompleto, sino que sencillamente vas a querer saber cU+00F3mo sigue la vida de Maxon, America, Eadlyn y su futuro esposo.Ahora... Los SPOILERSU+00A1EstU+00E1s avisado!No leas mU+00E1s si no quieres saber detalles puntuales. Te lo estoy advirtiendo. Sigue leyendo bajo tu propio riesgo. U+00BFEres masoquista o ya leU+00EDste el libro?Venga, va, U+00FAltimo aviso. Spoilers en 3...2...1...U+00A1Empezamos!U+00B0 Tuve un serio dilema con este par de libros. Desde un primer momento, me encantaba Kile como opciU+00F3n para Eadlyn. De hecho, los shippeaba muchU+00EDsimo. TenU+00EDan una quU+00EDmica increU+00EDble, se conocU+00EDan y lo pasaban fenomenal. Sin embargo, creo que mi corazU+00F3n sabU+00EDa, en el fondo, que Eadlyn no podU+00EDa escogerlo a U+00E9l... a pesar de que ese fue su plan en un momento. Cuando llegU+00F3 la hora de pedirle que se casara con ella, sabU+00EDa que Eadlyn no serU+00EDa capaz de mantener a Kile atado al palacio sabiendo que lo que mU+00E1s deseaba U+00E9l era salir a conocer el mundo y construir cosas. ESA escena me destruyU+00F3 por dentro porque fue terriblemente desgarradora, pero a la vez mostrU+00F3 la faceta mU+00E1s desinteresada de Eadlyn y, bueno, morU+00ED con eso. U+00B0 Hablemos del asunto de Hale e Ean. U+00A1Ay, dioses! Yo me esperaba que Hale fuera gay, a decir verdad, pero lo de Ean se me escapaba, asU+00ED que fue una gran sorpresa leer el momento en el que todo sale a la luz. La verdad es que fue precioso y adorU+00E9 la reacciU+00F3n de Eadlyn que, aunque en un principio fue en plan \"U+00BFquU+00E9 va a pensar la gente de mU+00ED cuando se enteren de que dos Seleccionados se enamoraron entre ellos y no de mU+00ED?\", luego se tornU+00F3 en algo muy tierno. El asegurarse de que los dos tuvieran un futuro lejos del miedo, la recriminaciU+00F3n y el quU+00E9 dirU+00E1n... eso derritiU+00F3 mi corazU+00F3n. U+00B0 Momentazo U+00E9pico aquel en el que Eadlyn le pide a Hale que diseU+00F1e su vestido de boda. HELL YEAH!U+00B0 A pesar de todo el drama, nunca creU+00ED que America fuera a morir. A decir verdad, como que no estaba muy apegada emocionalmente a America y Maxon en su versiU+00F3n de La Heredera y La Corona. SU+00E9 que son los mismos, sU+00F3lo que con 20 aU+00F1os mU+00E1s, pero no lo sentU+00EDa asU+00ED. U+00B0 Peeeeeeeeeeero, hablando de Maxon, lo que sU+00ED me pareciU+00F3 buenU+00EDsimo fue cuando Eadlyn, minutos antes del Report en vivo en el que anunciarU+00E1 al ganador de la SelecciU+00F3n, va a donde su padre a pedirle consejo y U+00E9l le dice \"sU+00E1ltate esa estU+00FApida norma, Eadlyn. CU+00E1sate con el chico del que estU+00E9s enamorada. Si crees que serU+00E1 un marido perfecto, te apoyarU+00E9 hasta el final. Y si la gente no lo aprueba, pues serU+00E1 problema suyo\".U+00B0 Me mataba de ternura ver a Henri intentando aprender inglU+00E9s para poder comunicarse mejor con Eadlyn, aunque creo que en el fondo U+00E9l sabU+00EDa desde hacU+00EDa mucho tiempo de los sentimientos de Erik y Eadlyn. U+00B0 PODEMOS HABLAR POR FAVOR DEL PRIMER BESO DE EADLYN CON EIKKO. AY, MADRE. \"U+00BFSientes algo por mU+00ED? Si has sentido aunque sea una milU+00E9sima parte de lo que yo siento por ti necesito saberlo porque me estoy volviendo loca\".Y LUEGO SE BESAN... Y LUEGO SE DAN CUENTA DE QUE NUNCA VAN A PODER ESTAR JUNTOS. \"Esta serU+00E1 la primera vez en mi vida que no consigo lo que de verdad quiero. Y eres tU+00FA. La vida es cruel\".Y MI CORAZU+00D3N SE ROMPIU+00D3. Y quiero que sepan que yo no querU+00EDa que ellos dos terminaran juntos, yo era muy #TeamKile... pero la intensidad de las situaciones y la lU+00F3gica de no-puedo-ser-egoU+00EDsta-con-Kile terminU+00F3 haciendo que yo amara irreversiblemente a Eikko y Eadlyn como pareja. Creo que el que fuera algo prohibido y aparentemente inalcanzable me llevU+00F3 a adorarlos incluso mU+00E1s. U+00B0 QuizU+00E1 uno de los momentos que me hizo llorar de asdfghjkl fue cuando Eadlyn le pide a Henri que se case con ella. La felicidad de ese hombre me partiU+00F3 el corazU+00F3n por las circunstancias. Sin embargo, justo antes del Report en vivo, Henri lleva a Eadlyn de la mano hasta donde estU+00E1 Eikko y les da su bendiciU+00F3n y es como OH. MY. GOD. YOU'RE. THE. FREAKING. BEST. HENRI. \"-Soy lento con este-, dijo Henri, seU+00F1alU+00E1ndose la boca-. Pero no con este- aU+00F1adiU+00F3, y se seU+00F1alU+00F3 los ojos. -Ustedes son enamorados-prosiguiU+00F3. Eikko negU+00F3 con la cabeza. Henri soltU+00F3 un suspiro y, con cierta desesperaciU+00F3n, lo obligU+00F3 a mostrar la mano derecha, donde destacaba el anillo de sello que yo le habU+00EDa regalado. Y despuU+00E9s me cogiU+00F3 la mano y seU+00F1alU+00F3 el anillo de Eikko\".U+00B0 En resumen, el libro me produjo DEMASIADOS FEELS de los buenos y que me hacen querer releer un libro en el mismo instante en que lo termino.

Except this time the girl chooses from a group of boys.  The girl, Eadlyn, is of course the daughter of America and MaxonU+2014the subjects of the first three books.The Crown (Book #5) picks up where The Heir ends: right after we find out America has had a shocking heart attack and then follows Eadlyn to the end of The Selection.Yes, the whole premise of this series is totally corny and there isn't anything spectacular about the actual writing itself, but it's so adorable and addictive. It's kind of like watching bad reality TV, you know it's bad, but you keep looking for more because you enjoy it on some strange level.Overall, I did find it a great conclusion to the series. It was definitely predictable, but I think if Kiera Cass ended it any other way it wouldn't have worked, and I would have walked away feeling like all the time I put into reading this series was a waste.All of the books in the series are quick reads, but I found I got through The Crown much faster than the others.  It was very short: 278 pages. To put that into perspective, the four other books are all more than 300 pages.  Since this was the last book and it was so short, it felt rushed.I like who she ends up with but I wish we had more build up and a longer look at the relationships between all of the guys who were left in The Crown.  Again, I feel this final book was far too short for a series closer. I wanted more side plots, more tension, more of a conclusion.Yes, these five books have been drawn out when it really could have been just three, but I don't care. I want more.I want to experience another Selection.Thanks so much to HarperCollins UK Children's for approving me for a copy on Netgalley!Pick up your own copy (Amazon US / Amazon CA / Indigo / Book Depository)!"},

Grant it, I only have read The Selection and will only read The Elite if I get it for free or from the library, but the romance in that book was ridiculous with man-cessories and forbidden romance. And that summary...well, cue the ominous music.Merged review:Which of the following is likelyA) America decides that Maxon isn't good in bed and wants Aspen.B) Maxon ends up being the illegitimate heir to the throne and he and America end up being a negative in this makes no sense cast system that they're slowly eliminating. C) An actual plotD) Cass pulls a Princess Diaries 2 and just has the book full of pretty dresses, hijinks full of palace life, and mattress surfing.Yeah, probably D.I can't deal, guys. I don't even know how she managed to sell this one. There's just NO plot there.Edit: Before you say anything, I'm well aware that the series is a continuation of America's daughter. Which should be a spinoff NOT a continuation of series, fyi. When I originally wrote this review there was no synopsis. Therefore, I have no intention of changing it."},

It's crap, but highly entertaining crap.The Crown was no exception. This novel could've been named \"The wonderful and great character traits of Eadlyn Schreave\". The plot is basically Eadlyn doubting herself, followed by someone telling her how strong she is. Then she doubts herself and someone tells her how strong she is. And, take a guess, then she doubts herself and, yes!, someone tells her how strong she is. I'm not kidding.Apart from that this book had a high level of cheesiness. Which was no big deal, since that's what I was used to from the other books in the series.I'm glad I can take those books from my to-read list and never bother myself with them again."},

Events at the palace has forced Eadlyn to step into the spotlight and the further she goes, the more being alone no longer appeals to her. Now she must make the most difficult and important choice she will ever make or expected in her life. The Crown is full of drama, surprises, twists and a perfect ending to an enchanting series.After AmericaU+2019s heart attack, Maxon has appointed Eadlyn to be regent and has narrowed down her suitors to her elite leaving her more stressed than normal. As she continues to send time with the boys, Eadlyn continues to struggle of who she would choose to be her prince. She is surprised by how each of the elite such as Kile, Henri and Hale are close to her heart. Eadlyn continues to find ways to increase her popularity with the people of Illea and ease the growing riots with the help of Marid, the son of August Illea. Now the selection becomes even more important as she finds that being alone no longer appeals to her but also finds herself that her heart may belong to someone that she never thought it would. EadlynU+2019s life turns upside down again when  Maxon passes the crown on to her  and she takes on more roles than she thought possible. Not long after, Marid reveals his true motives that not only threaten EadlynU+2019s image to the people and the selection but the throne as well. In order to stop MaridU+2019s plans, Eadlyn is forced to narrow down her suitors sooner than expected and must choose a husband. However, every decision she makes becomes harder and harder as EadlynU+2019s selection comes to an end when her heart have other desires. As her selection comes to its end, Eadlyn surprises herself and everyone when she makes her the most important decision of her life.Eadlyn has changed a bit since before. SheU+2019s still completely aware of her role but also aware of what others think of her and tries to adjust while maintaining who she is. Kile is still cool. I really like Henri. HeU+2019s so sweet but the language barrier would be too much for me to handle. I love Erik. A big surprise was Josie who finally gets a dose of reality and understands EadlynU+2019s life and the life of a royal. She is likable towards the end. Marid Illea, while at first I thought he was likable until his true colors were revealed and I quickly grew to hate him. Maxon, America, Marlee, Aspen and a few others were great. Lady Brice, I really, really like her. Overall, The Crown was amazing. I really liked it. ItU+2019s a great ending to the series. Not one I expected but a good one none the less. I love how EadlynU+2019s character changes to a very likable person. Her choice for her prince was a surprise but in a way I accept it. We learn a few secrets in The Crown such as who put KileU+2019s name in the selection and some secrets that we didnU+2019t know from the first selection series.

In the fourth book of the series time jumps ahead to where America and Maxon had become king and queen and now have children of their own. Eadlyn is their oldest daughter and now in line to take the crown herself and with unrest in the country it's decided for Eadlyn to have her own selection in order to find herself a husband to become prince. Now in The Crown Eadlyn has narrowed her choices down to the final six and must figure out where her heart lies along with learning to lead a nation. I started off this series on shaky footing only just finding it interesting despite the lack of world building and seeming that the series takes heavily from a couple of other popular things. First it reminded me heavily of The Bachelor television show and then the world in which it was taking place seemed an awfully lot like the Hunger Games world. But after reading the first book I found myself curious as to how and where the story would head and by the end of the first three I really found myself enjoying the story. When picking up the Heir I was by then a bit worried after reading a lot of negative reviews but I found that the new MC Eadlyn seemed to be written just the way I imagined she should be from the way she had been raised and I really enjoyed getting to know her and finding what had happened in the twenty years from the end of the first three books. Now that we are finishing up this series I had hopes of how it would turn out and who Eadlyn would end up with and to my surprise the series ended much the way I hoped but also worked out quite wonderfully some of the ongoing issues throughout. I found this a wonderful finish to what started off as a so-so series for me but quickly peaked my interest. Overall, this whole series has it's flaws throughout but turned into a fun read that I really enjoyed and glad that I gave a chance.

This book really ties up all the loose ends from The Heir extremely well in 279 pages.Eadlyn is so different from her appearance in The Heir. In her first story, Eadlyn is shown to be quite snobby, which definitely turned some people off. However, in The Crown, she starts to realize what people think of her and becomes a better person.

I feel like it becomes even more emphasized in The Crown after America has a heart attack and EadlynU+2019s brother gets married and moves to France. The royal family has even more reason to be together and support each other. The fact that they prioritized each other was really sweet and I found myself smiling at their closeness.The Crown is a much more enjoyable book than The Heir since Eadlyn transforms from her original snobby personality and there is a big theme of family.

I bought it as soon as it was released and took it on a Caribbean cruise as reading material, but was totally and completely let down by it. I hated Eadlyn and I didn't understand the need for her story in the first place. Maybe you're wondering why I even bothered to review this book if I hated book four so much. In the past I have even discussed why I hate when people review books they don't expect to enjoy. But here's the thing: I wanted this final book to redeem the previous one. I wanted Kiera Cass to change my mind about Eadlyn and blow me away with the last bit of her story, but that did not happen here. In fact, I finally gave up at 50% of the way through.The Crown picks up immediately after The Heir left off, with America in the hospital and Eadlyn trying to hold everything else together (for some reason). She has let go of several of the boys, directly mirroring the original trilogy, and is insistent upon choosing one of the remaining boys to marry. I will go ahead and tell you there is nothing about this book that I found redeeming (which is obviously why I decided not to continue reading it) so I'm not going to try to sugar coat this review. I actually had a long list of quotes and notes, but I accidentally deleted it, so whoops. I'm just going to wing it!As with The Heir, there is absolutely no world building to speak of in this book. None. All of the characters remained within the castle walls at all times and honestly I didn't even feel like I could picture any of the rooms in the castle, which is really saying something. I should be able to picture every single nook and cranny of that castle if it's the only location I've seen for two books. Even worse than the lack of a proper world, though, is that these two books are really completely uneccessary. They are literally just The Selection series but with some details tweaked - right down to Eadlyn choosing an Elite to speed things along.But my absolute biggest issue with these two books remains Eadlyn herself. I couldn't stand her. After The Heir, a lot of people wanted to talk about how Eadlyn had changed, had grown up, become selfless. I don't know what book they were reading, but I must have gotten a defective copy. My Eadlyn was a selfish bitch, at least through the 50% of the book that I made it through. And the thing about it is, I'm not the only one that hates Eadlyn - her entire country hates her too. She cannot figure out why everyone hates her. Part of the problem is that every single person surrounding her is constantly telling her how perfect and amazing and gorgeous and powerful she is. Maybe if someone would knock her down off her high horse, she might actually get a clue.Other random things that irritated me about The Crown:- Why is the cover model's dress so big? She's swimming in it. Could they not afford a tailor? In a series that is known for its gorgeous covers, I was really surprised by this. - Am I to believe that the QUEEN cannot recover from a heart attack (which she had at age 30-something, by the way) in her own rooms? They couldn't roll all their equipment down the hall so she could be comfortable? So the KING could be comfortable instead of sleeping in a chair? - Similarly, the princess/regent doesn't have a nighttime maid who could go get her some coffee? The regent of a country has to go down to the kitchen and make her own coffee?? And I mean, I get it if she wanted to get her own coffee, but she specifically says there's no one who can get it for her because it's nighttime. Give me a freaking break. - Am I the only one who thought Kiera Cass made Henri seem like a total moron? I get it. The kid is from another country and doesn't speak English. (Honestly, it's a little unbelievable that someone who was entering this kind of competition wouldn't speak English to begin with, but whatever.) I pictured him as an idiot because that's how he was written. Not speaking a foreign language doesn't make a person dumb. :/ - Since when can a king just decide to stop being king and hand things over to his kid because he's tired of the job? Isn't Queen Elizabeth like, 90 or something now? Why doesn't she just retire and hand things over to Prince Charles? - The ending. Yes, I asked my friend to spoil it for me and just... what? This seems like a decision that was made solely for shock value. Did Kiera Cass decide this person would win while she was writing this book? Because nothing in The Heir pointed to this. In case there was still any doubt in your mind, I hated this book. I hoped for redemption from the final book in this never ending series, but I didn't get it. I don't know what happened to Kiera Cass after The One was written. A friend suggested that perhaps she had been kidnapped and someone was writing in her name. That's the only thing that makes sense, really. Do I still recommend The Selection series? Yes, but stop at book three. "},

Much more than interactions with the boys though it should have been the focal point of the story but... maybe I'm picky.So, because I had great expectations, especially after the author wrote a best selling series I loved very much, I'm feeling let down. It seems rehashed.

The Crown traces the journey of America's daughter, Eadlyn, stepping up to be the queen followed by America's illness. And as The Selection  has been eliminated from their kingdom, Eadlyn still somehow has to choose a suitor for her marriage. Synopsis: When Eadlyn became the first princess of IllU+00E9a to hold her own Selection, she didnU+2019t think she would fall in love with any of her thirty-five suitors. She spent the first few weeks of the competition counting down the days until she could send them all home. But as events at the palace force Eadlyn even further into the spotlight, she realizes that she might not be content remaining alone.Eadlyn still isnU+2019t sure sheU+2019ll find the fairy tale ending her parents did twenty years ago. But sometimes the heart has a way of surprising youU+2026and soon Eadlyn must make a choice that feels more impossibleU+2014and more importantU+2014than she ever imagined.Prince Maxon steps down as the king of IllU+00E9a due to his wife, America's illness and as he needs to take care of his loving wife, he cannot burden himself with the kingdom duties. And it is time for the youngest lady of IllU+00E9a to be the queen, yes, you heard it right, Eadlyn soon transforms herself from an arrogant little girl to someone responsible and mature within a fortnight and this is where the readers are going to fall for her. But she also has to choose a suitor from 35 male candidates and among them only 6 remained and whom she actually fancied. Who will win Eadlyn's heart among the six suitors?BORING ALERT!Well I remember rating the previous book with 4 stars only because of the author's writing style, and other techniques and I clearly remember how much Eadlyn sucked all through out the book! In this book, I was looking and hoping for a bit of Eadlyn's evolving characterization, yes Cass did involve a lot of changes in Eadlyn's portrayal, instead all those happened rather abruptly, without any reason or within an eventual build up! After reading this book, I believe, I shouldn't have given 4 stars to the previous book...There is literally no romance at all in this book, so if you're looking for some cheesy, moving drama, then look elsewhere, as Eadlyn displayed zero feelings or interest towards any of the 6 suitors, not even with the guy whom she ended up with. Yes, there are quite a lot of romantic scenes involving our very own America and Maxon, and those are depicted with a lot of feels and evocative emotions. Even the guy whom Eadlyn ended up is terribly wrong as it does not sync with the demeanor and the qualities reflected by the other suitors. The writing style is not at all articulate, things have not been formed with a proper flow, as the events and the twists unraveled rather hastily, without any proper explanation. The prose is not good, the pacing is way too fast, and felt like riding a super fast train and missing out most of the scenery from its window. The narrative is tad boring and has nothing to hold on to. The whole story building has shortcomings and it will be real difficult for the readers who have lost touch with the previous stories. The vividity and depth is missing from the prose, thus making it quite uninteresting and I found myself hurriedly skimming through the pages of this book.The newly introduced characters lacked depth and development hence it becomes difficult for the readers top connect with them. The characters of Maxon and America needed no development, although their presence made the story a bit uplifting enough to keep reading. On the other hand, their precious daughter, Eadlyn, sucked from the heart to the mind and especially she sucked heavily when she went to those boring dates with each of her suitors. Even the supporting characters are not that well-developed. Yet again, the book' cover left me awe-struck and kept me arrested for a while with all those litters and the grace captured possibly by Eadlyn is something amazing. Overall, I would recommend that it will be best if you can skip this book, as there is not much mention of America or Maxon, mostly the story revolves around Eadlyn.Verdict:  Not that much of a promising end!

As much as I loved the previous three books about EadlynU+2019s parents, there was something lacking in EadlynU+2019s story. Romance was what was lacking. However, I needed to know who Edalyn picked (or if she even picks someone).The first 50% of The Crown was boring. Although Eadlyn stopped whining and seems to take on more responsibility, I found myself getting tired of her inner monologue and side stories. I wanted more interaction between Eadyln and the guys in the selection.What I got? Eadlyn being concerned about making the people happy, her concerned about her mother, her concerned about her brother, just basically Eadlyn concerned about everything, except finding a man to marry and love. Okay, maybe she was stressed about finding a man, but she didnU+2019t seem to make any more connections that what she made in The Heir.Give me romance PLEASE!The second 50% I got a little bit of what I asked for. I saw Eadlyn developing and changing. She was becoming more mature, more focused and I felt like she was connecting more with the men. There are a lot of guys and I had a feeling it would go down to three of them.Would she go with Kile, her long time best friend, who lives in the palace? Who would always make her laugh and be a familiar face?Would she go with Erik, HenriU+2019s translator, who gives Eadyln special sweet moments?Would she go with Henri, the adorable man, who canU+2019t speak English but worships the ground Eadyln walks on.As stated in my previous review in The Heir I loved Erik. I found him the best of both worlds. HeU+2019s the underdog, heU+2019s completely sweet and I love how heU+2019s not part of the selection. I also love that he will put honor and duty before selfish actions.My second favorite is a tie between Kile and Henri. I found Kile the front runner in the beginning in The Heir, but as EadlynU+2019s relationship with him progressed, it seemed they were forcing a relationship between them because it was the best option. It feel seem neither organic nor natural.I loved Henri because his only flaw was that he couldnU+2019t speak English. HeU+2019s funny and over the top sweet. He probably would have been my favorite except for his one flaw.Who will she choose? Who knows? And does she even choose anyone to begin with? Well thatU+2019s a question I had throughout the book.The Crown keeps you on your toes and you NEVER know whatU+2019s going to happen. I did the audio version of the book because I enjoyed the narrator so much from The Heir. The girl can cry, convey emotions like no oneU+2019s business. I am a complete fan. Overall, I found EadlynU+2019s story mild and kind of meh. I think if the author made this more romance base it would have been a winner for me. "},

I didn't really plan on reading The Crown but I picked it up one night and, by some miracle, I read it in one sitting. I was still bitter from The Heir when I started The Crown but I don't know if it's because I was in the right mood for reading this book or what but it slowly started to grow on me. Around 200 pages in, I tentatively acknowledged that I kind of didn't hate this book. Overall, I'm surprised that I didn't hate this book. The Crown is, in my opinion, a massive improvement from The Heir. I still don't like it as much as the original Selection but I enjoyed The Crown. I wasn't really expecting how it ended but I liked how it ended. And I think the series ended on a pretty good note. If you hate The Heir with a burning passion like I do, I wouldn't necessarily recommend The Crown but I don't think it's a complete waste of time."},

Eadlyn wasn't as terrible this time around. I applaud you.\"You are always just Eadlyn. And you are always the queen. You are everything to everyone. And infinitely more to me.\" Plot:Eadlyn Schreave is still making her way through her Selection.With the recent tragedies of her brother's flee and her mother's health, Eadlyn is forced to cut the group down to the Elite.Only Gunner, Hale, Ean, Fox, Kile, and Henri remain. Along with Henri, Erik is still in the castle.As the Selection continues and threats fall upon the princess, Eadlyn must make choices that will effect the fairytale she never knew she would seek out. The Elite are hanging by wires, and they are being eliminated very quickly. Eadlyn can feel herself falling for someone, but they may not be who she should be falling for.Further threats cause Eadlyn to have to rush her decision.Who will she choose to rule beside her? What kind of queen will she be? Who can she trust? Who does she love? And are they the right person?Characters:Eadlyn Schreave:Don't get me wrong, I still hate her. I really do. I think she's selfish and a brat and too big for her britches.That being said, by the end of this book, I was glad she got her happy ending.I think some of the events that happened in this boom especially really humbled her and made her realize that no, she in fact is not the only person in the world. Her family is there, too. Her friends. Her loves.In The Crown, Kiera really pushed Eadlyn to be a better person and also to pursue true love. Through this, Eadlyn came to the conclusion that it is acceptable to need someone. It's okay to let other people take care of you sometimes. It's okay to be in love - even if it's with someone you don't want to love.Love. Like clothes, I had guessed it was something that fit no two people exactly the same way. I was still unsure what the word looked like for me, but I sensed that, sooner rather than later, it would be fully defined. All that remained to be seen was if I could be satisfied with the definition.Kile Woodwork:You guys know I love him. I love that he knows that there is a life outside of the castle, outside of IllU+00E9a. I love that he loves architecture and life and Eadlyn and his sister and his parents and everyone he grew up with. I love that he wants to leave the castle but also is willing to give that up for Eadlyn. I love that he is friends with the other Selected and that he wears ties that prevent world peace.

I didn't know it the whole time.Henri Jakoppi:You're sweet, man. You really are. And I loved your poem for Eadlyn, but you can't speak English. I just don't know how we're gonna work this out.Erik Koskinen:I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU THE WHOLE TIME. WITH YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL BODY, YOU BEAUTIFUL PERSON.Why must you make love impossible, Kiera?Even Erik had gotten me a flower. I smirked a bit as I took it.\"This is a dandelion,\" I told him.He shrugged. \"I know. Some see a weed; some see a flower.

I want to know about Eadlyn's babies and her wedding and her life with you-know-who (no, not Voldemort) and her reign as queen. I want to know about her kids' lives and their kids' lives and every kids' lives.The struggles of reading.*sigh*Please write another book, Kiera. I'll buy you a bow for your hair. I promise."},

This one was flat and lackluster.5. There was no real solution to any of the political and caste issues. Overall I hate to say it, but this feels like a book that was written for the love of money instead of for love of the story. It comes across as if the author herself is just OVER this damn series already. The Heir and The Crown should have never been published. Eadlyn's story is pointless and there is no resolution to anything! #ForTheLoveOfMoney #MyPublisherMadeMeDoItI recommend only reading the first three Selection books. Those are great if you want some fluffy and fun books. If you've already read The Heir and are curious about this one, then I say go ahead and give this one a go. Might as well because it's extremely short. I read it in one sitting, that's how short it is. Definitely borrow the book from the library or a friend though.#AtLeastItsAShortFailure"},

I wish we'd seen similar challenges that the boys in Eadlyn's Selection had to face, because it felt downright easy for them. I appreciated Cass not going the traditional route in quite a few instances, especially since Eadlyn's circumstances are so different from America and Maxon's. That said, this whole last book felt rushed, from the feelings to the political developments. I really could have used more time to see the characters interact. Overall, a fun, fast read that really deserves a second epilogue. But maybe that will come? "},

But he knew how to handle himself and his relationship with America. Eadlyn says she was in love with this man while she was running around staring at other guy's faces and holding their hands. She legit has more scenes with the others than the guy she ends up with. And then she has the nerve to say Fox couldn't love her because they didn't spend that much time together when it is legit the same for the guy she chose...I felt like she was trying to tell us the romance was soo tragic because he wasn't chosen and honestly, the only thing tragic and relatable to Romeo and Juliet this situation is how they were acting. Like teenagers who somehow loved each other because of their attraction. Jfc. She asks him what his name is like three days before she proposes. Are you joking. Maxon and America had months of buildup, three books worthy of adventures and sneaking off and everything they did together. Let me remind you 80% of the time she was with ****, she was with *****, too. I can't. I can't. I'm sorry. P.S. Kile deserves better. Every scene with him and Eadlyn did not feel like Kiera Cass was shouting at us how in love they were.

But there is a minimum to be reached if you ask me, and while it was thankfully scraping it for the most part, sometimes I just facepalmed myself.Moving on. I went in wanting to rate this very loosely because I didnU+2019t expect it sweep me off my feet, I just wanted a cute fairytale ending -like in The One, and even that didnU+2019t happen. The ending felt sloppy and rushed and didnU+2019t answer all the questions EadlynU+2019s books raised. Romantically speaking, the ending was a good one, she ended up with the guy I was rooting for so I was happy with that. But politics wise, the One ended with everything being in order, first The Heir messes everything up, then this one starts fixing things -we admittedly see the light at the end of the tunnel- but it is just not enough. I wanted to see what the peopleU+2019s reaction will be to the announcements she made.I didnU+2019t review the Heir when I read it because I wasnU+2019t blogging yet but I mentioned it in my very first wrap-up and said that I didnU+2019t like Eadlyn, not one bit. I actually hated her. But now she changed. For the better that is. She stopped being whiny, selfish and arrogant, sheU+2019s now strong and responsible willing to do anything for her family and country, and I really appreciated that change but the one thing that I wanted to slap her for is how trusting she became. She went from 0 to 100 reaaal quick and I was sure it was going to come back and bite her in the ass. Which eventually happened.As for the guys, I felt like the characters fell flat and were very one dimensional aside from Kile, Erik and maybe Hale who were okay. I understand that with 30 guys it is impossible to develop all of them, but with the final 5, I wouldU+2019ve like a little more depth even they ultimately werenU+2019t going to stick around, it wouldU+2019ve made her choice less obvious. I must admit that in the original trilogy, the girls were better thought out than the boys in these two final books."},

It was everything The Heir wasn't and more. I'm just a huge fan of this series and I've always gone into these books with no expectations because they are pure entertainment for me. The ending to this series did not disappoint me though.Eadlyn has completely grown up and matured since America's health scare. Was anyone else happy that America got through that nasty heart attack? I was so nervous after The Heir's ending! I almost wished Kiera Cass had stopped writing these books if she just planned to have something so horrible happen to America. . but I'm glad nothing did.Now that Eadlyn has been named regent while Maxon stays by America's side as she recovers (seriously so sweet !!), she's ready to take care of business. Her first task is to slim down her suitors to the Elite, and I was actually relieved that she did. I wanted to get to know the boys I actually liked a little better. I was happy to see she kept both Kile and Henri (only because Erik was his translator), and maybe a little happy she kept Hale also!As soon as that is taken care of, it was nice to see how Eadlyn managed to tackle her new job so great. I really enjoyed seeing more politics throughout the story. I'm glad we got more backstory on what happened when Maxon became king and how the caste system fell. It all blended together well.  \"I was surrounded by examples of how love, real love, could make you less bothered by your circumstances, whether it was facing the greatest disappointment of your life or shouldering the weight of a country.\"All of Eadlyn's dates were adorable, when she did have time for them, and I enjoyed all the romance woven into the story. I was rooting for Kile since The Heir, but once I saw more of Eady and Erik.. Well, I couldn't help but fall in love with them. Erik was just so sweet and loved her for who she was. . . How could I not love that?Like I said, Eadlyn truly grows up in this book. At the end of the last book I actually saw her appreciating the things/people around her more, so her character development didn't surprise me at all. She was lovely even when she did make mistakes because she knew what she did wrong, and she wasn't afraid to admit that. Who she was in this book made me appreciate who she was in the last.  \"I'm telling you, Eady, wars and treaties and even countries will all come and go. But your life is yours, singular and sacred, and you should be with the person who makes it feel that way every blessed second you live it.\"I was happy to see the growth of all of Eadlyn's relationships with everyone in her life, not just her family and the Elite, but her friendships with Neena and even Josie. I think her relationships helped us see how much she has always loved those around her, especially the people of Illea.\"I'm fine.\" She rolled her eyes as they headed off the stage.\"Are you sure? We could have dinner brought up to our room.\"\"So help me, if you do that, I will throw it at you.\"MAXON AND AMERICA! I love them, forever. I just loved how they were finally acting more like themselves in this book. There were definitely more family moments and I loved every minute of them! I was happy to see Ahren come home and apologize, although I wish we saw him apologize to America, but I was just happy to see him again. I loved all the moments between Eadlyn, Osten, and Kaden as well. I'm going to miss them! :(  \"You are everything to everyone. And infinitely more to me.\"The ending was great! Cass's books are always fun, light reads and this one was just as wonderful as the first 3 books in this series. There were swoon-worthy moments, tear-filled moments, and happily ever afters. I'm really happy with who Eadlyn chose to be with and how the future looks bright for the people of Illea.Overall, I really enjoyed this book. I wish we got a little more at the end or even throughout the book. I'm happy it didn't drag out but I still could've used a little more detail. I want to know more about Aspen and Lucy's future, what happened to the Elite after they left the palace, and more about Neena's life now.. I would've loved to see the wedding too! Who doesn't love weddings?!If you're a fan of this series I think you'll be happy and ready to finally say goodbye to this wonderful world Kiera Cass created for us! Ok.. Actually just one more novella and I'll be ready to say goodbye for good. . . :)"},

She breaks down. She is more vulnerable, more compassionate and caring. She find herself having a newfound confidence without being a snob or a brat. I genuinely loved her in this book. I was really rooting for her. I am very happy for her and I am super proud of her growth. The one thing everyone wants to know is who she picked but I'm not going to say who it is. I will say I was very happy with her choice. However, I will say one thing that kind of bothered me a little. I only wish she and her chosen man would have had some more scenes together. I understand she has 7 of the Selected she has to get to know and a country to run but I didn't absolutely feel like their love was completely believable at first. They had fantastic moments but I did need some more time for them to be with each other before I was really caught up in their romance. I am totally satisfied with her choice, don't get me wrong, but it felt a tiny bit rushed at times. However, by the end I could see why they fell in love with each other and I could celebrate with her and her man. In the first book, as Eadlyn didn't really care about the Selection nor was taking it very seriously so we didn't really get to know her suitors. I'm really enjoyed getting to know them all so much more in this one. I can say that all of them are really great, like I seriously could have accepted whomever she chose in the end. The romance, although is the main part of this book, I actually enjoyed seeing Eadlyn with her family and friends. We see America and Maxon being the absolute cutest and most devoted couple ever. We see Aspen and Lucy being strong despite their tragic struggles. Then we have her brothers who love her so much. Lady Brice and Neena as so loyal and hardworking, I just adore them both. She wouldn't have been able to be a queen without these people. Even those in the Selection became her friends and supported her. It was just so wonderful to see her support system go to work. We have a new villain. I won't say who because I don't want to spoil the surprise but the said person can go to hell. Ew. Ugh. I do not like this person. I thought I did but nope. Its all gone now. The person is a serious problem but Eadlyn takes out the trash by the end. There is something that came as a huge surprise for me. I didn't see it coming. It has nothing to do with Eadlyn and everything to do with Maxon and his father. I was shocked and speechless with anger. I can't even think about it too much or I will freak out. Nonetheless I need to get it off my chest so I can move on. (view spoiler)[ We all hate Clarkson, right? He was a cruel father and a questionable husband but the one thing, the one redeeming quality he had was that he cared so much for his wife. He was devoted to her. Or at least that's what I thought until Maxon told Eadlyn about his father's mistress. Yes. Mistress. I couldn't believe it at first but then I remembered that Clarkson was always a greedy, selfish and heartless bastard. HOW COULD HE DO THAT TO AMBERLY??!! She was the MOST devoted wife in the world. She worshipped the ground he walked on and he cheats on her. He did seem to be guilty as see in some of his actions towards to Amberly but then if he felt so guilty why didn't he stop seeing his mistress?! I was so pissed. Then I felt horribly sad for Amberly because if she knew, she would have died from heartbreak. She deserved SO MUCH BETTER. Then we find out Maxon has a half-sister. Thank god she is nothing like her parents and a completely wonderful human being. Rant done.  (hide spoiler)]On a happier note, I am impressed by Eadlyn's growth, I adore seeing old and new characters working together and I love the finale to the Selection series. The book moved so fast for me, especially at the end, not like rushed but so much was happening that I just had to finish it as soon as possible. I cried tears of sadness and tears of joy and I want to thank Kiera Cass for introducing these characters to her readers. Although I have had my moments of anger and frustration for some of the characters' actions (I'm looking at you America), I know I am perfectly happy to have these books on my shelf where I can return to them one day to look at the struggles of finding love but knowing it is all worth it in the end. Note: I really need another epilogue because I need to see more of these characters even for a little bit. [ We all hate Clarkson, right?

Just BOOM! Middle of the chapter.Also I'm just going to put it out there that I was extremely disappointed with the cover. All the other covers were downright mesmerizing!....Then there was The Crown....Why is she staring down the camera?In all the other covers, the model's face was artfully hidden in a way that left a little bit to the imagination and made it a little mysterious. I'd definitely prefer it that way!The model is not ugly in any way. She's actually very pretty, but this cover is rather unflattering and didn't do her justice. Spoilers from here on out!The Lady Brice thing was interesting. I really liked her. I'm actually glad the Cass put that in because it seemed strange that we had never heard of or seen Clarkson in his mighty sh*tiness cheating on his wife.And we all knew there was no way he'd be faithful to Amberly....poor Amberly!Seriously WHAT did she see in Clarkson?I swear she'll like a goddamned Disney Snow White: Oh, he's sooo handsome and he's a royal! He's definitely my true looove!No.Just. No.The romance was so meh and not swoon-worthy.Kiera Cass usually knows how to make me swoon. Maxon is one of my absolute favorite book boyfriends and I always swoon over him!Eikko (Erik) could have been totally swoon-worthy too, but he just wasn't!He was extremely sweet and all, but there was barely enough interaction between him and Eadlyn to serve as a solid foundation for their \"soulmates\" status.And Eadlyn was like I love him, he's my soulmate but there wasn't enough between them for it to even get to that point! And, like, zero chemistry!Like they were mildly friends, then they skipped to soulmates!You can't just have a hamburger with two buns!Where's the meat, bruh? And the lettuce and tomatoes and fromage and mayonnaise??The only thing within this romantic sandwich was one measly slice of ham!(This may or may not be an metaphor of my current state of hunger)Hale and Ean? Really? Interesting twist, I guess.I actually enjoyed Josie in this one! And Grandma Singer is the best!The Marid issue was strange. It felt a tad forced because we didn't haven't any big conflicts, so the author needed to add something. Perhaps it was just a method to justify the extremely quick ending, how Eadlyn's deadline for picking a suitor went from two weeks to two days, thereby cutting off between 50 and 100 pages from the book in which the fixing of the government could have been and should have been explained.As a dystopian book, The Crown definitely should have focused more on the world, not mainly the romance.I honestly would have preferred the book(s) to be in Ahren's perspective because he seemed to have a deeper and more realistic romantic tale to tell. Alas, 'tis not the case."},

In The Heir, we were introduce to a spoiled, selfish and pretentious princess, a daughter of our beloved Maxon and America. To be honest, it didn't bother me that much that she was the way that she was, but sure as hell she wasn't one of my favorite character either. And now that has changed - she is now definitely one of my favorite characters I read about. She has become a selfless, strong young woman, trying to make up for all the stupid mistakes she had made. I loved that the book was concentrated on her pulling down the walls she had pulled up around herself, on her growing as a person. The Selection that she held happened to finish differently from how it was supposed to, and I guess that that was a family trait. When I first found out who was she going to pick, because I had spoiled it to myself obviously, I was not very happy about it. But as I got to know the story, I was happy how it turned out and I grew to love the character she chose. Who am I to be mad about my initial ship not being able to sail?

It was simple and easy, nothing to hard to understand. This book is more clean (romance wise) than her first three books, I would definitely recommend this book to teens from 13 years old and up. I did felt like she rushed us through her story though. The characters were well described in the context of the book; however, the book itself is very short and with a lot of space between chapters--I wish she could've prolonged the story and give us a little bit more of description regarding the characters. I felt like Eadlyn's character in this book is more humble towards everyone, and I really appreciate her change of personality. In \"The Heir\" she was really harsh towards everyone in her court, even her family. But in this one we get to see a change of heart--sort of. I did enjoy seeing how she acted towards the members of the council, she doesn't take BS from anyone, and I think that is a good quality to have when you are becoming queen of a country. But, since everything that happen with her mom, her brother, and well now with the rest of the selection is good to see her more humble towards them, and I believe that her change of heart made her see who was the best choice for her on the selection.Now, her prince consort wasn't a surprise for me. I kind of saw that happening in \"The Heir\" I won't spoil it for you, but her choice is going to blow your mind.Overall, I gave this book a 4/5 stars just because I wish she could've describe better the relationship between the Eadlyn and her prince consort. I felt like she didn't give us enough insight on their relationship--bringing the book to an end way too soon. However, this book is short and simple, nothing overbearing and not too many issues to overcome. I would definitely recommend this series if you haven't read it, it will consume your body, soul and mind.

Like, really? How incredibly base and undignified.With all said and done, though, the best part of this book was Eadlyn. She's a rude-ass beotch with a bug up her ass but she's realistic as hell. I've met people like her in real life. You know those heroines in YA who are just so fucking perfect and universally loved and really just big pieces of cardboard for the heroes to swoon over? That's not Eadlyn. She's an entitled fucking arsehole but she had a really, really strong voice. I loved this about her.I could blah blah blah about America and Maxon but they're my baes, so who cares. You already know that. I was so over everyone else (did you guys think that Marlee was a total fucking train wreck in this book? Like what the shit? Girlfriend needs to simmer the fuck down and stop greeting) but America and Maxon are my sweet summer children.

I was not expecting what happened to Hale and Ean to happen. And that plot twist at the end, I can't believe Maxon has a stepsister and Eadlyn has an aunt from that side of the family. I loved Lady (Aunt) Brice and was thrilled about the ending. I also loved that Josie finally clued into that a princess' life isn't full of parties and ball gowns and a lot of actual work.

Doesn't mean I know how, but every single things they do are beyond common sense.For instance, take a look at what Eadlyn does to Sir Coddly. NOT ONLY HIS NAME IS STUPID AND COMPLETE RUBBISH, I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER SHE MENTIONS WHAT POSITION HE HOLDS. She mentions that, \"He does something with pens and papers.\" UM EXCUSE ME? Anyway, Sir Coddly is her adviser of some sort, and he advises Eadlyn to rage war on France for Ahren's betrayal. She inclines to do so, stating that, \"This is not treason. This is love.\"My ass.YOU JUST COULDN'T SAY THAT TO YOUR ADVISER, YOU WITCH! If you've watched The King's Speech, one of my most memorable line is, \"We are not family. We are firm.\" Spoken by Colin Firth as Duke of York to his currently reigned king father. Your family is a firm if you're born into royalty. And to say that, \"This is not treason. This is LOVE,\" to justify your brother's act of leaving a country behind is not a royal thing to say.And after that, Eadlyn fires Sir Coddly. BECAUSE SHE DISAGREES WITH HIS OPINION. That's. Not. How. You. Fucking. Run. A. Country. You. Dumbass. Imagine if all world-leaders constantly fire someone they don't like for personal reasons. What a more stupid, chaotic world we would live in.The idiocy goes on. Eadlyn offers to ascend because her mother's health is getting worse. Again, it seems like Kiera Cass doesn't know how monarchy works: you have to die before giving your heir your throne. First, the ruler of the country is MAXON, not America, and he's well and very much alive and still young. Second, I CAN'T FUCKING BELIEVE HE LET HIS UNSTABLE 18 YO RUN HIS COUNTRY AT A GREAT TIME OF CRISIS. Maxon, you clearly have no backbone. Gone was every respect I worshipped to you in the first three installments of the series.So, that is the worst. The final stupidity is that Eadlyn finally chooses Erik or Eikko, Henri's translator, and gives her speech and propose. Protests rise among the crowds, and Maxon replies, \"Why are you yelling at me, you fools? She's your queen, for goodness's sake. Ask her.\"Omg.So, in a book where royalty is the subject, we will expect a great deal of politics to be played, right? I assure you, there is none. This is not a fiction about politics. This is a fiction about silly romance and stupid balls and who wears the gaudiest dress.From time to time, we are not shown how Eadlyn runs her country. She spends time battling her eyelashes to the suitors, joking with her brothers, coddling with her parents, complaining about her new maid, worrying what should she say in front of the camera, yadda yadda. I don't even have a fucking idea about what kind of test conducted to the suitors. Surely, if you're picking for a partner to run a country with, there must be some kind of fit and proper test, right? If I were Eadlyn, I would demand them to do some social projects and go on tour to see how the projects are going. BECAUSE THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW YOUR PARTNER IS GOOD FOR YOU TO RUN A COUNTRY WITH: by seeing how much he loves the society and how willing he is to rebuild it, not by seeing how good he is at making you laugh. You should rent a jester instead.My final thought: after spending a faor amount of quality time with Kestrel and Feyre, Eadlyn ruins my reading mood. This book is utter disappointment. Excuse me, I'd better rub my eyes with ice cubes right now."},

But this book, the final one in the series, proved me wrong.I'm really sad about it, because I LOVE the world that Cass has created... The Selection had all of the elements I require to call it a a great series, except one. I just HATE Cass main female characters, they are so annoying and passed as clever when clearly, they are not !The Crown was SO bad ! Where to start ? It reminded me of everything I hated when I read the Selection. With America being a brat that kept changing her mind about who she wanted to end up with, without any valid reason given. Something happens, she misinterprets it. And her feelings do a 180. She's manipulated by everyone. Basically a puppet incapable of thinking and feeling for herself.I actually like Eadlyn in the first novel. I though that she was struggling to find who she was and what kind of ruler she wanted to be, she seemed clever and really invested in her relationship with Kyle. (view spoiler)[So when in a couple of pages, she ended up falling in love with Erik, I was BAFFLED ! There was no real building of the relationship and feelings on her part. I could definitely see where Erik's feelings came from, but Eadlyn's seemed fake. It happened way too fast. And the whole story felt like the author manipulating you into liking the main character. And the ending... so stupid ! I felt like reading H.R.H. by Danielle Steele all over again (which is probably the stupidest novel I've ever read in my entire life!). The idea of a \"constitutional monarchy\" (although VERY GOOD) came out of nowhere. I would have liked to read more (or anything really) about Eadlyn political aspirations and hopes for her country. The novel was quite short, so I felt there was many ways it could have been developed, especially since it's the last of the series....

Cuando lees la secuela de algo, ya sea por recuerdos, diU+00E1logo o la situaciU+00F3n, los protagonistas suelen hacer un poco de recap, pero aquU+00ED el libro continU+00FAa EXACTAMENTE dU+00F3nde lo dejU+00F3, y hacia delante.

SU+00ED, sU+00E9 que habU+00EDa mucha gente en el team del afortunado chaval, pero la forma de llevar el romance en The Crown ha sido demasiado instalove, porque las seU+00F1ales que habU+00EDa en The Heir las habU+00EDa multiplicadas por cuatro con otros candidatos. En mi opiniU+00F3n, la idea original de Kiera Cass era otra, pero a riesgo de hacer la historia demasiado parecida a la trilogU+00EDa original o demasiado predecible, ha optado por sacrificar la quU+00EDmica de la protagonista con otros personajes y optar por el final \"inesperado\", lo cual deja a una bastante frU+00EDa.- Las decisiones polU+00EDticas de este libro carecen de absoluta lU+00F3gica, salvo la final (good move!), y en casos como el de Maxon, estU+00E1n completamente fuera de su personaje.- En el libro, en esencia, no pasa ABSOLUTAMENTE NADA, de hecho, hay mU+00E1s acciU+00F3n en The Heir que aquU+00ED.- Hay personajes que solo son herramientas para la historia, y que se comportan o mueven de formas muy convenientes para el desarrollo de Eadlyn o de la \"\"\"trama\"\"\".- Las cosas que hacen Eadlyn y su elegido no son romU+00E1nticas, son ridU+00EDculas y con un extra de drama que me ataca los nervios.- BONUS: Por U+00FAltimo y no por ello menos importante: la portada de The Crown me sigue pareciendo super siniestra y la peor de las cinco de La SelecciU+00F3n.Es triste, porque de verdad querU+00EDa que me gustase la historia de Eadlyn, y al final se ha quedado en meh. De todas formas, si buscas una lectura ligera y te gustU+00F3 La SelecciU+00F3n, siempre estU+00E1 bien para volver a su universo... pero espera a tener los dos libros y leerlos del tirU+00F3n, porque quiero creer que es la U+00FAnica forma en la que esta continuaciU+00F3n tiene sentido."},

But sometimes the heart has a way of surprising youU+2026and soon Eadlyn must make a choice that feels more impossibleU+2014and more importantU+2014than she ever imagined. Plot:Personally, I LOVED The Heir. However, The Crown fell a bit short on my standards. It felt forced, and the pacing was a bit dreadful, but that's because The Selection for Eadlyn was only 3 months. I was definitely surprised by the turn of events towards the end, and I was certainly not expecting it. I think I'll have a lot of followers on this point; that ending was unexpected, and I'm not very happy with it. It felt out of nowhere and incredibly rushed. Despite all of the complaints I just listed, this book was incredibly fun, and I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Characters:There as definitely a lot of rushed character development in this book. Don't get me wrong, I'm super happy about Eadlyn's turnout. It was a fresh relief to see The Selection from the princess' POV. It was far less intense than the original trilogy, because the suitors aren't fighting like cats and dogs over Eadlyn, and there weren't any intense relationship moments (Well not compared to the first three). Let me just say, THAT ENDING. It was so out of the blue, and I was not hoping for her to end up with ****. One chapter she was in love with someone, and the next, she was in love with another. I DON'T GET IT! It was a bit sloppy on that part. The one thing that bothered me was that Kiera Cass randomly threw in gay characters. Was that really necessary??? There was no need for gay characters, and it was annoying. I will say, however, it was unexpected, and I was unpleasantly surprised. Overall & Recommendations:This was a nice little wrap up to the selection series, but I had my problems with it. The plot was good, but definitely had some minor flaws. The characters had an unexpected turnout, and some I was not so happy with. Kiera Cass is such an amazing author, and I love this series SO MUCH. If you haven't read this series, go ahead and drop whatever you are doing, and pick this up RIGHT NOW. 12+ girls."},

I kept thinking \"ugh, what's the point to even finish reading?\". Honestly, I wouldn't have even been that mad about her choice except it made absolutely no sense at all. There was no chemistry whatsoever between her and the person she ends up choosing. It's very confusing and disappointing, especially considering the very obvious chemistry between her and the person myself, and half the fandom, was rooting for.

It makes zero sense. I laughed when I saw that. And then she banishes Kile for what? Caring too much?! All the events of the previous book were pointing towards Kile and Eadlyn. I don't know what happened. Maybe Cass changed her mind because, why, they seemed too obvious? Too similar to Maxon/America (I don't understand how in that aspect though??) Regardless of predictability, they were the pairing most of us wanted! If she was going for an element of surprise it was horribly executed.

It should've ended after the third book but then again I ended up giving The Heir 5 stars anyway (don't even ask me HOW I could do that; I have no idea!! Need to change that ...) and this one didn't get a bad rating as well. Hmm.I remember I was rooting for my beloved Erik / Eikko because he's just adorable and made the story somewhat more interesting, in my opinion. I just couldn't help but fall in love with him - HE'S SO SWEET AND I LOVE HIM! Kile was my second favorite but I never quite felt the chemistry between Eadlyn and him? Like, no? Okay, I admit, there also wasn't THAT much chemistry between Erik and Eadlyn at first but there were little hints to where this could lead ... it just felt better to me.As of Eadlyn herself, I have to say that she was okay in this book. I absolutely couldn't stand her in the beginning of the first book but thank goodness she changed a bit (as well as in this book) - she's still selfish and mostly thinks about herself first but ... especially towards the end she realized how wrong she was all this time and actually starts to change her behavious and all that. I don't approve of all her decisions and I certainly don't think she's the best character ever but ... I don't know, maybe this book just mushed my brain and I can't think straight anymore.The plot was almost non-existent, which is sad because this series had potential. There were rebel groups and attacks and she could've definitely told us some more about these things, make this a whole lot more interesting ... but she didn't. Instead she focused on Eadlyn and her duty and finding a husband and many other \"unimportant\" things. Seeing it that way is actually disappointing and yet I still enjoyed it most of the times ... oh my, oh my. There was one big plot twist that I absolutely didn't see coming - it would've probably been a really good one but it came out of no where and therefore I was like \"Ummm, okay? REALLY?! NOW?!\", so yeah. Without sounding mean, Kiera definitely has potential but I don't think she quite knows how to use it properly? She could've done so much better.So, am I happy with the ending I got? Let's just say I'm glad Eadlyn chose the right person but she could've done that within one (a bit longer) book as well and we wouldn't have needed to wait so long - it was quite obvious to me, haha. Also, it didn't feel like a conclusion - there are unanswered questions about the kingdom, the people, the rebel groups and all I wanted of Kiera was to give us a GOOD explanation. A good ending ... oh well. I still had lots of fun reading this series and thought the books weren that bad but ... don't write any new books to this series, Kiera.www.aworldbetweenfoldedpages.blogspot.com_______________________June 8th:I'm absolutely NOT sure about my rating and might even change that again but ... well, even though these books aren't that good and kinda cringe-worthy I still enjoy them a lot? They're addictive, a bit silly but easy and fun to read so whatever, haha.Also, I just wanna say that I'm VERY pleased with who Eadlyn ended up with - I KNEW IT RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING, HA!

Some positive things to say about this book is that EadlynU+2019s attitude completely changes from an absolute brat into a person with feelings. I also loved Maxon in this installment because he had some pretty hilarious lines.Some issues I had with this book included not enough pages to flesh everything out. About 130 pages into the story we find out that Maxon is going to step down so he can help America recover so that they can live their life together without all the responsibilities. Okay, what the actual hell. I personally thought Maxon was smarter than that. I donU+2019t think Eadlyn is ready to be a queen after all that has happened in The Heir. Another big issue I had was how she chooses her man. One moment she was set on Kile and then the next moment she banishes him from the land. That to me is such a bitch move, and yet Kile was still fine with it. But what really pisses me off the most was how she was going to marry Henri even though they have no chemistry and that sheU+2019s in love with Erik, his translator. Why ban Kile when youU+2019re going to marry the guy you have nothing in common with. This whole situation left me annoyed and sour with how things went and turned out. Overall the ending was so rushed and the epilogue was stupid and pointless and they could have left that out.Overall I thought this book was a complete let down. There were some positive things, but overall nothing really made sense and was completely rushed. I felt like the last 50 pages were thrown together just to wrap up the series quickly. It was as if Cass gave zero fucks and made the characters do that as well. I decided to rate this book 2/5 stars for those reasons."},

I know some people hate this series and Eadlyn but for me I love this series. It is a fairytale, fantasy to let you escape from reality. It is perfect. Eadlyn for me was such a strong inspiring young female struggling with finding love and leading a country.

But I am not going to do that with this one, because off the many flaws in this story. I loved that the book starts where it left of in  The Heir . Eadlyn is going on with the Selection process and tries to find the most suitable husband. Only six remain and while the uproars in the country grows Eadlyn decides she needs to take over from her dad and become Queen. Eadlyn improved in this book even more. She sees the things from her peopleU+2019s point of view and tries to better everything. She has grown much since the first book. But I do not understand her choices, like the suitor she chooses in the end. I feel for her that her brother left and that her mom is sick and I think she does an amazing job at taking over her dadU+2019s job for a while. Though I think it is a shame we do not see the political point of view. For example Eadlyn talks about being tired for the day because she has done so much, yet the only thing that is written about in the book is that she had a date and signed some contracts. The book felt a little rushed and I couldnU+2019t feel Eadlyn as much as the first book because off the weird time lapses and the holes in the story. Considering the little amount off pages the book has, there could have been so much added, that would make the book feel more real! I felt like the book is to short, the other selection was described in three books and that was hardly enough. And then this selection is only two books  and  the last book has way little pages then the others. I am not pleased that this is the end off a series I loved. Okay back to the Selection process. Like I also mentioned in my other review I still liked seeing the process from the Selector point off view and that the candidates are boys. I do see a lot off differences between the selections. Like in the selection from America I remembered her doing a lot off assignments like hosting a party. I canU+2019t remember a thing that the boys in EadlynU+2019s needed to do. I thought they came off really easy, how can you know who is a suitable king? Another difference between the books is that this book is much girlier, I didnU+2019t particularly like that. Even the covers show that. I think that is also the difference between the main characters. I hoped that because the boys where narrowed down to six in this book, that they would have a bigger role and had a little more dimension... But unfortunately that wasnU+2019t the case. (view spoiler)[ I do not understand why Fox and Gunner where even mentioned in this book being boring as hell. I canU+2019t even remember a thing about them. Eadlyn doesnU+2019t like them but still kept them around for the show. Though I liked the story of Ean and Hale I thought the writer made herself came off easy, two more out off the running who is next..? Then Kile, I was surprised with Eadlyns choice there. I hoped she would choose him over Henry, at least she would be happy with him. But her last minute change was weird. And then Henry how can he become a king when he doesnU+2019t even speak the first language of the country and has no idea off all the traditions or laws!? I do not understand that Eadlyn almost made him king because he is sweet to her. I liked Eric BUT how can he and Eadlyn become so overly in love when they havenU+2019t talked more then three times. INSTA LOVE! Which IU+2019m not a fan off at all! That was also very unrealistic and weird.  (hide spoiler)]Another very unlikely thing was how Maxon resigns. Because he needs some more free time?! A real king wouldnU+2019t do that! That just canU+2019t happen! And also the way Eadlyn takes over from him first is so weird, I get Maxon wants to be with America but you canU+2019t leave your 18! Year old daughter in charge of your whole country while you are wining by her bed. Also, when Eadlyn is queen she needs an advisor and who would you turn toU+2026 Your predecessor and dad. RIGHT? So why the hell is she left alone in this mess and does she needs to do everything by herself. These things make this book so unbelievable. What I missed was excitement and renovation! I think there was missing U+2018a villainU+2019, which where Clarkson, Celeste and the Rebels in the other books. (view spoiler)[ Here it is Marid which I actually didnU+2019t see coming (as one off the only things). But he was weak and when the reader finds out he is bad he actually gets put down immediately. In not a great way. It almost felt a little childish.  (hide spoiler)]Lady Brice secret was one off the things that had a little hint about how good the first books where. It was predictable but that didnU+2019t mean I did not like it. I was upset to see that happen at the very last few pages but it happened. Come to think off it everything happened in the last few pages. Eadlyn decides everything in the end in 10 minutes, just like I feel the writer did. (view spoiler)[ Eric is chosen which, like I said before, I didnU+2019t get. Then she announces that the country will be a constitutional monarchy which I thought was a very clever way to make the people in IllU+00E9a happy but not the Reader of these books. America and Maxon dedicated their whole life to get rid of the castes. Then Eadlyn just gives all the power off being Queen away. I donU+2019t know it didnU+2019t feel right.  (hide spoiler)] And then the epilogueU+2026 really disappointing. I WANT MORE! (Not a book please, maybe a mini epilogue, do they have children, how many!? Will the constitutional monarchy work? Okay we can go on with this family forever. Please let this rest). But I am still disappointed with the epilogue.  The One  was such a great ending to this series while this isU+2026 Just not satisfying! Okay after these many many comments I would still like to say something positive (and explain why I gave it four stars). I loved the writing style and the many beautiful quotes I can get from them. I love all the old characters and I loved to see their families. I liked Eadlyn and the growth she makes. I still love the covers. I just love this world! goodbye Illea! (Hopefully for real now!) I think it's a wise decision to take a break between the third and fourth book, BUT PEOPLE IF YOU LOVED THE FIRST THREE YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THIS TO!! They are a bit less than the other books I thought, but still worth reading even if it is just to see the other characters all grown up.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[ I do not understand why Fox and Gunner where even mentioned in this book being boring as hell.

This is definitely NOT a spoiler-free review so you have been warned! You can find this review on my blog, Israis.First and foremost, Eadlyn had such a personality change from The Heir to The Crown that it gave me whiplash. This spoiled, selfish, brat of a girl all of a sudden becomes a kind of decent person, and while I always appreciate some character development, that was a little too much of a change to happen all of a sudden. The Heir leaves off with her still having such an attitude, although she did change a little bit in the process of book four, but when I picked up The Crown, the first thing I noticed was that she was actually kind of decent? Why? What changed that suddenly made her so willing to be nice and generous and care about her country above all else? That left me frustrated during the beginning, but gradually throughout the book I started ignoring it and focusing on the plot which, trust me, had its fair share of plot holes but we'll get into that later.My main point of reading this book was for the boys, and let me tell you why. While we really don't get to experience much of them because 90% of the story is Eadlyn's internal monologue on what she's possibly going to do to maintain her position of princess without the people rioting (something that she constantly worries about but we never actually see in the book). They all had such potential to be unique and beautiful characters that I wanted to learn more. It's fair to note this first: (view spoiler)[Eadlyn drops the Selection down to a final six Elite in the beginning of the novel (hide spoiler)]. Having said that, let's talk about the boys.Hale is so sweet and kind and he develops so much throughout the book that I would gladly read a spinoff about him and the other remaining Selection candidates. Honestly, he does the bravest thing in the book when he shows Eadlyn his dedication to her but expresses his true feelings, and for me that was great. (view spoiler)[Also his relationship with Ean sounded so precious that I really, really wanted another novel just to learn about how they fell for each other. (hide spoiler)] While Ean wasn't my favourite, I approved of him because he didn't have to say much for Eadlyn to know how he felt about her and the palace and the Selection process. Kile developed a lot in this book too. He went from being someone who really didn't care about Eadlyn and the castle and wanted to run away from it to actually wanting to do things to change the castle and better it. Finally, Henri is the cutest little human being in the world. I wanted to pull him from the pages of the book and tuck him in my pocket to protect him forever because he's too sweet for this world and deserves so much better than having to deal with Eadlyn in any context. He was the only one who seemed to do whatever he could to make sure that everything was so bright and cheery, and he tried so hard to learn English for Eadlyn!!! Little sweetheart!As for the others, they were all okay in their own ways.Here's where the nonstop spoilers come in. (view spoiler)[Eadlyn falling for Eikko (Erik) was so...not well written? I have to admit when they first talked in The Heir I knew she was going to pick him or Kile, but there was little to no interaction between them that deserved this whole big romantic storyline that she seemed to narrate in The Crown. Having said that, their little romance was cute. I loved the way they exchanged rings in their own way because it showed that they had feelings for each other, but I thought it was downright stupid that Eadlyn kept insisting it'd never be because she was required to pick a boy from the Selection when she insisted in The Heir that she had the ability to call off the Selection at any time when she agreed to it. Also let's once again talk about Henri, because the ending scene where he grabbed their hands and told them both that he loved them and that they had to be together was SO CUTE.Speaking of that ending scene, the most ridiculous thing in this entire book was King Maxon's declaration about him committing treason. When Eadlyn ran up to him begging to marry Eikko I was expecting some hesitation but then an okay from him because he had his same spiel with America, but no off he goes into this story about how his dad beat him up as a kid and there was a mistress and half-sister drama with Lady Brice and NO. Just no. That was so unnecessary and immediately diverted my attention from an actually semi-decent ending for this overall average series. That was not necessary Kiera Cass, not in the slightest, and it jarred me out of actually caring about the book. (hide spoiler)]My overall feelings towards the book are basically summed up as cute, but will never read again. The Selection series was overall an average set of books that honestly should've stopped at book three, but that's fine. I didn't mind this book too much, the fourth I could've completely done without. Am I attached to Eadlyn? Absolutely not. I want to know more about the boys, though, but if anything else does come out attached to this series, I doubt I'll ever read it.[Eadlyn drops the Selection down to a final six Elite in the beginning of the novel (hide spoiler)][Also his relationship with Ean sounded so precious that I really, really wanted another novel just to learn about how they fell for each other.

The Crown est la digne fin d'une sU+00E9rie qui m'aura fait rU+00EAvU+00E9 pendant 4 annU+00E9es merveilleuses.Dans ce dernier tome, Eadlyn doit faire un choix. Mais aprU+00E8s la fin inattendue du tome prU+00E9cU+00E9dent, elle n'a malheureusement pas le cU+0153ur U+00E0 enchainer les rendez-vous avec ses divers prU+00E9tendants. Le peuple d'IllU+00E9a est mU+00E9content et Eadlyn aura besoin de tous les alliU+00E9s possibles, mU+00EAme de ceux dont elle doute.Lorsque j'ai dU+00E9butU+00E9 ma lecture, j'U+00E9tais angoissU+00E9e de savoir ce qui allait advenir U+00E0 l'un de mes personnages favoris de la sU+00E9rie. J'avais envie de voir Eadlyn U+00E9voluer bien sU+00FBr, mais je n'avais pas le cU+0153ur lU+00E9ger. Ce n'est que vers la moitiU+00E9 du roman, lorsque j'ai enfin eu l'esprit en paix, que j'ai U+00E0 nouveau pris goU+00FBt au flirt et aux rendez-vous. Et pour en avoir, il y en a! Ce n'est peut-U+00EAtre pas ce U+00E0 quoi plusieurs s'attendaient, mais personnellement, je ne pourrais U+00EAtre plus ravie du choix final d'Eadlyn. En terminant ma lecture, j'avais le cU+0153ur tellement gros que j'ai bien cru que j'allais pleurer de joie. Et juste U+00E0 y repenser, j'ai le sourire aux lU+00E8vres.En seulement deux tomes, Eadlyn a U+00E9normU+00E9ment U+00E9voluU+00E9, devenant ainsi une femme U+00E0 la fois forte et sensible. Je n'aurais jamais cru que c'U+00E9tait possible U+00E9tant donnU+00E9 le mU+00E9pris que j'avais pour elle au tout dU+00E9but du 4e tome. Mais sa force de caractU+00E8re m'a totalement conquise, et j'avouerais mU+00EAme que je la prU+00E9fU+00E8re peut-U+00EAtre U+00E0 America. Elle a ce petit je ne sais quoi de plus.Quant U+00E0 l'aspect dystopie, il est lU+00E9gU+00E8rement plus dU+00E9veloppU+00E9 dans ce dernier tome. Kiera Cass ne peut faire autrement que de boucler la bloucle, et elle le fait vraiment de maniU+00E8re admirable. Eadlyn n'a jamais U+00E9tU+00E9 la prU+00E9fU+00E9rU+00E9e du public, mais on peut voir qu'elle a U+00E0 cU+0153ur le bonheur de chacun des habitants d'IllU+00E9a.Et bien voilU+00E0. C'est la fin. AprU+00E8s 4 annU+00E9es U+00E0 attendre impatiemment le prochain tome de La SU+00E9lection, il n'y en aura plus. Kiera Cass a fait un travail admirable. Elle m'a conquise dU+00E8s la premiU+00E8re page du premier tome, U+00E0 un tel point que U+00E7a me fait mal de me dire que je viens de lire la derniU+00E8re page du tout dernier tome de la sU+00E9rie. Mais je me rU+00E9jouis en me disant que ses personnages vivront U+00E0 jamais dans mon imagination. Et que si l'envie m'en prend, je pourrai toujours ouvrir U+00E0 nouveau mon livre et me replonger dans leur histoire."},

Its definitely not on par with America and Maxon I just felt like it was too rushed and you never had the time to really see many special moments with Eadlyn and the selected guy."},

I could've accepted it if she had any romantic connection with the guy, though. But there was none. It was all too sudden. I was going to give it 2 stars but I upped it by one star for emotional attachment. Update: I'm giving it 2 stars again. I was browsing through my books I rated 3 stars and it didn't seem fair."},

Con eso sobre la mesa naciU+00F3 lo que nadie en su momento esperaba: un U+00E9xito desmesurado con el que aU+00F1os mU+00E1s tarde se vendieron otras novelas, comparU+00E1ndolas a esta misma.

U+00BFQue era su tU+00EDa? Pues eso, nuevo miembro para la familia real. Toma, ya. Y la segunda, pues la relaciU+00F3n homosexual de dos de los Seleccionados. Es un clichU+00E9 que decidas poner al que le gusta la moda como homosexual, U+00BFpero que le vamos ha hacer? La cosa es que el que le gustaba la moda se enamorU+00F3 de otro Seleccionado. Uno del que no sabemos mucho de el, salvo que es encantador, carismU+00E1tico.... Vamos que una cosa llevU+00F3 a la otra y ahU+00ED floreciU+00F3 el amor. Ead decide dejarles ir como enamorados que son y ella prosigue con su SelecciU+00F3n.A partir de aquU+00ED no hay mU+00E1s sorpresas. AsU+00ED que solo me queda lo negativo.Primero: U+00BFOs acordarais como Ead leU+00EDa la prensa informativa en The Heir, y bueno nos hacU+00EDa participes de los descontentos de los ProCastas? U+00BFSU+00ED? Pues vale. Olvidadaros de esas informaciones Kiera las tira por tierra, y si hace falta de hace un rebozado de croquetas con ello. AsU+00ED pues la buena de Ead, que era una chica aplicada por la polU+00EDtica de su paU+00EDs pasa de preocuparse de ese tipo de prensa a preocuparse y contentar a la prensa amarillista de U+00CDllea. SU+00ED seU+00F1oras y seU+00F1ores, todas las decisiones de Ead (la mayorU+00EDa de ellas) son en base a contentar a la prensa del cotilleo de su propio paU+00EDs. OlU+00E9 tu, Ead por tu involuciU+00F3n. OlU+00E9 tu.La segunda: U+00DAnica meta en doscientas y pico pU+00E1ginas: El matrimonio. No sU+00E9 cuantas veces he leU+00EDdo la palabra matrimonio. Si, ya lo sU+00E9, no os echU+00E9is encima, que ya se de que va la SelecciU+00F3n: de matrimonio. Pero os aseguro que sU+00ED me vendes esto como una distopU+00EDa, algo mU+00E1s que solo matrimonio tendrU+00E1 U+00BFno? Pues no, ya os lo digo yo. U+00BFOs acordU+00E1is de como he empezado la reseU+00F1a? U+00BFCon lo de Disney? Pues eso.La tercera: Eikko/Erik/Ahora me doy cuenta que suspiro por ti. Antes que nada, os aviso que yo apostaba por Erik como interU+00E9s romU+00E1ntico de Ead, solo que no asU+00ED de mal desarrollado. Vamos, que resulta que en el anterior libro, en la famosilla pelea de la cocina, te das cuenta que te gusta el susodicho y Kiera no decide contarnos que empieza a sentir algo desde ese momento. No que va. Nada de nada. Eso no lo intuimos hasta que se miran un par de veces, se intentan besar otro par de veces y poco mU+00E1s. El amor es de TOMA, PUM, ME GUSTA. Y nada, tenemos que conformarnos con creernos la historia, porque claro (aquU+00ED va otra expresiU+00F3n que se repite hasta la sociedad) su historia puede ser como la de sus padres: un cuento de hadas...La cuarta: La incongruencia. SU+00ED, sU+00ED, la incongruencia U+00BFque querU+00E9is que os diga? Hace unos instantes os he comentado que Ead nos dice que se enamorU+00F3 de Erik en la pelea de las cocinas. U+00BFOs acordU+00E1is? U+00BFSU+00ED? Pues vale. En un escenario un poco distinto uno de los pretendientes se declara a Ead (U+00A1que romU+00E1ntico es todo aquU+00ED eh!) Cosa que la deja pasmada y que no tarda en compartir con Neena, que la informa de que le parece raro que le dijera el hombrecillo que justo se habU+00EDa enamorado de ella en las cocinas, que todo eso le olU+00EDa a chamusquina...Creo que lo que me hace dudar U+2014empecU+00E9 U+2014 es el hecho de que empezara a sentir algo especial por mU+00ED justo la noche de la pelea en las cocinasVamos, no me jodas. U+00BFQue la protagonista si puede enamorarse en una cocina y el hombrecillo de la SelecciU+00F3n, no? U+00BFPero que me estU+00E1is vendiendo?Vale, ya paro. Si os soy sincera pienso que Kiera apoderarU+00E1 los genes de Casandra Clare y nos darU+00E1 mil versiones de su mundoU+00BFPor quU+00E9? Por el hermano de Ead que dice que nunca se saltarU+00EDa las normas, pensando en Kiera, seguro que ya le tiene una historU+00EDa prohibida para el. Fijo.U+00BFQue ha supuesto para mi este U+00FAltimo libro? Poco, la verdad, la idea de casarte porque te hace femenina delante de la naciU+00F3n y no masculina no me gusta. Pienso que Ead tenU+00EDa mas capacidades para gustar a su gente, que no centrarse solo en eso. Pero bueno U+00BFque mU+00E1s da?Otra cosa que he echado a faltar: explicaciones. U+00BFQue ha pasado con los rebeldes de Cristina/Cristine? Aquellos de los de la cruz U+00BFos acordU+00E1is? Por quU+00E9 yo si. Como aquellos diarios de Gregor, que nadie ha echado a faltar. Me falta informaciU+00F3n U+00BFAU+00FAn existen rebeldes en U+00CDllea que repudian lo que suponen las clases sociales? Bah mU+00E1s cosas, incongruntes. Os acodU+00E1is como les echan en cara a los del pueblo que deciden hablar con Ead, que Ead ha diferencia del pueblo no podU+00EDa elegir su profesiU+00F3n, que prU+00E1cticamente eran unos dioses por poder elegir. Vale con esto en la mano U+00BFque pasa con esa mujer que te U+00E9sta lavando el retrete? U+00BFTambiU+00E9n ha tenido elecciU+00F3n como el resto?

Que se interpongan cosas asU+00ED sin sentido alguno me asquea. U+00BFPero que mU+00E1s da?Ya esta. Seguro que pocos coincidirU+00E9is conmigo.

Her idea isn't too original. The world-building is almost non-existent. This book won't be winning prizes any time soon. However, I still really enjoyed it. Hardcore breakdown: the series as a wholeI give the entire series a 3/5. It's not the best thing to ever happen to me, but it's also easy reading with lighthearted plot. It's basically contemporary-dystopian if that makes sense. There's not a lot of focus on actual world-building or conflict. The emphasis of this series is the characters and their thoughts, feelings, etc. It's 100% clean, so a great series to start off with for new/younger readers. I always finish a Kiera Cass book in record time because her books are like crack. Once you start you can't stop until you're done. Softcore breakdown: my reflections on this bookI'll start with the things I liked. The Crown was a great book to pull me out of my reading slump. It's princess-y enough and contemporary enough to kind of numb my brain without being \"fluffy.\" I enjoyed Cass's themes and her reiteration of \"love takes work\" kind of thing. Eadlyn has really grown as a character, and I've enjoyed getting to know her. What I did not like: Part One, the impersonalHere we go. I think it's fair to say that I liked The Heir a lot more than The Crown, and I liked The Selection best of all. Nothing can beat the original Selection in my heart because I read it when I was first getting involved in YA and Goodreads. That being said, there are undeniable issues with The Crown...A is for Aspen I don't know about anyone else, but I was a little uncomfortable with Aspen being \"Eadlyn's other parent\" in her words. Maxon, Aspen, and America are all very close--much closer than they appeared in the fourth book--and I found it weird. Would you want your wife's serious ex-boyfriend that close with your kids? I can understand keeping him around and promoting him, I can even understand the occasional family dinner. What I didn't like was him being \"the third parent.\" B is for Brice(view spoiler)[At the very end of the book, Maxon reveals that King Clarkson had a mistress and that mistress got pregnant with Maxon's half-sister. This also made me uncomfortableAll we hear about Clarkson is that he's a butthole with a major soft spot for his wife. He basically hated everyone but her. So WHAT'S WITH THE MISTRESS? Where did this even come from? Couldn't we have left Lady Brice alone? Did we really need another wrench in this plot line? It was too much at the very end. I mean, there were eight pages left and Maxon drops the \"you have an aunt\" bomb. I didn't like it.  (hide spoiler)]C is for CrownEadlyn's love story felt a bit forced to me. Like one moment she had zero feelings for her choice, and the next she was in love. Again, I get that this is more of a fuzzy love story than a hardcore dystopian romance, but it still felt awkward in the beginning stages. She didn't end up with who I thought she'd end up with, and at first I was really aggravated. As the story went on, I started to accept it, and it was fine. But, again, it all felt very rushed and forced seeing as how the first Selection took three books, and this one was over in two. What I did not like: Part Two, the personalLet me just break out my soap box and stand up for a moment. I do not appreciate YA authors intertwining their personal political stances within their fictional stories ***It is not my intention to take a stance on any of the following issues within this review, only to point out what I see as a flaw***Over and over and over again, I have seen YA authors bring up present day politics in their books. This is problematic because not everyone loves Barak Obama, supports gay marriage, votes Republican or Democratic, believes in God as Christians know him, or believes in God at all. These opinions should be (A)brushed over or (B) left out of fictional stories because they are FICTIONAL worlds. They hardly concern the characters. You can have a gay character without taking a stance on gay marriage. You can have a muslim or a Christian or an atheist character without taking a stance on religion. I do profess to be a Christian, so I love seeing Christian influence in YA. For this part, I am mostly talking about political platforms. During The Crown, we have someone \"come out of the closet.\" I felt that it cheapened the whole thing. It was more of a convenient way to get rid of two contestants than something that actually added to character and plot. That kind of thing demands planning, and time, and a deeply emotional moment. I understand that homosexual characters are more and more popular as the LBGT movement grows across the nation. But if you're going to do something, do it on purpose. Do it right. Don't just throw it in there. Kiera Cass was not the worst example of this I've ever seen. Not at all.  This just happened to be the straw that broke the camels back, and I felt the need to address this in my review. If you disagree with me, so be it. If you think I'm being a heartless B, feel free to unfriend me. I would never want to force my opinion on someone else. At the end of the day, I don't know if I'm better off for reading the fourth and fifth book in this series, or if the original Selection was magical enough to stand on its own. If you're a diehard Selection fan, then I'd recommend you finish it out. But if you're not, you might just want to leave it as is. Happy reading!

I know IU+2019m unreasonable but I just felt that way.First, Eadlyn had to choose a guy for her Selection; thatU+2019s what this book is about, right? So she did. But IU+2019m so disappointed in who she chose (I know this probably shouldnU+2019t be a problem because everyone has their taste..) and the events were just a little crazy in my opinion. Suddenly this whole romance thing between Eadlyn and her boy seemed very insta love like and I just didnU+2019t like that.. I just prefer another boy who she could have fallen in love with!Also, can we talk about the last 100 pages? Because they were chaotic as hell. I mean, everything that probably could have happen, happened and it went by so fast. Too fast, if you ask me. I couldnU+2019t maintain the pace and if this book was just 100 pages longer I think it would be so much better. This doesnU+2019t take away the epicness of the events: because that was a thing that Kiera did very well. Because of all the events, the story had to take a turn and that was one I didnU+2019t expect at all.But that Epilogue guys??? What was that? The only thought I had was: U+2018CanU+2019t we get more, is this it?U+2019 because I think that was the most crappy epilogue ever. DonU+2019t get me wrong, I loved the idea behind it (like, the refering to the beginning of The Heir) but shouldnU+2019t a Epilogue be all about the life AFTER the end? Like fine, Eadlyn chose her guy, but canU+2019t we at least get their happy ending?And this book isnU+2019t all bad guys, because there are a lot of things I was happy about. Example: Eadlyn. I loved her story and how she evolved throughout the series. First she was a bitch, but right now she is so sweet and understanding.. I loved that development and thatU+2019s absolutely a big plus!I know, IU+2019m awfully cruel by writing this review, especially because Kiera Cass once used to be my favorite author (well guys.. she probably still is), but I just felt that way when I read it and I wish it didnU+2019t give me the feeling that it had to be rushed, just for itU+2019s releasing date sake.

I don't balme her for being stressed. Even through all this, Eadlyn still continues to be a strong female character without being mean, and showing that she can love the same things as anyone else, without being a terrible person.

Their personal life has really evolved, and I love seeing this side of them. The way they were depicted in The Heir... they didn't seem like themselves; just replicas. I waited a whole year for this book; I read The Heir as soon as it came out, just as I had The Crown. I am disappointed. I loved the original three books with all my heart, even though they all had moments where they could have been better. But... Eadlyn's Selection is a miss for me. I wonder if it would have been better if Kiera never written about Eadlyn at all.I love Kiera's writing, I love the Selection series, but I don't love this book.

It reminded me of The Bachelor with a twist and I was hooked from the start. This series has been so addictive.I reviewed The Heir recently, you can read that here, which IU+2019d heard mixed reviews on. Especially about Eadlyn but I liked her. Not as much as America and she did annoy me a little at the start of The Heir but she did grow on me through the book and she really stepped up in The Crown. Eadlyn is the first woman in inherit the throne and that has put a lot of pressure on her as sheU+2019s grown up. SheU+2019s had to deal with the people of Illea doubting her ability to lead but instead of letting what people think of her get under her skin it makes her want to prove them wrong, that she is a capable leader and does have what it takes. And I think she definitely proved that in The Crown.I was really interested to find out how EadlynU+2019s Selection ended. IU+2019m not going to give anything away but I will say there were two guys that I could see her with and she ended up choosing one of them. I think she did the right thing with the other guy too and I also think she made the right decision.I loved seeing that America and MaxonU+2019s relationship hadnU+2019t changed at all from the first three books. And I loved to see them with their children. Because The Heir and The Crown were from EadlynU+2019s perspective there wasnU+2019t as much shown with Ahren, Kaden, Osten and their parents but there were some good scenes where it was obvious that America and Maxon were great parents. I loved Osten!I loved the ending of The Crown, everything was wrapped up nicely and Eadlyn had the last word with one very annoying person. I loved it.IU+2019m so glad that I gave The Selection a chance instead of dismissing it because it reminded me of The Bachelor, which IU+2019m not a fan of.

I don't think these books are written with enough sophistication, complexity nor depth to pull off a story like this. It just felt a little ridiculous. If you enjoyed the first three books in this series and are contemplating whether to read The Heir and The Crown, I wouldn't say to not read them as your experience may differ from my own. Based on The Heir I would say definitely give it a try, as I just really loved that book, but this one really is a disappointment. Maybe it's a personal thing, but I really felt this book was a let down.THE REST OF THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS. SO PLEASE STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THIS BOOK. What the heck was with who Eadlyn chose? I felt let down completely. That was such an odd and unexpected choice that really had no buildup nor investment. It was so sudden that I never really got a chance to like them together. I felt a little betrayed to be honest. I get why Kiera Cass made Eadlyn choose Erik, because he was not a part of the selection itself, so it really showed how she had learnt to equalise herself as a ruler and as a person. I get that, and I like that. But what the heck. Where was the lead up? All through The Heir I thought Erik was like a thirty year old, so I was utterly confused when they started hinting that she and him may become a romantic item. I either completely missed something there, or it was as sudden and rushed as I think. But anyway, what is done is done. I will fondly look back on The Selection, and try to not let the disappointment of this book overshadow the enjoyment I got from the other four books. "},

They make a cute couple. Much like the other book I just read, Me Before You, the romance part of The Crown took a back seat. The fifth book in the Selection series was more about politics, since Eadlyn took over for her father while he stayed with his wife. I took delight in the fact that Kiera wrote her last book like that since it was interesting to see the problems that IllU+00E9a faces and it wasnU+2019t at all boring. I loved The Crown.

Hope fans all around are displeased by you. :)By Super Angry Kile shipper Okay so I went back and read the final Kile part and really honey? Yes he has his dreams but huh you guys could've been together and fulfill his dream all at the same time. It's just all a sad excuse because she fell for THE OTHER STUPID GUY because it would show that TRUE LOVE CONQUERS ALL but it's just so cliche I can't even. Ugh I hate it when people make the MC end up with someone just because they want to send a seemingly \"bigger\" message but in the end really who cares? People would still want them to end up with the guy who has the most chemistry with the MC so get over the whole damn message shit. God I haven't been so angry at a book in a while. Such a fucking rip off. To think that my ship sunk for the sake of a fucking plot device is just cheap."},

My major dislike of The Crown was how I predicted everything from a mile away. Sure, I turned the pages in the correct order (besides checking the ending I'd already predicted), but I felt as if Kiera Cass was whispering what was to happen in my ear. Untrustworthy characters, plot twists... All of that.Overall, The Crown was quite an interesting book.

Sus padres, Maxon y AmU+00E9rica, se conocieron allU+00ED y siempre ha visto eso como una bonita historia de amor. Sin embargo, cuando llegaron a su vida treinta y cinco pretendientes, aquello parecU+00EDa un caos y un torbellino. Varias semanas han pasado y AmU+00E9rica ha sufrido un infarto de corazU+00F3n. Hospitalizada, Maxon no es capaz de seguir liderando a todo un paU+00EDs con la tremenda preocupaciU+00F3n que tiene encima, por lo que Eadlyn se convierte en la lU+00EDder momentU+00E1nea. Con la presiU+00F3n bajo sus hombros, no le queda mU+00E1s remedio que acelerar La SelecciU+00F3n. Pero los problemas no acaban ahU+00ED, ya que el pueblo de Illea la odia tanto que no es capaz de comprender cU+00F3mo va a llevar a un paU+00EDs que no la quiere en el trono. Mientras recibe la ayuda de alguien conocido hace mucho tiempo, Eadlyn estU+00E1 en la situaciU+00F3n de tener a seis pretendientes dispuestos a darlo todo por ella. Y aunque las primeras semanas no querU+00EDa saber nada de ellos, los nuevos sucesos que van ocurriendo y que ponen a Eadlyn en el punto de mira, hacen que la princesa sepa que necesita a alguien en quiU+00E9n apoyarse. Eadlyn todavU+00EDa no estU+00E1 segura de quU+00E9 es lo que va a encontrar siguiendo el camino que sus padres hicieron hace veinte aU+00F1os. Pero a veces el corazU+00F3n tiene una forma de sorprender y pronto Eadlyn debe hacer una elecciU+00F3n imposible y que nunca imaginU+00F3.Como ya os dije en la reseU+00F1a de La Heredera, cuando me enterU+00E9 de que la autora habU+00EDa decidido alargar ese magnU+00EDfico final de La Elegida con dos libros mU+00E1s, pero cambiando a los protagonistas, no me hizo mucha ilusiU+00F3n. Pero como tenU+00EDa curiosidad, al final acabU+00F3 ganando esto y me atrevU+00ED a ver quU+00E9 es lo que habU+00EDa hecho. La Corona es el U+00FAltimo libro de una saga que, si bien se hubiera quedado U+00FAnicamente con los tres primeros libros, tampoco hubiera pasado nada. SU+00ED, La Heredera me gustU+00F3 por el cambio de aires y el toque original de un programa que pensaba mU+00E1s que exprimido y tenU+00EDa esperanzas de seguir vislumbrU+00E1ndolo en La Corona, pero no ha sido asU+00ED. Regresando ala narraciU+00F3n en primera persona a travU+00E9s de la voz de Eadlyn, este libro empieza con algo de lentitud debido a los sucesos que finalizaron el anterior libro, haciendo que el proceso de la selecciU+00F3n se quede rezagado para dar prioridad a los primeros miedos de la protagonista y a su primer paso como gobernante del paU+00EDs. Creo que La Corona ha servido mU+00E1s para consolidar a Eadlyn como reina de Illea que para encontrar ese pretendiente que la acompaU+00F1arU+00E1 a lo largo de su reinado. En cierto modo, la historia se lee tan rU+00E1pido como las demU+00E1s, Cass sigue apostando por unos capU+00EDtulos muy directos, lejos de las complicaciones, y dejando momentos bastante buenos entre los protagonistas. Pero tambiU+00E9n ha sido un libro donde la polU+00EDtica ha estado mU+00E1s presente, juntU+00E1ndose con el problema que ya viene arrastrU+00E1ndose desde el libro anterior con el nuevo sistema de las castas y la disconformidad que hay. U+00BFPienso que ha sido un cambio bueno? SU+00ED. Y la razU+00F3n es simple: la selecciU+00F3n se vuelve sosa en La Corona, vuelve a mostrar algo que ya estU+00E1 visto en los libros anteriores, no aporta nada nuevo, y lo que podrU+00EDa haber sido un libro de puro relleno viendo como Eadlyn consigue aclarar sus sentimientos y elige a la persona indicada, es en realidad el final de su selecciU+00F3n dotada de unos temas que, si bien ya se habU+00EDan complementado antes, aquU+00ED vuelven a hacerlo para darnos algo mU+00E1s.La Corona es una conclusiU+00F3n que no decepciona, eso os lo digo desde ya. U+00C1gil, amena, directa y corta, es una lectura muy entretenida, y no es tan predecible como he leU+00EDdo en algunas partes. Es cierto que la selecciU+00F3n es la misma, se vuelve a repetir lo que ya vivimos con AmU+00E9rica, pero Eadlyn estU+00E1 hecha un lU+00EDo y el ir y venir con tantos pretendientes hace que, al final, la decisiU+00F3n que tome te pilla totalmente desprevenida. Al menos, yo, no me la esperaba. Sin embargo, no es oro todo lo que reluce ya que, aunque haya disfrutado este libro, tambiU+00E9n es verdad que este nuevo arco argumental lo he vivido y sentido mucho menos. Lo que recalcarU+00EDa de La Corona como punto negativo es que me esperaba mU+00E1s por una parte, la polU+00EDtica y las castas. Sabemos que desde que Maxon eliminU+00F3 ese sistema mucha gente no lo ha llegado a aceptar del todo y se dice en varias ocasiones que no quieren a Eadlyn como reina. Pensaba que Cass iba a sacarle mU+00E1s partido a una rebeliU+00F3n que se queda U+00FAnicamente entre cuatro paredes y un grupo pequeU+00F1o de personas, por lo que se descarta la acciU+00F3n que imaginaba. Por otro lado estU+00E1 el tema de los pretendientes, que se me han quedado muy planos. EstU+00E1n todo el dU+00EDa detrU+00E1s de Eadlyn, alabando su belleza e inteligencia, y se me han quedado como pelotas y sosos. AdemU+00E1s, he sentido como si la autora quisiera acabar de una vez con la selecciU+00F3n y ha puesto resoluciones apresuradas a mU+00E1s de uno que me han sabido a poco.Con respecto a los personajes, decir que me he podido reconciliar con Eadlyn. En La Heredera me desesperU+00F3 muchU+00EDsimo y me decepcionU+00F3, sobre todo viendo que America y Maxon son los padres. No podU+00EDa entender como Kiera habU+00EDa construido un personaje tan engreU+00EDdo, malcriado y egocU+00E9ntrico. Pero, no se si serU+00E1 por el infarto de AmU+00E9rica o porque se ha visto sola despuU+00E9s de que su hermano se haya ido, a Eadlyn la he visto muy mejorada. Sigue teniendo pensamientos de superioridad, pero no se acentU+00FAa tanto su personalidad como en el libro anterior. EstU+00E1 mucho mU+00E1s centrada, es mU+00E1s madura, estU+00E1 mU+00E1s abierta y relajada. La he visto mU+00E1s natural, sin demasiadas tensiones, mU+00E1s carismU+00E1tica. Y me ha gustado lo bien que se le da gobernar y dar U+00F3rdenes, ahU+00ED si que se nota que Maxon es su padre; de los pretendeintes, destacar a Henri, que me parece una monada de chico. Me ha encantado esa inocencia que tiene, esa determinaciU+00F3n para conquistar a Eadlyn a pesar de sus dificultades, no rindiU+00E9ndose nunca; Erik, ese saber estar, la paciencia que emana, la tranquilidad que posee; o Kile, ese pretendiente soU+00F1ador que busca mejorar el paU+00EDs con cualquier cosa.Con La Corona digo adiU+00F3s una saga inolvidable. Me enamorU+00E9 con La SelecciU+00F3n y de sus personajes y con Eadlyn he vuelto a querer todo este mundo. De manera muy directa, con una mejora en la protagonista y aU+00F1adiU+00E9ndole emociU+00F3n hacia el final, es un punto y final agridulce solo porque sU+00E9 que, a partir de ahora, no habrU+00E1 mU+00E1s libros sobre IllU+00E9a."},

This review and more can be found on my blog www.lebookchronicles.com Oh My God It is finally here, the final installment of The Selection series!! I donU+2019t know how I feel about that to be honest. I don't think anything will compare to the original Selection, but this mini spin-off duology has been amazing. I only wish it had of been a trilogy as I feel like so much was cut out to ensure it fit into two. But any who, The Crown had to be my most anticipated book of 2016 and it definitely did not disappoint. By no means was it perfect, and it definitely did not go in the direction I originally thought it would, but it was a really good conclusion to an amazing series.Those who didn't like Eadlyn in The Heir will be happy to hear that she had some major character development in The Crown! A lot of people donU+2019t like Eadlyn because of her selfishness and arrogance but that definitely changes in The Crown. It was like she was a completely different person. She had compassion, she cared about things other than herself, she grew more mature, and she was forced to actually take responsibility for her actions for once. It was fantastic!Surprisingly enough I was hoping for a little more action in this book. In the original trilogy you see a lot of action with the rebels and with Marlee, Aspen and the whole massacre thing but you get nothing like that in The Crown. There was a little bit of excitement at random points throughout the book, but for the most part, it was focused on (view spoiler)[Eadlyn learning to take her role as Regent, taking over the throne and narrowing down the selection. (hide spoiler)]I do wish we got to see more relationship building. I understand it would have been hard to do as the story was only a duology rather than a trilogy, but I feel a lot of the political stuff could have been left out to include more romance. Also, so much time was spent with Eadlyn being so confused about what she wanted to do that by the time she realised, nearly three quarters of the book was gone.Having said that, I loved how the romance came about and I loved her final decision. I donU+2019t think I can say much more without giving anything away but I'll discuss it in the spoilery part at the end.I donU+2019t really know what to say to be honest. My favourite series has come to an end so my feels are all over the place right now! Of course there were several things that I would have preferred differently, but I can definitely see why some things happened and I think as a whole it did not take away from my enjoyment of the book. So overall, I am very happy with how this series ended (particularly after reading the bonus epilogue) it was all wrapped up nicely and I feel sufficiently satisfied :)Would I recommend? YES!For fans of: The Selection Series (find my reviews for those here)Overall Rating: 4.5/5Bonus Epilogue:So, there is a bonus epilogue. BUT that was only available in the Barnes and Noble editions in America! How ridiculous/unfair is that?!?!? It added so much closure to the story I don't understand why they would make it a special thing only available to a limited amount of people? Either way, someone was kind enough to upload the epilogue, so if you would like to read that (which if you've read The Crown I would suggest because otherwise you're not really getting the whole story are you?) you can find it here. (view spoiler)[And if you did read it is anyone else confused as to why it was all about Josie? It would make sense if there was going to be a spin-off series about her but I donU+2019t think thatU+2019s the case, so IU+2019m just confused. I still loved it though don't get me wrong! (hide spoiler)]Spoilery Discussion:(view spoiler)[I never thought I would say this but I loved the way everything turned out. From book 1 (as in The Heir) I considered myself #team Kile, I would not budge. If youU+2019re friends with me on Goodreads you would have seen that throughout most of this book I was still firmly #teamKile. But as I got further into it I realised there was no real reason for them to get together.

In book one I felt like it was between Kile and Erik but I thought for SURE she would end up with Kile because of their history and everything. I still don't think that we got enough relationship building between Eadlyn and Erik. I don't know, I have a lot to say about this but I feel like this is getting really long.

But I don't know, I think I was very excited when reading that book, because we got to go back to that story after thinking that it was just going to be a trilogy.And then came The Crown...  When I started reading this, I told myself that maybe we would get to know the boys a bit better, since I thought we didn't get a chance to do so in The Heir, which was very upsetting, because I wasn't rooting for any of them. I didn't really care about any of the boys. I didn't know them.But that never happened! We never get to really know these boys and suddenly we're supposed to believe that she loved this one boy all along?? Uhm, no.  I like her choice, I guess. But there were no feelings whatsoever, no love. I didn't feel a thing. I loved reading about Maxon and America in the trilogy, I was rooting for them and the revolution, and I wanted to see them happy. But Eadlyn's story... I didn't care about her or the boys, which is very sad, really. And even though I liked Ahren in the previous book, he just seemed like a lousy son and brother in this one.But seriously, the only part that I kind of enjoyed wasn't even about this new generation, it's about Maxon and America, when he starts sharing with Eadlyn things about their past and a little something about his father, which did make sense to me, the guy was awful, but I wouldn't say that it was relevant though.It all felt kind of rushed... The rest of the selection, Eadlyn suddenly being more responsible over night, her choosing a husband... Even the announcement where she lets people know which guy she picked. I don't think it took her longer than a couple of minutes.Also, there's no character development to be seen. When I finished reading, I thought I'd be happy to know that Eadlyn (apparently) found the love of her life, or that I got to (kind of) meet America's and Maxon's new family... But no, I didn't feel a thing. I didn't even remember half of the boys!... I don't know those boys, I never knew those boys.Even the characters from the trilogy felt so OOC. I let it slide in The Heir, but I just couldn't stand it anymore in this book.And that epilogue... What??Oh well, at least Eadlyn stopped behaving like a brat.

But then the author goes and writes two new books exactly about the family they raised, and itU+2019s nothing you expected and all your wishes are dashed? Maybe this is a bit dramatic, but I feel this way about both The Heir and The Crown. My favourite things about both books is seeing Maxon and America so absolutely in love with each other, and of course the covers of both books. Because look at them!Besides both of those points, I really didnU+2019t care much about Eadlyn or her Selection. I was curious as to who sheU+2019d end up with, as I had no idea at the end of The Heir, and it was nice to see her grow and develop as a person as well as a future queen, but other than that, my overall feeling over them is meh. Which is really quite sad as I thought the ending to The One was perfect and couldnU+2019t have been happier with it. I think I'd be happier pretending that was the true ending to this series and these books donU+2019t exist.EadlynU+2019s Selection continues in this book as she attempts to find a suitor among her Elite boys that she wants to spend the rest of her life with. However, unlike with her parents, there isnU+2019t one boy who stands out among the rest (at least, not immediately), and I quite enjoyed seeing her sort through her feelings for each boy and try and figure out if she could spend the rest of her life with one. We also see her act as regent queen after her motherU+2019s heart attack. I loved how she took this role so incredibly seriously. Eadlyn is very self-centred and spoilt. Knowing sheU+2019s going to be queen got to her head and it didnU+2019t make her a likeable character; to me or the people of IllU+00E9a. But sheU+2019s painstakingly aware of this in this book and tries her best to make decisions that would appease her people, and I really loved her development. She still isnU+2019t my favourite character ever, and I doubt she ever will be, but I can appreciate how Cass made her grow. As for the romanceU+2026 itU+2019s sweet. We see Eadlyn bond with all six boys remaining in the Elite and see her try and sort out her feelings for each one. There were three boys I had a really strong feeling Eadlyn was going to pick, and she did pick the one I had suspected. Did I have strong feelings between the two of them together? Not as strong as Maxon and America. Because Eadlyn also had to be romantic with other members of the Elite, we werenU+2019t given a lot of time for them to develop a really strong connection. The few moments we did get with them were genuine and sweet, but quite few and far in between. My final verdict? I would skip this book, as well as The Heir, if I were you. They arenU+2019t as gripping as the first three books in the series, and the romance isnU+2019t as spellbinding. Remember, this is my personal opinion, so donU+2019t take it to heart, especially if you enjoyed this book or enjoyed The Heir. If you did, good for you! Maybe youU+2019ll get more out of this ending than I did. It just didnU+2019t satisfy me in the way The One did. That will be the true ending for me."},

Con una protagonista distinta pienso que la autora quizU+00E1 debiU+00F3 haber creado la historia en libros aparte, no que siguiera la cronologU+00EDa de los libros anteriores, por asU+00ED decirlo, ya que este U+00FAltimo, en su parte final, todo se me iba haciendo demasiado rU+00E1pido, muy apresurado.

Pero algo me faltU+00F3.TenU+00EDa muy claro algo que pasarU+00EDa. Era algo que veU+00EDa venir: sin spoilers ni sin saber nada del libro, se me hacU+00EDa evidente que Eadlyn se enamorarU+00EDa de alguien fuera de La SelecciU+00F3n misma, y debo decir que me agradU+00F3 bastante el cambio de los acontecimientos. Eadlyn nunca me cayU+00F3 mal... lo que me pasU+00F3 en The Heir fue que lo que pasaba dentro de La SelecciU+00F3n en especU+00EDfico lo encontraba un poco... absurdo. Como las \"citas\" y esas cosas. Pero aquU+00ED en ningU+00FAn momento sentU+00ED algo asU+00ED como risorio ni ridU+00EDculo, pero eso el libro me gustU+00F3 mucho mU+00E1s que el anteriorBueno y el final. El final me gustU+00F3, lo encontrU+00E9 tierno pero de todas maneras seguirU+00E9 sintiendo que algo me falta, como que la historia podrU+00EDa continuar pero no. Eso no pasarU+00E1, tampoco no sU+00E9 si me gustarU+00EDa que pasara. Pero en dos libros solamente, todo pasa demasiado rU+00E1pido, mU+00E1s encima que son libros cortos, entonces el \"amor\" de Eadlyn y Eikko, no sU+00E9 si se podrU+00E1 decir frustrado o muy acelerado, pero en poco tiempo ella se dio cuenta de sus sentimientos, cuando supuestamente era dura como una roca, lol, en fin... si hubieran sido mU+00E1s libros (no sU+00E9, tres al menos) su enamoramiento se hubiera visto no de forma tan repentina sino mU+00E1s fluido y no como tan \"el libro tiene que acabar, asU+00ED que hagamos que se enamore\" lolAparte, Eadlyn deja ver su parte \"amable\" y en todo el libro se preocupa bastante por el \"quU+00E9 dirU+00E1n\" las personas de ella y tal vez, sin darse cuenta, sus actos eran de lo mU+00E1s generosos, sin hacerlo tan notorio: como de lo Hale y Ean, lo de Kile... en fin. TambiU+00E9n es para darle trama al libro, bueno, todo es en base a eso pero no es tan mala ni pesada como la autora quiere que creamos por lo que dice la gente de ella.

I kept expecting all those hints about politics and revolution to come to a clever point in The One, but I was sorely disappointed in that one because it just stomped over all the foreshadowing and focused on the love story. That was supposed to be the end of the trilogy, but then there was effectively a reboot with The Heir. In response to America being too perfect (impoverished, beautiful, trilingual chanteuse who's the only girl who doesn't want to be a princess and demands to wear pants but everyone loves her anyways), Princess Eadlyn was made deliberately unlikeable...

I'll be honest and say that upon first glance, my impressions weren't necessarily optimistic and positive - the cover came across as clichU+00E9 and the resemblance to The Bachelor made me cringe BUT OH HOW WRONG I WAS. Little did I know that this series would introduce me to a fiery, sassy and kind female protagonist and a heart destroying love interest. I fell in love with this story, the characters and very early found myself routing for America and Maxon (the love I have for them is real ladies and gentlemen, it is real).Favourite quote: \"This is a dandelion,U+201D I told him. He shrugged. \"I know. Some see a weed; some see a flower. Perspective\". In comparison to the Heir (where Edalyn displayed a lack of empathy, was stubborn, headstrong, self-centered and as Kile would say U+2018a royal pain in the assU+2019, in the Crown Edalyn goes through SIGNIFICANT CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. She quickly becomes caring, empathic, determined, AND THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE of how she was initially introduced. If you were previously U+201Cput offU+201D from the main protagonist and are now contemplating whether you should endure an additional 280 pages, here is your answer, YES YOU SHOULD. The drama and plot twists ARE EPIC, the blurb of this book does not lie when it depicts U+201Can epic conclusionU+201D. I cried, I screamed, threw my book to the ground, punched the air and clutched my heart numerously throughout this book, to say I enjoyed it would be an utter understatement. This conclusion was everything I expected and more, NO ACTUALLY, it was nothing like what I expected. Kiera could have taken the finale in a completely different route, she COULD HAVE made it extremely clichU+00E9 and typical BUT SHE DIDNU+2019T and IU+2019m am so so content with life right now.

She was extremely worried about it, and then she was like whatever I love you so it doesn't matter.I don't know if Kiera Cass was just wanting to end it in this book, but it felt so rushed and it wasn't as good as her other writing. It almost felt as if this book was written because she started the story of Eadlyn, but halfway through writing The Crown she lost inspiration, but she's already committed to it so she might as well finish.I'm sorry if this is harsh but I paid $17 for this at Walmart, so there was a couple dollars off.

Sniff!Hale assists with her gown for an episode of the Report; Henri happily attends a lunch date with her, needing his translator Erik, who is still friendly and sweet.

While I did like the basic idea of the story, Eadlyn pretty much spoilt everything for me. I didn't like her characterization at all, and by the time I finished the book I was fervently praying for her to have a lot of character growth in the next book at least. While that did happen in The Crown, I was nevertheless dissatisfied with the story.Going into this book, I was, understandably, quite wary. I didn't dare hope for the magic that was America's and Maxon's love story, but my poor heart did expect Kiera Cass to be back in all her awesomeness in narrating a beautiful fairytale. That. Did. Not. Happen. Here's why:Also: Look, I'm all for finding your soulmate and well, la-di-dah, you can ride into your goddamned sunset and live happily ever after. But when it comes about with zero development, I say no. Please, no. I had this constant nagging feeling that things were happening just because the author wanted them to, and not because the characters did. Get what I mean? I thought America had much better chemistry with Kile. I was rooting for them from the very beginning- I love the idea of childhood friends turning lovers. Granted, it would have been predictable but it's the kind of ending I felt was fitting given their individual natures and their growth from being friends to more. Kile was very clear about his intentions and it made no sense to me when he just nodded along to what Eadlyn had to say. I'm sure something could have been worked out for his ambitions about seeing the world and all that.Eadlyn's choice was completely flabbergasting. Apart from Kile, I only ever felt a connect with Henri, and that ended stupidly as well. Why does everyone just agree to what she has to say and not voice their own opinions? I can't believe Henri just stepped back and paved the way for Erik. Come on. He was sweet-natured, but no one is as sweet-natured as that. Eadlyn sure was much more bearable here than in the previous book and showed surprising growth of character, but her decisions truly baffle me. She goes around feeling nothing at all about Erik and suddenly after one genuinely bewildering conversation she's convinced that they are soulmates. She was reading too much into their past encounters, if you ask me. She doesn't even realize that he's her \"soulmate\" up until about 80% of the book and then she's all moon-eyed about him and scolding her \"treacherous heart\" for betraying her. Puh-lease. U+201CYou are always just Eadlyn. And you are always the queen. You are everything to everyone. And infinitely more to me.U+201D If this were a better-written book, I would be all smiling when reading stuff such as this one, but here, I was just very frustrated. Why not give them more chance to grow together as a couple? Sure, they didn't have much time, and that brings me to my other concern: why was everything so rushed at the end? It's like the author, like us, just wanted to see an end to the series and tied up all the loose knots in a hurry. Talk about convenience! The boys each get eliminated so bloody conveniently that I was all, \"Ha, should've seen that coming!\" when things started happening. Pointless reveals at the end aside, this book could have been much, much better if the author had taken time to focus on everything, instead of just wrapping up everything haphazardly. And I would have loved this story much more if I had actually felt anything towards the characters. Final thoughts: Kind of a pointless read if you're not looking for any sort of closure to Eadlyn's story.The story idea: 3/5The realization of the story: 2/5The characters: 2/5 The cover: 2/5Enjoy factor: 2/5Final Rating: 2/5"},

Are we interested? I guess? Would we want to watch two movies about it? No thanks. The Heir was okay, but I wanted what I think all readers wanted: The same premise with a different cast. Hasn't Cass seen The Bachelor? I assumed she had due to the parallels between the first trilogy and the show, but now I'm thinking not. When you make a formula that works and then extend the idea to a new generation, you know what your readers want: dates, scandal, actual villains, people who are actually interested in dating the protagonist? Cass should've viewed some cycles of Degrassi before this undertaking, especially to study how actually teenagers acted.I thought America and Maxon (and the other contestants of the trilogy) were really believable with their idealistic and conflicting emotions, but Eadlyn never did it for me. Cass obviously tried to straddle the line between making her protagonist an actual bitch and making her a typical heroine who has some things to work through, but easily sheds her unappealing qualities by the end (how magical that can happen in less than a year!). In contrast, most of the men were pretty interesting. Kile and Hale had goals, Fox and Gunner had intrigue (though we hardly got to read about them), Henry was endearing, Erik had skills, and Ean was the best and didn't get enough airtime. Yet, they 1. aren't that interested in her at all and 2. leave willingly without Eadlyn having to deal with the consequences. All of these men happily see that they aren't the one for her or conveniently leave without confrontation, which is so unrealistic. In this situation, if you make it to the end, you'd at least have some emotions invested. Eadlyn has virtually no feelings for any of them and her forced \"realization\" of loving Erik after many of his obvious downcast glances when he was around her is both dramatic and silly. Suddenly, she can't live without him but prepares herself to be a martyr when no one explicitly tells her she has to. In fact, most of Eadlyn's issues come from her own high standards for herself rather than those of the people around her who accept and love her. Poor little rich girl, much?The plot was tedious and took away too much from what this story should have been: A reality dating show. Instead, we get the odd insertion of Marid (yet another idiotic name) who really doesn't do much at all and has no point (couldn't they have at least killed him?), America and Maxon's PDA all over the palace (why didn't you just write a book about their marriage? I wouldn't have read it, but still...), America's heart defect (seriously? A totally forced choice to spare this book from being a trilogy too (which I am thankful for)), and Josie's redemption (I promise we didn't care). By the end, I was jubilant that it finished with two books instead of three, but I really didn't care about any of it. The only aspects I did like:The mini homosexual love story (which there should've been more of)Henri's character (although my heart broke for him and how he was used. Luckily, again, he was happy to bow out. How convenient, Cass. We couldn't have anyone being actually hurt and disliking the protagonist you sacrificed quality writing to make us like, could we?)"},

I tried to remember who Kile was...who Erik was...who Ean was...I was totally lost until 1/3 of the way through. So maybe that added to the rushed feeling at the end. At least in the Selection series (the core books), the love between Maxton and America didn't feel like insta-love. This felt totally like insta-love, and I normally don't find that in most books. I know many people feel a lot of books have it, but this relationship between (leave character out to avoid spoilers) seemed to just come out of nowhere and didn't really develop until almost 75% of the way through. It truly seemed like it would be (insert other name here...you'll know who you'd think it was gonna be if you read the first book), but of course, that was all misdirection.I don't know: it wasn't bad. It was cute. I expected more from Cass ever since I read The Siren and immediately loved it. Maybe The Heir and The Crown could've been just one big book? I mean, this book was only 278 pages...it could've handled being longer.I did like the ending. I did like the growth of the originally spoiled and unlikable Eadlyn. (How the hell do you pronounce her name anyway? It is ee-dlyn or Aye-dlyn or Ah-dlyn? Or \"a\" (like in weigh) -dlyn?) That frustrated the heck out of me. But be that as it may...I've never read the novellas in the series because I'm not really a novella reader. But I don't think that would've been relevant to this group of books. Oh, and another thing: they add an adversary halfway through the book! Shouldn't he have been introduced much earlier on, with a little more backstory and foundation? It was just like: problem presented, problem solved. Didn't like that move.Still I give the book U+2605 U+2605 U+2605 U+2605 U+2606. I know I sound like I'm bashing it, but I just didn't connect to the protagonist. Although I will admit that I was never a fan of America from the original Selection books. Kind of bitchy (then become noble) characters.If you're going to read a Kiera Cass novel, I'd recommend The Siren because that story was beautiful and haunting. I heard these books will be made into movies. I do enjoy Cass's writing style and flow. A quick read for all already familiar with the series.I can't wait to see what she has in store for us next."},

And seeing the old couples, aw, I really love them.Now with the romance part, there was a lot of emotions to be dealt with. I felt like I've been toyed, charged, rejected and such. It's confusing and a bit frustrating as hell because I don't know. I like Kile, Henri, Eikko and Hale (who turned out to be gay which is not that surprising and I still like him for it). To be honest, I'm really rooting for Kile that's why I felt rejected when Eadlyn decided to settle down with him but end up banishing him instead from the palace. It makes me utterly sad.

I'm glad that worked out though. I'm also glad that Kile got to do as he pleased and travel the country and help people. I do think that with this selection, being from the selectors POV, there was more closure for all of the characters we come to know. For further example, I love hoe Hale is going to design the wedding dress and Henri, bake the cake... I do love Henri.I'm really glad that we got to see a better side to Josie in this as well.The Lady Brice thing was so unexpected and actually a really good plot twist in my opinion.Overall, this book, for me, was the least enjoyable out of the 5 selection books and I was not satisfied with the ending so I gave this a 3/5 stars."},

She's the only character I loved who was developped enough. She grow up, she opened her heart, her evolution was interesting. As for the plot, it was superficial and inconsistant. Kiera Cass had good ideas but she never developped them. It's sad because I always though this series had so much potential for a good romance and a good political game. But The Selection is just a cute series with love and nothing more really. It was nice to read it.[Chronique en franU+00E7ais]Je n'ai jamais eu de grandes attentes pour cette saga que j'ai toujours trouvU+00E9e superficielle et peu dU+00E9veloppU+00E9e.

It was brutal to even continue reading the damn book after the -ahem- 'goodbye' scene with a certain someone and rather abrupt stereotypical happily ever after ending with a completely out-of-nowhere prince charming. It honestly destroyed me because I felt as if 'The Heir' was definitely heading towards someone but then the second-half of 'The Crown' randomly shifted to someone else. I feel as if Kiera had originally planned for Eadlyn to choose who most people were rooting for but then changed her mind and opted to make the ending of Eadlyn's story less predictable than America's. Ofcourse America's story was predictable, especially in the last book but I don't think many people minded because more than half the fandom WANTED it to happen. I feel as if Kiera wanted to change this whole 'predictable' thing and decided to change it up. I hate that. In conclusion, I'm most likely never going to read it again and am so upset. "},

But she chose him and there was no buildup and it came out of nowhere and I was upset.Maybe if she was going to choose him, make him more of an important character throughout? They had a good friendship going but seriously I don't understand why she chose to marry him. After so much waiting, I despised this book. The writing felt rushed. The pace was SLOW.

That whole \"let's make her wanted,let's make some drama\" shit really annoyed me thought. I must say that even if I may not like the person she ended up with or the unnecessary drama in the book, I understand and agree with her reasons."},
