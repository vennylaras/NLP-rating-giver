"He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype ",?
"However when Warner Bros ",?

"The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school ",?
"BlasphemyJust kidding ",?
"This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it ",?
"I was just kidding ",?
"To be frank I tried hard not to like this ",?
"I thought that giving this a or will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are up to now ignoring this book ",?
"I told you so",?
"Why waste your time",?

"When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books I couldnUt have been happier ",?
"As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang and I realized that IUd never done more than a perfunctory revieOn my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me Number is that they gave me at years old the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series ",?

"As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang and I realized that IUd never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume ",?
"I figured it was high time to rectify that oversightHarry deserves it ",?
"However with over a million ratings and almost two reviews for every day IUve been alive I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles ",?
"It has all been eloquently said before ",?
"Therefore I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people ",?
"Here goesOnly rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings ",?
"One that can hold at bay even if only for precious moments the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life ",?
"These stories do that ",?
"ItUs an escape into a world of optimism honor and hope where things always look hopeful and anything is possible ",?
"Who wouldnt want to hang around in a place like that especially when it is decorated with sorting hats kindly giants magic wands and QuidditchGrantedno aspect of the story is revolutionary or even particularly noteworthy from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre ",?
"It isnUt great literature and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success ",?
"Fineacknowledged ",?
"And",?
"So whatThe virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers ",?
"HarryUs story is something that radiates acceptance inclusion and friendship ",?
"It invokes a sense of belonging ",?
"Inside these pages you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanityUs nature and feel just a little better about the world around youHow is that not worthy of praiseAs for Harry himself heUs just a good kid ",?
"The quintessential everyman who makes good ",?
"A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him ",?
"HeUs someone you canUt help but like ",?
"HeUs not perfect ",?
"He makes mistakes heUs occasionally short sighted and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more ",?
"Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas ",?
"But thatUs not Harry ",?
"HeUs a better person than that ",?
"ThatUs why we love him ",?
"Maybe all of the above is a bit much ",?
"Like I said I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me ",?
"LetUs just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy ",?
"IUll certainly settle for that ",?
"As for the rating I Initially only gave this first volume stars and IUm not going to change that now ",?
"As much as I love the series as a whole I donUt think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ",?
"Still this is where it all began ",?
"As such it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better stars ",?
"Highly Recommended ",?
"Yes Ive been living under a rock ",?

"I also find it stupid of me how I just recently decided to check this out and finally read it ",?
"But still I guess I can still write a review ",?
"Of course my thoughts would be quite similar to everyone else ",?
"Thoughts and opinions nothing negative maybe maybe not ",?
"But here goes nothingHarry Potter is one of the most famous loved and top series out there ",?
"It is loved adored cherished and amazing for HP fans every time they read it ",?
"No matter how many times it is read it fills the persons heart with warmth and happiness as they are going back to the wizarding world ",?
"As for me I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this because I am new to this allOther than that Harry Potter is considered a Childrens book but in my opinion its in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some ",?
"Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names ",?
"Harry Potter a story about a young wizard that didnt even know he was a wizard ",?
"Harry Potter a yearold boy who turned is living with his horrible rude and awful family The Dursleys ",?
"Mrs Dursley is known as Harry Potters mothers sister ",?
"The problem is they didnt like each other nor blend in with each other ",?
"They were different ",?
"Her sister was a witch while she was just a Muggle a person who cannot seek the magic and find it nothing and no one special because they arent able to turn things into other things arent able to fly on a broom cast a robe on fire defeat a villain confuse a troll arent able to do anything really ",?
"Well she wasnt besides treat Harry with such disrespect and treat her ugly and fat son with such caress and would spoil him because he was such a little brat that would get what he wants ",?
"Really though ",?
"There would be presents under a Christmas tree and as he counts them he pouts and is upset because its less than what he had the year before ",?
"DUDE I BARELY GET A BARNES AND NOBLE GIFT CARD CHILLThe reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ",?
"When Harry was a baby his parents were killed by EveryoneKnowsWho but as he tried killing Harry he really wasnt able to ",?
"His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him but as he tried killing Harry he couldnt bare to do it and left him a scar the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person ",?
"Once saved and taken the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys and as Harry grows they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies ",?
"Except they dontAs days pass Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesnt know ",?
"He doesnt know who it is and what they want but he knows there is something going on due to the amount of letters being sent ",?
"After getting the chance to open the first one his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him read it and burn it ",?
"He knows he knows who it is and what they want but he doesnt want Harry to know ",?
"But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all letters keep arriving and arriving until the person finally shows up facetoface with The Dursleys and Harry on his th birthdayHes huge introduced as a halfgiant and halfhuman known as Rubeus Hagrid ",?
"Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth telling him he is a wizard and a wellknown one as well ",?
"Hes got talent and has some of the same abilities as his parents ",?
"One being a witch and the other being a wizard Harry is known as a wizard as well ",?
"And as Hagrid tells him the truth Harry does too ",?
"He doesnt know what he is talking about and doesnt know what is going on ",?
"He doesnt believe he is a wizard and doesnt believe the reason for his parents deaths ",?
"But of course Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash for that seemed impossible but they were killed by EveryoneKnowsWho and is the reason for his scarHis aunt finally admitting herself into being a witness of knowing the truth got everything out of her chest and was able to tell him the truth ",?
"She wouldnt even mention her sister because she pretended to not have one ",?
"She was considered perfect and brave while she was nothing and unnoticed ",?
"Nothing has changed but she didnt even bother trying to care care of her niece as her sister is dead protecting Harry from wherever she is ",?
"And as Hagrid tells Harry the rest he actually takes Harry with him even when Mr Dursley forbids him He cant do anything since he is a Muggle and Harry has already been accepted to Hogwarts School and nothing can change ",?
"When Harry leaves with Hagrid they go and buy him what he needs including clothes and supplies for the school ",?
"As they go to the shop he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else ",?
"Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand ",?
"Hes famous his name is everywhere and he can be considered a legend for what happened ",?
"But even with all this going on Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out ",?
"As Harry and Hagrid get what they need its time for Harry to go to school where he meets Ron Weasley as to what I know one of his best friends ",?
"Ron is small redhaired has freckles pale and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him ",?
"Hes not accepted into the other groups and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend ",?
"Harry also meets Hermione Granger known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be ",?
"Of course they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school so I was just like we get it Days pass and Harry is being trained ",?
"Hes a neutral to broomstick flying is able to play Quidditch the most popular game in Hogwarts is given special supplies and is of course known by everyone ",?
"Other than that Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths but in order to do that he must find a way to find them and figure them out ",?
"With the help of his two friends he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard more about his parents history about himself who this YouKnowWho person is remember his past and see how his life really will be changed forever ",?
"Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for themHarry Potter was easy to read understand and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it stars ",?
"Now I hate myself once again and ask myself again Why the fuck did I not read this earlier The answer is obvious because I already know it and its because I was never a fan of it ",?
"I hate speaking about my past but this is one ugly past and I hate it ",?
"I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it ",?
"But soon Ill get over it and will be able to reread this as many times as I will be able to during my last years of being a teen ",?
"Yes a yearold that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young ",?
"PATHETICThe fantasy is cute I will say ",?
"Its easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through ",?
"Its not long its not hard and its not boring ",?
"Its gripping fun and everything is filled with some kind of magical that has me turning page by page ",?
"Having no regrets anywhere I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards where students learn how to make potions talk to ghosts learn about other creatures transform things into other things read minds become invisible fly in the air with a broomstick play soccer in the air have a feast and enjoy it all learn magic have a wand and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses ",?
"Well I guess in mostEverything was fun to read ",?
"I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life ",?
"He was confused but he found out a lot more ",?
"Theres still more but I know that as he grows I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how ",?
"Ill see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness ",?
"Ill be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes ",?
"I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think ",?
"I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger ",?
"I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy ",?
"But more importantly I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like Im on an adventure ",?
"Reading it for the first time feels like one ",?
"Ive never watched the films ",?
"Ive watched parts but skipped them ",?
"Now I wont skip anything ",?
"Its like an adventure where Im dived in and cant seem to leave because Im so alive and intriguedWhat can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said",?
"Nothing ",?
"Reviews are always similar and this one might be too ",?
"Everyone loves it and so did I So will I I should say ",?
" Yes I had trouble pronouncing some names at first but got used to it after ",?
"Yes I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed ",?
"But nothing was boring and even when I rolled my eyes there was a reason for that eye rolling scene ",?
"Maybe it was Hermione being annoying or Draco being a rude boy mocking an adorable redhaired ",?
"Or both ",?
"But I was also laughing ",?
"I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid ",?
"Since the beginning I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious ",?
"I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig ",?
"I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly but thats okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times ",?
"Oh and also Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys I love him ",?
"Hes so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry ",?
"I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry ",?
"He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as bring him a present and giving him another one at the end ",?
"Ron is honestly the cutest ",?
"I dont understand how anyone could be mean to him ",?
"He may be weak but he has his own strengths ",?
"Hes so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him ",?
"There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it but Ill probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know hes still gonna be really mean throughout the series ",?
"Im sure ",?
"I havent spoiled myself so I have no idea how his or anyone elses life goes but I do know that he changes in some way ",?
"Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy ",?
"She hated losing points for her house and because she Ron and Harry were in the same house they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor ",?
"She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with herMalfoy Draco was someone I did not like at all ",?
"Like I said he mocked and made fun of Ron and I hated him for it ",?
"He showed off as well but in the bad way thinking he was really cool just because hes in Slytherin and how used to the wizarding world he is ",?
"He didnt show much care about Harry and his past and would try to get in a fight with Harry while Harry tried fixing the problem ",?
"He payed no attention and took it too far with Harry ",?
"He was a newbie as well so I dont see what the point was ",?
"But the other point is that I dont have expectations for Draco but I hope I dont end up hating him in all books and hope there is some change at least slightly goodThe friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites ",?
"I know it didnt work out at first and they honestly hated her but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle ",?
"Thanks to the troll she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them ",?
"She didnt yell at them for fighting the troll but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again ",?
"As it was ending she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldnt really figure out what to say ",?
"But also my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning ",?
"It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends and it just made me happy seeing them all together same house same team same classes ",?
"The writing of course is like I said easy to understand ",?
"There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded and there were no problems ",?
"I didnt know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences ",?
"I hear they are kind of the same just that the book provides some more information and detail ",?
"Like always its no surprise ",?
"There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of themOverall I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with now wanting the nd and the rd and the rest ",?
"Really excited to see where this all goes to and how Harry becomes a better wizard ",?
"As wonderful and magical as promised ",?
"Because I didnt remember the movie the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to meI wish Id had this book when I was a kid because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to meAnnes finishing this too and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book As wonderful and magical as promised ",?
