I'm going to keep this brief since there isn't much to say that hasn't already been said .,
*clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn't imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry .,
I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste .,
I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this .,

It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls  .,
.,
and probably much more that I'm forgetting .,
And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero .,
Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent .,
What's not to love?,
In regards to the ending: (view spoiler)[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit!,
If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them .,

There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to start Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.*******************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets[I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn't suspect Quirrell a bit!,

This is a disgrace to all pure bloods .,
My head looked quite dashing on that strange professor's head .,
If only I could have extended my stay .,
Harry Potter .,
This is not over yet .,
Why the heck did I not read Harry Potter before now..its flipping magical (literally)!,

Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's "New Releases" shelf .,
Harry Potter, books 1 through 3 .,
She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel .,
She had read the Outlander series earlier that year, after all .,
And it had sex in it .,
SEX!,
She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them .,
Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter .,
Harry Potter is 11 .,
Khanh is 14 .,
There is a vast difference in their ages .,
Khanh was a teenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new .,
Brand new .,
They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader .,
And Khanh was tempted.She picked up the first book in the series: Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.The end.Or rather, the beginning .,
My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight .,
However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable .,
Honestly, its not even worth discussing .,
Its not just that Twilight doesn't come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works .,
Its peerless .,

To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It "ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport." There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review .,
It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years .,
It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have .,
Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me .,
Eternal, this is the one that started it all .,
Original review (circa 2010) A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate: Go ahed, tell me Twilight is better .,
Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort, That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly's That Edward is cooler than Harry, and Bella is smarter than Hermione .,
Tell me that Stephenie Meyer is more talented than J.K. Rowling .,
Go ahead, I dare you .,
Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over, are utterly stupid .,
Quite frankly-this book is amazing .,
Update September 2016: Currently rereading this series again!,
(I need to sort out my priorities.)I will never ever rate this lower than 5 stars .,
BEAUTIFUL .,
There are no words to do this book justice .,

So THAT'S worth something.mmmm, this book smells so good .,
It's good to be back .,
How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this?I have to get this right .,
As of this writing, I have 98 Goodreads friends .,
61 (62%) of them have read J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .,
Out of those who read this, 39 (64%) rated this with 5 stars .,
11 of them with 4 stars .,
All the others gave 3 or 2 .,
Only 2 rated this with 1 star .,
One of them admitted not being able to finish it .,
She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety .,

Only 2 rated this with 1 star .,
One of them admitted not being able to finish it .,
She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety .,
(But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside .,
I read only those books that my brother told me to read .,
He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype .,
However, when Warner Bros .,
released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date .,
I was wrong .,
She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed .,
We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it: I will never read Harry Potter.My daughter is now 15 going 16 .,
She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter .,
However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books .,
Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read .,
So the following day, I bought my copy.After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it?,
Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars?,
Most of them did not bother writing a review .,
Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet .,
But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long.These are what some of them say: it was a great book i enjoyed reading it For an eloquent reviewer, she must have been too happy to express herself .,
Such a great story and creative way of writing .,
I love Harry Potter .,
Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative .,
I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too!,
It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter .,
Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book .,
I enjoyed reading it Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads .,
I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though .,
Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards .,
Another one of my favorite reviewers .,
That seems to have nailed this .,
Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery .,
That should be it!,
The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work .,
The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school .,
Blasphemy.Just kidding .,
This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it .,
I was just kidding .,
To be frank, I tried hard not to like this .,
I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book .,
I told you so!,
Why waste your time?,
.,
However, unless you are a grumpy old man/woman, there is nothing not to like about this book .,
I maybe too old for it but hey, talent is talent and J. K. Rowling has it!My 39 friends are indeed right!,
On my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me, Number 14,577 is that they gave me, at 41 years old, the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series .,
When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldnU+2019t have been happier .,

When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldnU+2019t have been happier .,
As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that IU+2019d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume .,
I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.Harry deserves it .,
However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day IU+2019ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles .,
It has all been eloquently said before .,
Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people .,
Here goes..Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings .,
One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life .,
These stories do that .,
ItU+2019s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible .,
Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.Granted..no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre .,
It isnU+2019t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success .,
Fine..acknowledged .,
And?,
So what!The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers .,
HarryU+2019s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship .,
It invokes a sense of belonging .,
Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanityU+2019s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.How is that not worthy of praise?As for Harry himself, heU+2019s just a good kid .,
The quintessential everyman who makes good .,
A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him .,
HeU+2019s someone you canU+2019t help but like .,
HeU+2019s not perfect .,
He makes mistakes, heU+2019s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more .,
Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas .,
But thatU+2019s not Harry .,
HeU+2019s a better person than that .,
ThatU+2019s why we love him .,
Maybe all of the above is a bit much .,
Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me .,
LetU+2019s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy .,
IU+2019ll certainly settle for that .,
As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and IU+2019m not going to change that now .,
As much as I love the series as a whole, I donU+2019t think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire .,
Still, this is where it all began .,
As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.3.0 stars .,
Highly Recommended .,
Yes, I've been living under a rock .,

It'd be limited for religious or some educating books, classic and small novels., even these kinds of books goes just electronicU+2026 .,
and the books be just like an old Video Tape.A Dystopia ,right?,
very gloomy idea to the world without This novel, The One.Well, in the case you think I'm exaggerate.Let's haveA Brief !!!,
History of Literature in the 90s------------------------------------------Well, letU+2019s back to the early 90s , where TV is in every house,even in every room ,Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere and satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast, with many channels for kids and teenagers making them attached more and more into screens, not to mention Video Games, Game boy and NintendoU+2026 Those from this new generation who read are U+201Cweirdos" or "nerdsU+201D to the rest of their peers.And for those U+201Cfew who readU+201D book stores mostly got for them just comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.The classic novels they read just for schools and education, otherwise they merely know the movies that based on.The new novels that make a best seller are the ones which made ,or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity , or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these novels didn't live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie -whatU+2019s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?- also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy , no more Hugo in France.Also in Egypt no more like Naguib Mahfouz and the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new big hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange and mysterious things in the world or in religion,Dreams explications , cocking books or just celebrities rumors.While in US and UK it selling books mostly the self help books, or those which teach how to make Computers programs or even web sites -this brand new huge technology leap back then.No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, just some few successful highlights like R.L.StineU+2019s Goosepumbs in 1992 which make a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt thereU+2019s also a very successful project made by The Modern Arabic Institution for Publishing & Distribution which made U+201CPocket NovelsU+201D for youth , by brilliant Egyptian writers,who presented excellent variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.ThereU+2019s also U+201CReading for AllU+201D,project by the first lady U+201CSusan MubarakU+201D which printed a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn't attract U+201Cmore and moreU+201D of new youth readers ,it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who donU+2019t just read will increase if there isn't a big new attractive reading experience to get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in 1994and became a real phenomenon by 1995..itU+2019s the Playstation , the giant Japanese gaming leap.Football, Crash , Pepsi man, and the comics heroes also have their games , so why reading Superman , BatmanU+2019s comics when you can play them..**************************************************************************************************So by 1996,with this growing leap in Gaming, as also the Computer 3D games getting even much improves, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think itU+2019s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may even cover itU+2019s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, when Joanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript for her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it..A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel, that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it, and for children- Seriously is there still any who still read?,
itU+2019s 1996, the era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest U+201CBloomsburyU+201C agreed to publish it ,with 2 advises for her, first that sheU+2019d get a day job, since itU+2019s a little chance of making money in children's books .,
- later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman.so with her name and her grandmotherU+2019s "Kathleen" come the 2 initial of her pen nameU+2026J  .,

Rowling And in 26th June 1997 ,with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries.come out in UK, to our world The Greatest Harry Potter and the Philosopher's StoneAnd Baam , everything happened so fast.Before the end of this year the novel awarded many important litural awards in the UK, an American important publisher , Scholastic , won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, The title changes from Philosopher's Stone to the Sorcerer's Stone , as the American publisher saw that Philosopher's may not be that attractive to young readers.And Thanks to Harry Potter ,now Every young readers know much more about Philosopher's Stone from their other reads.In 1998 Book 2 released in UK ,1999 in US, winning more literary prizes .,

And on 8 July 1999, The First Breaking Record made when Book 3 sold 68.000 copies in just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.and more copies when it released late 1999 in US.With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers , more records had been broken both in UK and US. .,
The 3 books takeover the top spot in the charts of best selling books for weeks and months, and it was still the hardcover editions.This conquer made some literary magazines and newspapers separate the Harry Potter books selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting its lists into children Books and adult books sections under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking .,
And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change . .,
forever.The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games.But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the midnight of 8 July 2000 in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not electronic stores or Apple stores -as theses days- , it was Bookstores, for may be the first time in the Book Stores History , to buy a copy of . .,

And huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director..and it also made some records , but that's not our subject now .,
************************************************************************************By the announcement of pushing the publishing date of book 5 to mid 2003 , and even by 2 movies out so far, the hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on .,
Also , as more readers start to increase into this generation, Publishers and book stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more.Older fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings -which was a super successful movie by then too- Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels which finally getting more reprinted editions..and so Book stores to get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon .,

The funny thing that there's a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is the second most selling book in history after the Bible.., a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that .,
A month later,May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel -do you think publishers would agree if there's no Harry Potter before?,
,He'd may be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)- , The Kate Runner which also made a very good records too.And that's didn't affect the main reason for this new 'literal renaissance'.All that didn't affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later.On 20 June 2003 book 5 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' comes out , ten thousands of all ages conquer the book stores in UK, US and other countries too to get the one they been waiting for at least 2 years. .,

A huge book, may didn't fans' expectations of being full of action , but it get a twist that blow minds about one of the most interesting characters, Professor Snape.That made many fans and even big authors like Stephen King and Salman Rushdie talk about for months.****************The pre-final book followed by a massive variety of new novels, new authors..Twilight series, Percy Jackson series, and more new novels, more books sales not only in US, UK but worldwide..But still Potter is the Records Big Breaker. .,
At the midnight before 21 June 2007, everywhere around the globe the scene of thousands of people lining in front of book stores was repeated..even bigger than any time before .,

more writers come with more books and novels, some are just a rip off others and some are really original and brilliant .,

Here are three reasons why Harry Potter rocks my socks:1.A Better WorldOne of the main reasons Harry Potter is so wonderful is because Rowling shows you a boring world; it is the world of reality, dry, boring and ordinary .,
Then under it she reveals fantasy; she reveals everything a reader longs for: she reveals pure escapism .,

I always will .,

WeU+2019re all a bit like HarryOkay so not many of us are orphans, and not many of us are practically abused in their own homes, but a lot of us feel isolated in the world, a lot of us wish for a fantastic group of friends as a child .,
I know I did, and this again leads back to my first point .,
Not everyone finds a Ron and Hermione.3 .,
The magicSeems a bit of an obvious point doesnU+2019t it?,
But, seriously, not many books have such a well-developed system .,
We have different categories, spell names, potions and books, lots of books on magic .,
And who doesnU+2019t like books on magic?,
This boy will be famous .,
There won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name .,
Everyone grew up with Harry Potter .,
They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films .,
They would re-watch and re-read them .,
They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione .,
They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP U+275DThis boy will be famous .,

They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world .,
Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.Except me .,
I didn't grow up with Harry Potter .,
Not because I didn't get to, but because I chose not to .,
I know, it's like living a life where everything has been a lie .,
Worse even .,
It's just, the movies would appear on my tv .,
From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn't be interested and would skip it when I came to it .,
I wouldn't bother and wouldn't care, and that made a big problem in my life now .,
Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now .,
But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films .,
Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much .,
I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become .,
There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.I find it stupid of me to write a review for Harry Potter, especially being the first one .,
I also find it stupid of me how I just recently decided to check this out and finally read it .,
But still, I guess I can still write a review .,
Of course, my thoughts would be quite similar to everyone else .,
Thoughts and opinions, nothing negative, maybe, maybe not .,
But, here goes nothing.Harry Potter is one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there .,
It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it .,
No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person's heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world .,
As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children's book but in my opinion, it's in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some .,
Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names .,
Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn't even know he was a wizard .,
Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful "family", The Dursleys .,
Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter's mother's sister .,
The problem is, they didn't like each other, nor blend in with each other .,
They were different .,
Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren't able to turn things into other things, aren't able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren't able to do anything, really .,
Well, she wasn't, besides treat Harry with such disrespect and treat her ugly and fat son with such caress and would spoil him because he was such a little brat that would get what he wants .,
Really though .,
There would be 36 presents under a Christmas tree and as he counts them, he pouts and is upset because it's less than what he had the year before .,
DUDE I BARELY GET A BARNES AND NOBLE GIFT CARD CHILL!The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess, is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .,
When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn't able to .,
His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn't bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person .,
Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies .,
Except they don't.As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn't know .,
He doesn't know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent .,
After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it .,
He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn't want Harry to know .,
But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.He's huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid .,
Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well .,
He's got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents .,
One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well .,
And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too .,
He doesn't know what he is talking about and doesn't know what is going on .,
He doesn't believe he is a wizard, and doesn't believe the reason for his parent's deaths .,
But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.His aunt, finally admitting herself into being a witness of knowing the truth, got everything out of her chest and was able to tell him the truth .,
She wouldn't even mention her sister, because she pretended to not have one .,
She was considered perfect and brave, while she was nothing and unnoticed .,
Nothing has changed, but she didn't even bother trying to care care of her niece as her sister is dead, protecting Harry from wherever she is .,
And as Hagrid tells Harry the rest, he actually takes Harry with him even when Mr. Dursley "forbids him." He can't do anything, since he is a Muggle and Harry has already been accepted to Hogwarts School and nothing can change .,
When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school .,
As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else .,
Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand .,
He's famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened .,
But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out .,
As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it's time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends .,
Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him .,
He's not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend .,
Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be .,
Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like "we get it." Days pass, and Harry is being trained .,
He's a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone .,
Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out .,
With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this "You-Know-Who" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever .,
Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.Harry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars .,
Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, "Why the fuck did I not read this earlier?" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it's because I was never a fan of it .,
I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it .,
I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it .,
But soon I'll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen .,
Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young .,
PATHETIC.The fantasy is cute, I will say .,
It's easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through .,
It's not long, it's not hard, and it's not boring .,
It's gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical that has me turning page by page .,
Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses .,
Well, I guess in most.Everything was fun to read .,
I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life .,
He was confused, but he found out a lot more .,
There's still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how .,
I'll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness' .,
I'll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes .,
I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think .,
I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger .,
I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy .,
But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I'm on an adventure .,
Reading it for the first time feels like one .,
I've never watched the films .,
I've watched parts, but skipped them .,
Now, I won't skip anything .,
It's like an adventure where I'm dived in and can't seem to leave because I'm so alive and intrigued.What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said?,
Nothing .,
Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too .,
Everyone loves it, and so did I. So will I, I should say .,
, Yes, I had trouble pronouncing some names at first but got used to it after .,
Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed .,
But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene .,
Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired .,
Or both .,
But I was also laughing .,
I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid .,
Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious .,
I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig .,
I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that's okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times .,
Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him .,
He's so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry .,
I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry .,
He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end .,
Ron is honestly the cutest .,
I don't understand how anyone could be mean to him .,
He may be weak, but he has his own strengths .,
He's so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him .,
There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I'll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he's still gonna be really mean throughout the series .,
I'm sure .,
I haven't spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else's life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way .,
Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy .,
She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor .,
She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.Malfoy Draco was someone I did not like, at all .,
Like I said, he mocked and made fun of Ron and I hated him for it .,
He showed off as well but in the bad way, thinking he was really cool just because he's in Slytherin and how used to the wizarding world he is .,
He didn't show much care about Harry and his past, and would try to get in a fight with Harry while Harry tried fixing the problem .,
He payed no attention and took it too far with Harry .,
He was a newbie as well, so I don't see what the point was .,
But the other point is that I don't have expectations for Draco but I hope I don't end up hating him in all books and hope there is some change, at least slightly good.The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites .,
I know it didn't work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle .,
Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them .,
She didn't yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again .,
As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn't really figure out what to say .,
But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning .,
It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes .,
The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand .,
There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems .,
I didn't know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences .,
I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail .,
Like always, it's no surprise .,
There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.Overall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest .,
Really excited to see where this all goes to, and how Harry becomes a better wizard .,
As wonderful and magical as promised .,
Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ..As wonderful and magical as promised .,

I found that I very much enjoyed the American audiobooks with Jim Dale narrating, however, so I read the first few books this way .,
But this came to an end when I misplaced the fourth book and no longer had a long commute--I never did reach the end of that wretchedly long quidditch game, so I gave up .,

But here it is, 2015 and I'm trying again!,
This time I'm doing the wonderful Stephen Fry narration on audio .,
It's interesting to come into these books after all this history, both in the sense of the cultural impact of these stories as well as the knowledge of how much children's lit, as art and as industry, has changed for the better because of them .,
Re-read reaction: 3.5 starsWith this first book (and I suspect with the next few), I still feel the way I did before .,
I admire the incredibly imaginative ideas so much, but the writing isn't quite as rich or the character development isn't quite as deep/emotional as I'd like just yet .,
It's a pretty straightforward story, albeit one embellished with fantastic details .,
But I LOVE HERMIONE GRANGER, always have, and I've heard the later books are much darker .,
And it's still a lovely experience to have the books read to me like a bedtime story .,
My favorite parts of this book: The mirror of Erised, owl post (pleeease may I have an owl), and the thing hidden under the turban .,
And: It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.Well done, Neville .,
You deserved the same number of house points as the other children, in my book .,
This doesn't really need a review, does it?This series is brilliant and it will live on forever in our hearts and minds .,
Can 35 Million Book Buyers Be Wrong?,
Yes.Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles .,
By opposing the sea, you won't end it .,
The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review .,

The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review .,
Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list .,
J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.Imaginative VisionI read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now .,
I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," purportedly the best of the lot .,
Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability .,
It is much better to see the movie, "The Wizard of Oz," than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision .,
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success .,
Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.The ultimate model for Harry Potter is "Tom Brown's School Days" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857 .,
The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet .,
But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy .,
Rowling has taken "Tom Brown's School Days" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein .,
The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of "Harry Potter." But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's "The Wind in the Willows" or the "Alice" books of Lewis Carroll .,
Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all?,
Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the "perfectly normal" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery .,
The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught .,
Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf .,
The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations .,

They're amazing, wonderful, fantastic, addicting, SUPERLATIVE--Self: *nods emphatic agreement*So what's the deal people?Boiled down to its most basic s, HARRY POTTER AND THE SORCERER'S STONE is urban fantasy .,
For kids?,
Absolutely.For adults?,
ALSO absolutely.Rowling creates a wondrous world of magic that exists alongside the normal, the "muggle" world.In this magic world, the objects and PEOPLE in pictures move, chess pieces are both sentient and opinionated about your game-playing strategy .,
Jelly beans come in EVERY flavor, so part of the fun is never knowing whether the funny yellow one is going to be toffee  .,
.,
or earwax .,
Creatures of legend--centaurs, hippogriffs, dragons, goblins, etc.--are part of everyday life .,
If you're a wizard.But all of the world-building is secondary to Harry himself .,
The boy who lived.Harry was only a year old when he was given over to his only living relatives .,
The Dursleys of 4 Privot Drive are happy in their normalcy, their mediocrity .,
They think things properly account for the worth of a person, they indulge their already horrible son, and they more than neglect Harry  .,
.,
They're dismissive of him .,
They humiliate him .,
They stifle him .,
And they do all of these things thoughtlessly .,
As if he's not a real person  .,
.,
B/c he's other.Their abuse is so offhand, you have to be an adult, or least a mature reader to recognize it for what it is .,
Younger readers just see a hateful villain .,
A hateful villain who does such ostentatiously self-centered things to poor Harry that they can alternately "Yayyyyyy," and "Booooooo," with enthusiasm .,
I've heard similar comparisons made about Robin Williams' Genie in Disney's Aladdin--the character was complex enough for adults to enjoy while being thoroughly entertaining to children.So that's my sale .,
Harry Potter isn't just for children, it's for EVERYONE .,
In my humble opinion, what Rowling has done with these books makes Disney's Genie look like amateur hour (and I quite like Aladdin .,
FYI).And as the recent popularity of coloring books for adults has proven, people of all ages like pretty things, and that is why this new illustrated version is spectacular:SO .,
We have an engaging premise: a child mysteriously defeats the most powerful dark wizard in memory, becoming instantly famous in one world, a world full of wonder and magic, is raised ignorant of his past by negligent relatives, only to be reintroduced to the magical world when he comes of age to attend the equivalent of middle school.We have the earlier referenced fantastical world-building .,
We have well-developed, often hilarious or reprehensible characters (depending on whether they're meant to be Good or Bad) .,
And we have addictive individual story plots that build into the best Good vs .,
Evil story arc since LOTR .,
And children LOVE it .,
So will you .,

And WOW!,
Just WOW!,

-- exactly what I've felt the first time I've read this.Harry Potter is such a great, well-fleshed out character .,
Despite being parentless and being bullied both in the Muggle world and Hogwarts by some kids, he still stood up and even became a great friend to Ron, Hermione, Neville, and the others .,
This story had lots of exciting adventures and I really enjoyed everything that happened in this book .,
It was just so awesome!,
The secondary characters are also perfect .,
I especially love Hermione and her genius mind!,
Ron's loyalty towards Harry is also awe-inspiring, as well as Neville's adorable clumsiness .,
When it comes to its plotline, it's amazingly done .,
The twist was unpredictable and there was humor in every page that made me laugh .,
What's even great are the lessons and the message that are instilled to every reader, fantasy and magic aside .,
"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends." I loved all the chapters and my favorites are:The Boy Who Lived, The Vanishing Glass, Diagon Alley, The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, The Sorting Hat, and Quidditch.No wonder why this book and the whole series continues to be a real sensation .,
J.K. Rowling is so brilliant she bewitched me with her world!,
So excited to find out more about this series and to see what's in store for Harry in the next books .,
:)Rating:  .,
Obviously 5/5 stars, especially because DANG the illustrations in this are on point .,
They were breathtaking .,
I can not recommend this illustrated edition enough .,
Even if you've read the book a million times, reading this version is like seeing it with new eyes .,
I absolutely LOVED it .,
I'm 30 years old and I've finally started the Harry Potter series .,
I know what you're thinking- it took me long enough!,
I say better late than never!,
I remember when the first movie was released in 2001 .,
My sister was reading the books and so was my best friend .,
In 2001 I was in high school, and though I loved the movie, I was reading Sylvia Plath and Wally Lamb and had no interest in the young adult genre .,
Now, totally different story!,
I'm all about reading some YA .,

Since I've seen the movies, there wasn't a ton of new material in this book for me (though my I've heard that the further I get into the series, the more new material I'll come across) .,
I enjoyed reading this one lots and I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the magical Harry Potter books this year!,
I have a confession to make .,
***I have never read Harry Potter .,
Yes, yes, I know..this is akin to reader sacrilege.But I just had no interest in these books when they came out .,
I was too busy reading about men in kilts fucking the milkmaid .,
Therefore, my only experience with "Hermione" is the SNL skit where Lindsey Lohan shows Harry and that other scarfed dude her ginormous tatas .,
Well, what with everyone going ape shit over the newest installment, I figure I should probably find out what all tI have a confession to make .,

And since my friend's 9 year old demanded that I read his copy, I now have the paperback in my possession .,
Hoping to get starting this week. .,

I don't think anything I write here hasn't been said already .,
But I've just read the illustrated edition by Jim Kay and if it is possible, it makes this book even more outstanding than it already is .,
Jim Kay is awesome .,
Maybe you have read A Monster Calls and already know him .,
If not, you should definitley reconsider your life choices.I am certainly going to buy an edition of this, it's so pretty I could die .,
Looking forward to the illustrated sequels!1000/5 stars .,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the most celebrated books of all time for one simple reason..because it deserves to be!I'll write a full review when I have time, but for now here's my.."Book, you have the right to a speedy trial" review THE DEFENSE - Rowling's prose is absolutely magical - Story is not only exciting but often sweet as well - Lead characters are all captivating - Comic relief (mostly from Ron) is blended perfectly with the more dramatic events - Never a dull moHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is one of the most celebrated books of all time for one simple reason..because it deserves to be!I'll write a full review when I have time, but for now here's my.."Book, you have the right to a speedy trial" review THE DEFENSE - Rowling's prose is absolutely magical - Story is not only exciting but often sweet as well - Lead characters are all captivating - Comic relief (mostly from Ron) is blended perfectly with the more dramatic events - Never a dull moment THE PROSECUTION - Rowling is occasionally too over-the-top for her own good (especially during Harry's time with the Dursleys) - After reading this, anything else you do may seem like a waste of time that you could have used to read Harry Potter again!,
THE VERDICTSome books are worth reading once, this one is worthy reading many times!,
A brilliant adventure that anyone can enjoy!,
In the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling perfects the most important rule of story telling: be interesting .,
Her prose might not be great (although it is good), her plots and mysteries might be a little convoluted .,
But damn can she tell an interesting story, build a fun world, and put great characters in it.From the first sentence, she lets you know what fun you're in for .,

There's just that magical touch to it only she seems to have .,
And she keeps it going through the whole book (and the six others in the series) without missing a beat.The Sorcerer's Stone is packed with mystery .,
It starts early and picks up speed, burning through pages, right to the reveal, which is quite the surprise--no Scooby-Doo ending here.But the thing that really makes this book stand out is the characters .,
Harry Potter ended up getting on my last nerve in the series, but in this book, he's crazy likable .,
The minor characters are what really make the series, though .,
They have more personality than the protagonist of most books.This series might not be the best, but there's nothing like it .,
It's just magical .,
Plain and simple .,
EDIT NOTE in 2012: Since this apparently isn't obvious, I wrote the review years ago .,
I do not necessarily have those opinions now .,
I wouldn't know; I haven't read Harry Potter since .,
With a degree and five more birthdays behind me I do not necessarily agree with everything I said when I was seventeen years old .,

I'm happy to chat about the definition of literature with you, or what I think about the Harry Potter phenomenon now or whatever, but try and be civil and don't attack me right out of the gate.EDIT NOTE in 2011: I've edited this review to take out some teenage arrogance, but the rest is as-is .,
A few years later and with a degree in hand, including modules in Children's Lit, I could probably write a better review, but people seem to like this one!I really don't like Harry Potter .,
It's one of those little concealed but apparently not widely known facts about me, which shocks everyone when I say I love books and they're all, "yeah, rite, Harry Potter is so awesum rite?" and I say "..no, it really isn't." I confess: when I was eleven or twelve or so, I read them .,
I also read the Sabrina the Teenage Witch novels .,
I read everything and wasn't very discriminating about it .,
I did enjoy them .,
I continued to enjoy them until I got to Order of the Phoenix, and then I decided that all the hype aside, I just wasn't interested anymore .,
Bear in mind, then, for the rest of this "essay", that I have only read up to and including The Goblet of Fire.Cue a few years of irritation while everyone insisted I must read the rest of the books, and how dare I prefer Tolkien and Ursula Le Guin (and later, Susan Cooper) .,
I have really no objection to people reading the books and enjoying them, taking part in the fandom that surrounds them, dressing up in witchy costumes to go and pick up the most recently released volume at midnight .,
Have fun with that!,
As far as I'm concerned you're welcome to .,
I'm even quite happy to concede that yes, Harry Potter did get more people reading .,
Whether it got them reading literature or not is another matter: how many people, I wonder, have discovered a mania for reading after reading Harry Potter and then gone onto the likes of Crime and Punishment and War and Peace, or even Lord of the Rings?,
Not that many, I'll bet .,
I think they're probably reading Twilight and the like, more often than not .,
Not that it matters -- as long as people are reading.But in any case, I. Don't .,
Have .,
To .,
Read .,
Them .,
Just because I like books, does not mean I like those books .,
And I detest it every time someone shoves them in my face as 'great literature' .,
I actually had to study Harry Potter, for my English Lit/Lang A Level (for those unfamiliar with our system: A Levels are exams you take when you're about eighteen, which among other things determine whether you can go to university) .,
One of the questions we had to figure out how to answer was whether we thought Harry Potter was good literature, whether we thought it would stand the test of time, and how it was suited to the time it's currently in.It was then that I figured out that, yeah, there are things wrong with Harry Potter beyond just the hype that was irritating me so much and the feeling that Rowling in no way matched up to the giants of fantasy and sci-fi, like Tolkien .,
I studied it alongside Tom Brown's Schooldays, by Thomas Hughes .,
Do note that I didn't like that book either .,
But it's a well written, well shaped, well considered book -- and it doesn't use the same cheap tricks as Harry Potter does .,
I'm not going to say much about that, since it's not a book I liked: if I'm going to compare/contrast, I'll compare with my favourite book that is also supposed to be for younger readers, Susan Cooper's The Dark Is Rising.There's nothing wrong with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone being an amateur first novel .,
'cause that's what it is .,
I'm sure many people's first novels don't even see the light of day, and yet Harry Potter somehow made it to a publisher's and was accepted .,
The thing is, people mostly refuse to recognise that and the cheap tricks J. K. Rowling uses .,
For example, her character's names .,
'Draco Malfoy' .,
Mal, the French for bad, immediately obvious .,
'Draco', suggesting dragon?,
Or perhaps 'draconian', which has negative connotations aplenty (not that I'd necessarily attribute those particular ones to Draco) .,
Not very subtle, is it?,
'Dumbledore' .,
Who doesn't get the image of a well-meaning, if strange, old man?,
'Minerva', straight out of Greek myth: a goddess of knowledge .,
Gee, I wonder why Rowling chose that for a female teacher. .,
'Remus Lupin', 'Sirius Black', 'Mad-Eye Moody'. .,
Do I even have to say anything?And 'Harry Potter' .,
Nothing striking about that: perfectly ordinary, as names go, right?Yeah .,
And that's the point .,
Harry Potter himself is not a real character -- certainly not at first .,
He's a cypher, a convenient space into which a kid can very easily insert himself or even herself .,
He's brave .,
Okay, generic hero characteristic .,
He has doubts .,
Again, the same .,
He has a Tragic Past .,
Don't we all?,
Or don't we all like to think we do?,
Look at the Mary Sues/self inserts people write in fandom -- so often they're people with incredibly dark, melodramatic pasts that they rise above .,
Harry Potter is a convenient place to insert yourself .,
The other characters are archetypes more than anything -- Hermione, the know it all girl; Ron, the loyal friend; Dumbledore, the mentor; Malfoy, the rival..All of that is actually what makes Harry Potter a highly readable, enjoyable book, for young people and even adults .,
It's targeted very precisely toward the readership of today .,
Maybe that makes J. K. Rowling a better author than I might paint her as, that she can know her audience so well -- there's that view, I'm sure .,
But it's all very basic, and I tend to look on it as cheap tricks .,
The whole chapter, in the first book, about the Mirror of Erised -- how sad does it make you feel for Harry?,
It's sentimental, it's sad -- and it's meant to do that, very obviously .,
There's a whole chapter written just to enforce the love between the members of Harry Potter's family.Susan Cooper does it in a single paragraph that makes me want to cry every single time I read it, coming after all the build up of guilt and pain in the relationship .,
"Bran went to [his father] and put his arm round his waist, and stood close .,
It was the first gesture of affection between the two that Will had ever seen .,
And wondering, loving surprise woke in Owen Davies's worn face as he looked down at the boy's white head, and the two stood there, waiting."That paragraph does for me what Rowling's whole chapter cannot .,
It's so effective, actually, because Cooper spends a whole book leading up to it, showing us Owen and Bran's relationship .,
Rowling shows us Harry's parents, but in an unsubtle way that actually throws me out of it because I think, "Oh, yeah, this is the chapter in which we're supposed to feel very sorry for Harry."There's also a very easy, blunt misdirection .,
You're supposed to hate Snape, supposed to believe he's the one to blame for everything, and at the end, you're supposed to be as surprised as Harry when it's Quirrel waiting there for him .,
At the age of eleven, I think I went right along with that, but when I reread it for A Level, I had to wince at how heavy-handed the misdirection was .,
I understand that later in the series Snape comes into it more, and I don't know whether the misdirection turns out to be not that misdirected when it comes down to the real truth: but in the first book, you're meant to believe it's Snape all along, and I don't think J. K. Rowling does a very good job of giving us clues that it's not actually Snape, because she's so busy blackening him to lead people astray.It's also very black-and-white .,
Questions aren't raised, by this story -- and that's a thing I think is actually important in literature .,
Raise questions, discuss issues, end with a question .,
I don't know what to call stories that don't fit into that, really .,
I'm going to go with 'novels' as opposed to literature .,
Harry Potter is a novel .,
It's a story .,
I don't think it has any real lasting values .,
Susan Cooper's books, while also quite basic, discussing the Light and the Dark, do end with a question .,
If man is left on earth, to do as man will, will man be Light or Dark?,
The immortals leave earth, and say that the world -- for better or worse -- belongs to humans .,
Right now, a lot of people think the answer to that question would be 'worse' .,
But Harry Potter does not raise this question, does not raise any question, and does not answer one either .,
That's why I don't think it will last except perhaps as a phenomenon to be studied: the 'Potter mania' and what caused it.That's why I don't like Rowling's writing .,
It's not particularly refined, it's unsubtle -- and that's okay, you know, I'm not saying you can't enjoy that, can't find it refreshing .,
I don't .,
I'm also not saying that 'novels' are bad -- they're good, they can provide valuable escapism, they can be incredibly rich fodder for the imagination, and I suspect Harry Potter is, for many children .,
But I don't call it literature, and I myself don't like it.Note: the three star rating is because honestly, when I first read it, I did love it .,

Until a letter from Hogwarts arrives at his house and a big man named Hagrid tells him that he is a wizard. .,
My Opiniondon't freak out okay?,
because this is the first time I read Harry Potter .,
I know, I know .,
I'm so late but I think there's no such thing as too late when it comes to books .,
;DI read this because everyone that I know always loved this series .,
My big sister loved this series .,
My big brother also loved this series ( but he only have watched the movies, because he's not a reader ) and I think all my Goodreads friends also loved this series .,
So I was like " what am I waiting for?!,
I need to order this book" but the problem is I just bought the first book because I just wanted to try it and I had never thought that I would love this book so much .,
now I have to wait the next books to arrive at my home .,
I WAS SO STUPID!!,
I'm serious, I even cried when I finished this book because :1 .,
(view spoiler)[You know that ending, when Gryffindor wins the house cup .,
I was about to scream " GRYFFINDOR .,
GRYFFINDOR .,
GRYFFINDOR.!!" but I realised that me, my mom and my brother were in the same room and if I did that, I'm sure they would think I was crazy .,
xD .,
(hide spoiler)]2 .,
I DON'T HAVE THE SEQUEL!!,
guys, if you haven't read this book, I suggest you all to read it and don't just buy the first book .,
unless you want to end up like me .,
Why Did I Give This Book 4.9 Stars?I loved all the characters in this book, Except you, Malfoy .,
He always mocked Ron and it made me so angry!,
I mean, how could anyone hate Ron Weasley?!,
and guys I loved all the weasleys!,
George and Fred made me laugh so much and Percy!,

guys, did you like him or hate him?,
and if Peeves isn't your favorite ghost, so who's your favorite ghost?,
tell me on comment section below!so basically, I loved everything about this book .,
To be honest, I have watched all the movies before reading the book .,
I guess I watched them all like. .,
5 years ago .,
I wasn't a reader that time .,
But thankfully I don't really remember about the story but I still do remember the ending .,

I wish this book had come out when I was young, I wish that someone had convinced me to read them when they first came out, and I wish I had read this series before I watched the movies..I wish.I wish.I wish..I wish I wasn't a Muggle.The day started off the same as any other day for Vernon Dursley- he picked out his clothes for work, got dressed, listened to his wife- Petunia- as she struggled with their son -Dudley- during one of his tantrums, grabbed his briefcase, kissed them both good-byI wish this book had come out when I was young, I wish that someone had convinced me to read them when they first came out, and I wish I had read this series before I watched the movies..I wish.I wish.I wish..I wish I wasn't a Muggle.The day started off the same as any other day for Vernon Dursley- he picked out his clothes for work, got dressed, listened to his wife- Petunia- as she struggled with their son -Dudley- during one of his tantrums, grabbed his briefcase, kissed them both good-bye, got into his car and drove away from number four Privet drive .,
That is where the day took a strange turn..Vernon just chose to ignore it.He ignored the cat reading a map on the street corner outside his home .,
He ignored the people dressed in cloaks..He ignored the owls flying outside his window at work- and after some careful consideration, he decided to also ignore the whispers on the streets outside at lunch- mentioning the name Harry Potter, and the strange man that hugged him for no reason..If Vernon had been a different sort of man- he would have known life was about to change for his "happy' little family.The street lights on Privet drive flicker off one by one- and a group of four gather just outside the Dursley residence .,
Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Hargrid, set baby Harry and a letter on the doorstep .,
For Harry Potter isn't just any child and must be kept safe .,
One day he will know who he is, and one day they will come back for him.First off I would like to thank my friend Stepheny- for finally being the one to give me that extra push I needed to give in and read this wonderful book- and I do mean PUSH .,
She was relentless, and now I know why!,
Anything I say will pale in comparison to her review of HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE- so I am going to link her review and let her words take over from here..https://www.goodreads.com/review/show..Thanks Stepheny!,

"He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: 'To Harry Potter U+2014the boy who lived!'" What can I really say about the Harry Potter series that hasn't already been said before?When I was younger, I've always wanted to read the Harry Potter books .,
But as a child, I was intimidated by how thick the books were, including the first installment which also happens to be one of the more shorter books "He couldn't know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: 'To Harry Potter U+2014the boy who lived!'"

But as a child, I was intimidated by how thick the books were, including the first installment which also happens to be one of the more shorter books in the series!,
It's a funny thought now considering how I read books even more than double the size of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .,
But last year, I made a resolution to read all the Harry Potter books starting in January and finishing no later than April because Universal Studios is finally opening The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park in California .,
And what better way to reward myself for finishing the series than taking a journey through the magical world of Harry Potter!,
Chocolate Frogs, Bertie Bott's, Butter Beer, Hogwarts HERE I COME!With that being said, I really enjoyed this book as much as I thought I would .,
I loved seeing all the "bonus scenes" and dialogue that were excluded from the film and how different everything seemed as opposed to watching the films .,
However, I think I did enjoy the movie a bit more than the book .,
Maybe it's because I grew up watching the Harry Potter movies (and still do several times every year), rather than growing up and reading the books .,
So if anything, it's actually kind of backwards for me.I've noticed that the movie took on a more darker atmosphere compared to the lighter, more kid-friendly mood that the book possessed .,
A good example of this for me would be the Sorting Hat scene .,
In the movie, the Hat actually frightened and freaked me out and to be honest, it still does!,
But in the book, everyone's all happy and singing, and just WAY different from how I would've pictured it if I would have read the book first, then watched the movie .,
:PI'm really glad that the movie did such a fantastic job at depicting this book and, in some ways, made it even better .,
I thought I already knew the Wizarding World like the back of my hand but after reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, it opened my eyes to a whole new perception that the movies could never have given me .,
Although being a fan isn't determined by whether or not you've read all the books or watched all the movies, I'm really proud of myself for finally tackling this once childhood fear of mine to read the Harry Potter series .,
And for me, it feels as if I'm kicking it up a notch as a Harry Potter fanatic who's seen the movies, and is finally one step closer to finishing the books .,

I'm not going to comment on the literary shortcomings of this book, the cliches, the painfully long narrative, the fact that the characters will not think about an issue for months, but then suddenly it becomes important again .,
Smarter people than me have already said all this.What bothers me about the Harry Potter universe is its characterization of magic .,
Why is magic so easy in the Harry Potter universe?,
It's only moderately a matter of skill to use magic .,

Smarter people than me have already said all this.What bothers me about the Harry Potter universe is its characterization of magic .,
Why is magic so easy in the Harry Potter universe?,
It's only moderately a matter of skill to use magic .,
Magic is mostly saying the correct word with the correct intonation and the correct flourish of the wand and boom!,
you've done something magical .,
If it were only for small things I don't think this would bother me so much, but the same works for more serious things, like killing someone.There is so much that is contrary to logic (and I don't mean science, I mean how reasonable people would behave) in the magic of Harry Potter that it drives me crazy .,
Why is the magical world so separated from the real world?,
What is their interaction?,
If magic works in the muggle world, what is preventing someone like Voldemort from completely taking over the muggle world?,
What is preventing any character from killing any other character by simpling saying the killing curse at any time?,
Human decency?,
Obviously there are a lot of characters in the books that don't have any .,
This never made any sense to me.I would like to draw a comparison with (and I'm sure people on a site about reading books will crucify me for mentioning TV, which is obviously incapable of being an art form) Buffy the Vampire Slayer .,
In Buffy, every time you use magic, you pay for it .,
For little things, like floating a pencil, you pay for it in concentration, and maybe a little physical energy, but not more than going for a walk .,
However, the more you take, the more you have to give back in one form or another .,
The show is not always entirely consistent on this, but the idea makes sense .,
To bring someone back from the dead, you have to kill something else, or pay some other kind of price .,
If you want to kill someone, there is a physical price, a mental price .,
Nothing is free .,
In Harry Potter, it seems like everything is free.It's always put me off, and every time a fan tries to explain to me why I'm wrong it sounds like a deus ex machina, or just a plain old stretch.Also, quidditch is the most pointless sport ever created .,
Only in 1 game out of 1000 does anything 99% of the action matter to the outcome of the game .,
Only the seeker and the bludgers mean anything .,

I can remember when I was six and walked by a bookstore .,
Firstly, I didn't see it and then I rechecked the store again, that made me see this book sat on the self in the center of this store .,
I hadn't known anything about Harry Potter since then, all I know was it had a beautiful cover .,
So why didn't I give a try ?The first paragraph of this book is like magic .,
How can't you fall in love with the book narrated like a bedtime story and there's magic in it ?,
Frankly, I fall HARD for this book .,
It's my first love and the only one I can't forget .,
Harry Potter is a boy who lives in the cupboard under the stairs and his life isn't good either .,
He doesn't know that the letter arrived at his house will change his life forever .,
The story gradually reveals the secrets under and the world building is solid and intriguing .,
The magic systen is not complex but it enhances the story very good .,
U+201CTo the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.U+201DHogwart is a school that witches and wizards attend to .,
Harry feels like this is his second home since he first meets Ron and Hermione, his fellows .,
The journey starts the moment these three find out about the Sorcerer's stone and they think Snape is going to steal it for himself.I won't say much about the story part because I'm sure eveyone knows it .,
All I want to say is about the emotional part, I loved how grievous when Harry looks into The Mirror of Erised and he sees his parents .,
I like the sentence Dumbledore tells him . .,
U+201CIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.U+201DWhen I was a child, I thought this book was really fun .,
But when I grow up, this book isn't just a book for me anymore .,
Harry Potter is an abused boy in his house and he has tolerated all along, no matter what .,
Harry Potter has a scar, that stands for everyone, we all have our scars and it's up to us to let it restrain your life or let it go and prove ourself not to be the person they think you are .,
Becoming more and being something bigger than the one those people think you can be.U+201CIt takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.U+201D This book is EVERYTHING .,
My life .,
My passion .,

Harry Potter of House Gyrffindor, the first of his name, the Wizard born, Father of Adventure Seeking, Protector of Hogwarts, The Khal of Magical Realm, Breaker of Dark Magic, The Unkilled.I finally read Harry Potter.Yes, you read that correctly .,
Somehow I made it through middle school, high school, and college without reading about the Boy Who Lived .,
Sometimes I feel twinges of regret about waiting so long to join in the magic .,

Somehow I made it through middle school, high school, and college without reading about the Boy Who Lived .,
Sometimes I feel twinges of regret about waiting so long to join in the magic .,
I wonder what my childhood would have been like, if IU+2019d been able to grow up alongside Harry, Hermoine, and Ron .,
I look back at pictures of ecstatic, costumed children at book releases and movie premieres and think, man, that could have been me!,
I imagine how excruciating it would have been to wait years between the installments, instead of just a few days .,
(I know, IU+2019m incredibly spoiled).But at the same time, I know I was able to glean a whole lot from my first-time reading of Harry Potter that my 12-year old or 15-year old self would never have noticed or appreciated .,
ItU+2019s a testament to the vivid imagination, dedication, and literary prowess of J.K Rowling that for most of the series I barely felt at all that I was reading books meant for children.Here are just a few great things I took away from Harry Potter as a first-time, grown up reader.The Sadness inside Harry.Harry is our man .,
We get to see the world through his eyes .,
And, having lacked any kind of familial love and security as a child, naturally heU+2019s going to be a bit on the wild side .,
When youU+2019re a kid, youU+2019re happy to get into trouble right along with him!,
After all, youU+2019re learning about Hogwarts and the Wizarding world just like he is .,
But manU+2026as an adult, you really feel and understand the hurt, the loneliness Harry has to go through.HeU+2019s a kid who had so much working against him, and most of the people he trusted were either dead or lying to him for most of his life .,
As Harry matures and we see how much heU+2019s willing to sacrifice for those he loves, even the grown-ups canU+2019t help but take a page from HarryU+2019s book .,
HeU+2019s the boy who lived, loved, and won our hearts.Hermoine is so incredibly inspiringOK, so, this is pretty obvious to anyone who reads the book, no matter their age .,
But itU+2019s even more powerful and inspiring to watch Hermoine grow up from an older perspective .,
She is the definition of a self-made woman .,
Hailing from muggle origins (the daughter of dentists, no less) only-child Hermoine Granger has to rely on her own gumption to succeed at Hogwarts .,
She doesnU+2019t have magical blood, a famous pedigree, a secret vault full of money, or even an older sibling to teach her the ropes .,
But gosh darn it, sheU+2019s got the library, and a copy of Hogwarts: A History, and sheU+2019s going to succeed if it kills her.As a fellow young woman trying to make my way in the world, how could Hermoine not be my hero?,
Her flaws teach me that humility is important to making my relationships work .,
Her strengths teach me that being a nerd is OK .,
Her care and preparedness save the day (and usually someoneU+2019s life).Words Matter SO MUCHWe all know this great quote from Dumbledore: U+201CCall him Voldemort, Harry .,
Always use the proper name for things .,
Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.U+201DThe older I grow, the more I realize how much pain in our world stems from fear and avoidance .,
And, as Dumbledore counseled, this only makes bad situations worse .,
When we see something rotten in the world and want to find a solution, we canU+2019t just chalk it up to some vague term .,
We have to call things what they are, whether itU+2019s U+201CRacism,U+201D U+201CSexism,U+201D or another of the many harmful ways humans treat each other .,
Just like Wizards couldnU+2019t unite to stand against vague U+201Cevil,U+201D something which could not be named, so we in the Muggle world have to be brave and name our Voldemorts when they arise, in order to effectively make a changeMy list could go on and on .,
But why not crack open The SorcererU+2019s Stone and revisit the magic for yourself?,
If itU+2019s been a while since you read the Potter books, youU+2019re in for an avalanche of new lessons and feels that you might have been too young to appreciate the first time around .,
So what is Harry Potter and The PhilosopherU+2019s Stone?Good question .,
But first I ask you, what is magic?To me, magic is the captivating voice of the imagination, transmutable and quantifiable, it finds its verve in the proper arrangement of words .,
These words can make you laugh, and cry, and dream dreams that will never die.It would go without saying that Jo Rowling changed the world when she created Harry Potter, and the result is a deeply meaningful and shareable universe as vast and grand as StSo what is Harry Potter and The PhilosopherU+2019s Stone?Good question .,

These words can make you laugh, and cry, and dream dreams that will never die.It would go without saying that Jo Rowling changed the world when she created Harry Potter, and the result is a deeply meaningful and shareable universe as vast and grand as Star Wars, Final Fantasy, and enrapturing works that have continued to span generations with the perfect combination of action, creativity, and character .,
As this is my very first reading of Harry Potter and I have never seen the movies (though some things have been spoiled, but not many) I was so happy to treat myself with the release of Vault of Dreams to the UK Bloomsbury 2010 set that comes in a wonderful red box, and I have two lovely friends to thank for this, Chelsea (Slytherpuff) and Chenda (Slytherin), because without their friendship and enthusiasm, this vast landscape of literary gold would still be void in my life.Whilst Potter is undeniably English, its likability constitutes some of the very best qualities of Anglophilia (like Christmas pudding and the Hogwarts Express), and reminds us that the stone set in the silver sea has not only some of the greatest writers (male and female) the world has ever seen, but continues to capture our lust for fantastical adventure as a place so heavily steeped in magic, mystery, and muggle-dom, that PotterU+2019s inherent Englishness makes it overly charming and utterly adorable, and, for me, tearfully nostalgic .,
The very definition of timeless, not only for its colorful cast of characters (a true ensemble series this is!,
With someone for everyone to love or hate!) or its prose (lighter than C.S .,
LewisU+2019 Narnia but just as enchanting) or its cleverness and conceptualization, Harry Potter finds the precious space in our hearts that weU+2019ve all been endowed, the perfect space to live and dream and desire to be great, to know that destiny is a powerful force at work in our lives, but life is still and adventure full of choices, and the key to truly living is truly the most unexplainably magical idea there is, was, and ever will be, and that is love.Recommended for everyone!And get that beautiful red box set whilst you're at it!,
The covers are  .,
Rereading Harry Potter always feels like coming home .,
It was so nice to start at the beginning with Harry before he knew he was a wizard .,
The wonder and amazement he felt as he arrived at Hogwarts .,
The friendship that formed among Harry, Ron, and Hermione .,
Also seeing the little things when I know now how everything ends and ties together .,
It's just the coziest, most beautiful feeling to be back at Hogwarts and I cannot wait to continue my reread of the series .,

I particularly have a great weakness for Hagrid and Dumbledore, who has the most beautiful and profound sentences in this book, besides always manages to take off a smile :) .,
U+201CThe truth." Dumbledore sighed .,
"It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.U+201D So, I hope to continue with the series and hopefully ,every time, can surprise me a bit more and more , it is nice to see, at last, why fuss xD.P.S: I managed to understand with this book, that the film has been so successful, because it clearly is a reflection of the book, for me it was easy to imagine each scene and that's incredible !.Cuz I know, as readers, we always excited us with the idea that our favorite book this on the big screen, and the truth it's, that never reach our expectations, ending to be only a shadow of what the book was .,
In this case, I value that have respected so much the book when they did the movie, it is something to highlight .,
:) U+201CIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.U+201D  .,
I swear every time I read this book I fall even more in love with it!,
This series (because IU+2019ve read the whole series) is and will always be one of my favourites!!!I loved everything about it and just the whole plot is amazing .,
Sometimes books never live up to their hype but with this book, I can actually understand why so many people like it .,
I canU+2019t even explain my love for this series .,
IU+2019ve watched the movies so many times and read the books only once which is probably why I'm reading it again .,

IU+2019ve watched the movies so many times and read the books only once which is probably why I'm reading it again .,
I do have to admit I was really late and read this book only last year .,
After reading the Cursed Child I just had to read this series again and so I did and I loved it even more!I read this series around the end of last year but I have a perfectly good explanation for that .,
Oh and also I may have made the mistake of watching the movies many times before reading the books .,
I was quite young when I first wanted to read the series .,
I was maybe 10 years old or younger and because I was a stupid little child that knew nothing about the series I decided to read three of the books out of order .,
I didnU+2019t realise I had to read them in order and I didnU+2019t even know the order .,
So anyway it took me around 3 months to finish Goblet of Fire and one month to finish Half-Blood Prince .,
I mean come on I was young and didn't read as much as I do now .,
After that I never really cared about the series .,
Around two years ago I became one of those people that thought Harry Potter was overrated (IU+2019m so sorry guys .,
I didnU+2019t know why it was so popular) and didnU+2019t think it was that great (I didnU+2019t read that much at the time) .,
Then I watched the movies and loved them and decided to order the first book online .,
It arrived and I was so excited and thenU+2026 It was in some random language that I didnU+2019t understand .,
I didnU+2019t even know what language it was!,
That was when I gave up on the series until last year where I decided to read the series .,
Now after all that unnecessary information on to the actual story .,
I read this two weeks ago and I canU+2019t remember the small details to do a review so this is going to be a very brief review .,
EveryoneU+2019s probably read this book so IU+2019m not going to say what it's about because that would be unnecessary .,
Everything about this book is wonderful and the magical world just blew me away .,
IU+2019m so obsessed that sometimes my sister (who hasnU+2019t read the books was but watched the movies) and I pretend to fight for like one minute and shout out spells at each other .,
Yeah, IU+2019m really weird .,
Now donU+2019t get me wrong I love all the character (the good ones) but someone of the main characters aren't that bright *cough* Harry *cough* .,
To be honest I didnU+2019t really think he was that dumb until my friend showed me this thing about why Harry Potter is not in Ravenclaw and it made me realise that he is really an idiot .,
I would tell you what the reasons are but they spoil the other books so IU+2019m just going to say them when I read the other books .,
There is one situation where Harry tries to catch the letters in the air and not just pick one of the ground and hide it .,
They were everywhere so why the hell does he need to grab the ones flying .,
Yeah, he does manage to get one but he could have got one in a second .,
Hermione is my favourite character mainly because sheU+2019s so smart and without her none of it would have been possible .,
Harry was so stupid and donU+2019t get me started on Ron .,
Hermione was amazing she was the one that was able to figure everything out .,
This series will always be a series that I will never get sick of .,
I read this book so quickly .,
I flew through it and didnU+2019t even realise it .,
Everything about is is just perfect and if youU+2019re someone who doesn't read this is the best book to get you into it .,
Even though this is my second time reading it and I know everything that happens it still is just as good .,
Also, do not be deceived, this book is not for children only .,

She mines gold from this rich and storied tradition, but doesn't really fashion anything unique from it.We can see the beginnings of Rowling's authorial failings (and a hint of her strengths as well) .,

She mines gold from this rich and storied tradition, but doesn't really fashion anything unique from it.We can see the beginnings of Rowling's authorial failings (and a hint of her strengths as well) .,
She adopts Rouald Dahl's 'awful family' trope, though it's clear that Rowling does not have the gift of bizarre characterization or the knowledge of the darker parts of the human soul that made his books resonate.She writes sympathetic characters, but not unusual ones .,
Overall her writing has relatively little character or style .,
Then again, mass success often requires leaving the more unusual s behind .,
So she relies on standard character types, managing to keep them afloat through the patented perpetual plot of the airplane book.She also pulls from that old British tradition of 'children lost in fairyland', seen often in early fantasy (Dunsany, Eddison), which Lewis also made use of .,
She also has the vast, unknown underground of magic just beneath our world which keeps itself always mysterious and quiet, much favored by Gaiman and other Urban Fantasy authors (though Rowling's invented world is strained and piecemeal, moreso as the series goes on).The strength of the book is that it combines the tradition of the 'child in fairyland' with another British standby: the boarding school bildungsroman .,
It's the same neat trick Mervyn Peake pulled in 'Gormenghast', though Rowling's version is tame in comparison .,
Her tale of the intellectual, emotional, and physical growth of the young, outcast everyman is rather predictable, except for some insight into angst in the fifth book.Rowling's prose is quick and simple, but sometimes awkward and without music or joy .,
It is not the sort of deliberate simplicity Carroll achieved by expressing complex ideas in playful terms .,
It is rather the sign of an author whose unsophisticated voice prevents her language from vaulting higher.Simplistic elegance is deceptively difficult to achieve, and so it's hard to blame Rowling too much when she falters .,
It's unfortunate that she didn't put a few failed books under her belt before finding success, as such early outings are often best winnowed chaff.Her plotting--as ever--is scattered and convenient; though in a shorter book, it shows less .,
Her plot twists, as usual, disappoint; they are not built upon progression of events but upon reader expectation and emotional red herrings.It's the beginning of an enjoyable series, but there's really no need to start any earlier than the third book, when Rowling finally finds her pace and begins to lean more heavily on that which she does well, which helps to hide her faults .,
Watch the movie if you need a primer.My Fantasy Book Suggestions  .,
it's even better with the drop dead gorgeous illustrations, and i didn't think that was possible .,
i only wish it had come out when i was a child because i probably would have loved it even more!,

I'm not going to bother with a description of the plot, because unless you've been living under a rock for the past almost 20 years, you know what Harry Potter is about .,
Instead, this is just a spot for me to put down my thoughts, feelings and history with this series.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was first released in the US on September 1, 1998 by Scholastic .,
I was 9 years old..the same age that my daughter (my oldest) is now .,
But I didn't read this that year .,
I actually read this out of order initially, and read this book only after reading and falling in love with Chamber of Secrets .,
So I was 11 the first time I ever picked up a Harry Potter book, the same age as Harry and company in this book .,
For me, it made it all the more magical and relatable to grow up alongside the characters and to be roughly the same age as they were as the books were released .,
I had already enjoyed reading, but Harry Potter is the first book series that I ever truly loved..that I could read over and over again, and never grow tired of it.I still react with shock to the people who tell me they've ONLY watched these movies, never read the books (my husband included) and start ranting about all the amazing details they're missing out on..I'm almost as bad as a religious fanatic in that regard, trying to convert everyone into a Potterhead .,
I can't even watch the movies without thinking about everything from the books being left out.Now here I am, years later as an adult and with a family of my own, finally reading my illustrated copy of the first Harry Potter book .,
Which is GORGEOUS!,
This edition is a MUST for any true fan .,
Now that I'm older, I appreciate Rowling's writing that much more .,
It truly is magical .,
She manages to create a whole amazing world, with details galore and manages to introduce you into the world without it feeling like a huge info dump .,
Everything is so carefully explained, that it all feels completely legit .,
For me, she will always be the Queen, hands down.Favorite Quotes:*It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.*After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.*It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends .,
This was a reread for me (obviously) and it was so heartwarming and perfect .,
Rereading Harry Potter is like coming home .,
I listened to it on audio because Jim Dale is bae .,
Seriously, his Hagrid voice is my life .,
Growing up I always had a love/hate relationship with Harry as the main character, but this time around I just loved the lil guy .,

Maybe it's because of all the tumblr headcanon I've read, but I honestly cried when he opened his Christmas presents and when he went to see his parents in the mirror every night .,
(tbh everything about this book made me emotional.)This reread also made me realize how many serious topics HP touches on: bullying, making friends, loss, love, etc.  .,
Since I'm incredibly late to the party, I don't feel there is much I can say that hasn't already been said .,
That in mind, I thoroughly enjoyed this beginning to a wonderful, magical journey .,
I can't wait to continue on with these new friends .,

There always seems to be something knew I pick up every time .,
Like the dreams Harry has of a QuirrelU+2019s turban talking to him telling him he is supposed to be in Slytherin .,
Albus Dumbledore liking 10 pin bowling and wanting wool socks more than anything else but people always give him books.I get so nostalgic every single time I read this and I love OlivanderU+2019s wand shop, the beginning of the friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione and how could we ever forget the crazy twin and all their hilarious antics .,

I'M ALSO GOING TO ADD A FEW PICTURES THAT ARE IN THE BOOK SO YOU CAN SEE HOW BEAUTIFUL IT IS AND RUN OUT AND BUY IT, IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY!LET US BEGIN!Poor Harry's parents were killed by VOLDEMORT!,
Yep, I said it :-) So Dumbledore (the head honcho) and the gang decide to leave Harry with his mother's sister, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon and their brat of a son, Dudley .,
This was a huge mistake because they were so mean to him growing up .,
He had to live in a cupboard under the stairs and wear Dudley's hand-me-downs .,
They didn't get him gifts or do anything nice for him .,
:-( They didn't even tell him what really happened to his parents, what they were and what he was. .,
until one day .,
on his eleventh birthday he started getting all of these letters in the mail inviting him to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .,
But his stupid family tried to keep the letters from Harry, this didn't go over well and we get to meet sweet, wonderful Hagrid .,
:-)Hagrid is stunned that Harry doesn't know anything about anything and begins to fill him in, he also brings him a cake for his bday :-)Moving on .,
so Harry finds out about all the things he needs to find out about and Hagrid carts him off to the bank to get all of this money his parents left for him so he can buy supplies for school!,
I just loved in the movies and the books when they went shopping at Diagon Alley .,
I want to go there!,
After Harry gets to school he gets into Gryffindor with his new friends, Ron, Hermione (my heroine), all of the Weasley's, and Neville .,
There are a lot of sweet people in their house .,
He has an arch nemesis named Malfoy that get into Slytherin, the house Voldemort was in at one time .,
Soooooo. .,
I'm not going to tell every little thing about the book as most have read it and some that haven't just might take a little peek :-) Let's sum this up to say that Harry gets on the Quidditch team (read to find out what that is), there are trolls with nasty snot, a secret the group are trying to figure out, great times spent with Hagrid, many magical moments and an appearance of sorts by someone that will not be named...I'm going to leave you with some pictures from the book, I had no idea that Jim Kay who is the illustrator is the same man who illustrated, "A Monster Calls," by Patrick Ness and he also has a rescued greyhound like me :-) Yay!,
..OH and there will be no captions to the pictures, you can figure out most yourself or just look at the pretty pictures, just know that there are many more pictures in the book and all of the pages have something cool on them!,
I highly recommend this edition of the book!I will say again to go out and buy this illustrated edition, it's so wonderful and I can't wait to get the rest of them in the illustrated editions!!!!!!!!,
Like yesterday!!!!!!,
Kudos to J.K. Rowling for writing the series and to Jim Kay for his wonderful illustrations!,
Professor McGonagall approves :-)I LOVED TAKING THIS TRIP BACK DOWN MEMORY LANE WITH THE GROUP AND THE MAGIC!,
There is really no way to do this book justice .,
I felt years younger in spirit just from reading it .,
This is all .,
always good for a comfort read .,

I started to read these books back in third grade, when they were first becoming like "THE BIG THING" .,
I read the first two and a half, and then gave up for one reason or another .,
I got bored I guess?,
Eh, don't remember .,
And then I just never got around to reading them, and everyone was constantly talking about them and bugging me to read them like "*POKE POKE* BRIGID READ HARRY POTTER!" So I was like, "Yeah U+2026 I'm not going to because I'm a nonconformist!" And basically the whole thing just became really annoying . .,
because the more people told me to read them, the more I didn't want to .,
If that makes sense.Well, finally my sisters gave into the whole craze and became obsessed just like everyone else .,

Although yeah, I know the books get more mature, which is why I'll keep reading.Over all, it was enjoyable .,
But I guess I see why, at age 9, I didn't feel compelled to keep reading .,
There were a few things that irked me ..a) First of all, the whole story seemed to go by much too fast .,
I guess, you know, it's for kids and all .,
But still, quite a lot of things happened with no down-time in between .,

And after that, it ended quite abruptly.However, in Rowling's defense . .,
I understand that this was her first book, and so agents/publishers probably pressured her to cut out as much as possible .,

I don't know what it is, but I didn't feel much of an attachment to him .,
Maybe it was because everyone is always fawning over him?,
Like, wherever he goes everyone's like "OOOH IT'S THE AWESOMETASTICAL HARRY POTTER!" (Maybe I'm just jealous?,
Haha.) And he didn't have much of like an "attitude", at least not in this book .,
Eh . .,
I assume he'll develop more later on.As for what I liked . .,
As I mentioned already, good characters .,
Also, it's a very creative story .,
Rowling's world-building is very detailed, which adds more to the suspension of disbelief and whatnot .,

He also has an opportunity to go to a wizard school which he jumps at without a second thought .,
He makes some friends,enemies and learns some details about his parents' death.Make no mistake here: this is a children book .,
This is also a book which brought a lot of children to reading for which it gets major bonus points from me .,
Do not think the series remain this way: the books become more and more mature as Harry Potter and his friends grow up.As far as the story goes, it is highly entertaining and remains so throughout the whole series .,
This book in particular is notable for really showing a sense of wonder when we (and Harry) finally get to see the wizard's world .,
The movie based on this novel does an excellent job in this as well; succeeding at something almost every other ones based on fantasy books fail; it also nailed the casting .,
I also really need to point out something else .,
It is not a secret anymore (was it ever?) what J.K. Rowling is a woman .,
Two of her major characters and countless number of minor ones are boys .,
She does write them as real life boys which takes talent and some experience which I suppose comes from her having a son .,
I do not even need to mention that her main female character grows up to be strong and caring young woman.This book is suitable for both children and adults alike .,
Do not be deceived by its seemingly childish beginning .,
I used to hate Harry Potter.Now before you hoist your pitchforks and torches, allow me to explain.When I was a wee child of six, my dad decided it'd be a good idea to introduce me to the seriesU+2014starting from the Goblet of Fire .,
Back then, I was a vivacious reader, but mainly of chapter books, like Junie B. Jones or Bailey School Kids .,

The thickest book I'd read was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.So when my dad plunked this gigantic doorstopper of a book in front of me, I quickly lost interest and deemed Harry Potter boring and overhyped .,
I carried this opinion through my teenage years, rolling my eyes at the people who'd pillaged bookstores at midnight and refusing my uncle's generous offer to purchase me the entire series because he knew I liked to read.Fast forward to 2009, when I was deep in the clutches of Twilight and desperate for something to fill the power vacuum Breaking Dawn had left .,
Then I stumbled across Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in my school library."What the hell," I'd thought .,
"There's nothing else to read anyway."I'd settled on a cushy couch, flicked to the first page and laid eyes on this: "Mr and Mrs Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much." It was all over for me .,
I read past the tardy bell, begged the librarian to let me keep it, even though we weren't allowed to check out books that early on in the school year .,
I zoomed through it in class and snuck the Chamber of Secrets and the Prisoner of Azaban home under my coat .,
I even pleaded my mother to haul The Goblet of Fire, Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, those thick, heavy hardbacks, home from her school's library (my mom's a teacher), so I wouldn't be left Potter-less during the weekend .,
Having come across them long overdue, I knew major spoilers, including who would die in the end, yet it still broke my heart when I read The Deathly Hallows.There are no words to describe how much I love Harry Potter, and how much I want to smack my 14-year-old for obsessing over a controlling, douchebag vampire when I could have been laughing and swooning at Fred and George Weasley's antics.I am not part of the Potter generation .,
But I wish I had been .,
I was in eighth grade when my mom brought me home a paperback copy of Harry Potter and the SorcererU+2019s Stone .,
I immediately gave her the most outraged look possible and couldnU+2019t believe that she would be handing me something as ridiculous as Harry Potter .,
U+201CBut Mom!U+201D I said, U+201CI read Stephen King .,
This book is for kids!U+201D Well, if there is one thing my mom knows, it is her children .,
So she said back to me: U+201CStepheny, they are talking about banning this book from the schools.U+201D Well, that was all itI was in eighth grade when my mom brought me home a paperback copy of Harry Potter and the SorcererU+2019s Stone .,

So she said back to me: U+201CStepheny, they are talking about banning this book from the schools.U+201D Well, that was all it took .,
She knew me well enough and knew my feelings on book-banning .,
I waited until she walked out of the room before cautiously picking the book up, not wanting to give her the satisfaction of knowing she hit the right button .,
I skimmed the back cover and had an internal conflict as to whether or not I was actually going to read Harry Potter .,
Sure, people were talking about this book everywhere, but come onU+2026itU+2019s a childrenU+2019s book!,
After a few minutes of going back and forth inside my own head I decided I would at the very least give it a shot .,
I mean, why not, right?,
I told myself that if I didnU+2019t like it I could put it down and move on with my life .,
I finished that book that same day .,
I picked it up, became so immersed that I couldnU+2019t put it down and it was over before I knew what had just happened .,
Later that evening, I asked my mom if she could pick me up the other 2 books of the series that were already out .,
When she gave me the next two I finished those and had to wait for a whole year before I could get my hands on the fourth oneU+2026 I was hooked .,
There is a reason that I encourage people to read this series .,
It is life-changing .,
For me anyway .,
I would re-read the first books before the new one was coming out, would wait in the endless lines at midnight to get my copy, and stay up the rest of the night reading until my eyes forced themselves shut against my insistence that they stay open .,
I am a part of the Harry Potter generation, even if I got a late start .,
I have continued the tradition of re-reading the series every year and I am telling you- it never gets old .,
In fact, it makes me feel young again .,
It takes me back to my young, carefree days when life was easy and made sense .,
I read this series because I love every word of it .,
The characters are unforgettable, the storyline is an adventure and the series itself is perfection .,
This book has seen me through my worst days .,
It saw me through my awkward teenage years, my insecure post-high school years and the uncomfortable years where you are trying to define who you are and where you stand in the world .,
And when my father was first diagnosed with cancer, I turned to this book to help me out .,
It has never once let me down .,
I tell people to read the first few books to get a feel for the story, but know they are definitely childrenU+2019s books .,
(That, by no means, lowers the level of enjoyment.) But as the story progresses, the storyline matures, as do the characters .,
I see a piece of myself in nearly every character and I think that is what helps make Harry Potter such an incredible experience .,
Even if the situations are a little extreme, you can relate to the characters .,
The world is so real, you just know it actually exists and that JKR has been granted access-which is why she was able to write about it- DUH!,
I am thankful I was able to convince my GR buddy, Delee, to pick these books up, and even more thrilled that she loved it .,
So far, every person I have persuaded has enjoyed the books, and that is an incredible feat- if not only for the reason that every person I have persuaded has had very different tastes in books .,
These books are truly something special .,
With as many times as I have read these books, this is the first time I have tried to write a review .,
(How do you even write a review for HP?!) I guess I can sum it up with this: I will continue to re-read these books until I am dead and hope to one day share it with the children I donU+2019t have yet .,
This is more than just a book-it is a part of who I am .,
I primarily wanted to reread this book in honor of the Banned Books Week (this series is #1 on the Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2000-2009 list) .,
It also happened that I was on vacation in Orlando and, surely enough, a Universal Studios Hogwarts visit was a must .,
Oh, the nostalgia!,
A lot has been said already about the series, so I won't repeat .,
I just feel very, very sad for the kids whose parents choose to ban these books from their houses and their lives .,

These books have given me a lot pleasure over the years, but I have to praise them especially for their ability to turn the old me and my equally old husband into children who can still sigh in delight at seeing Hogwarts, the Sorting Hat, the Olivander's (almost) come to life and smile from ear to ear just because we were drinking butterbeer at Three Broomsticks (it's very tasty, BTW)!(I've been there and "flown" on a broomstick with Harry Potter!)  .,
If you donU+2019t know what a Muggle is by now, youU+2019re either Rip van Winkle or enormously stubborn.enormously stubborn. .,
yup, that shoe fits!,

The only challenge I encountered reading this was this little voice speaking in perfect British accent that was manipulating my entire reading .,
That stubborn voice prolonged the entire process because it wanted to be heard and so many times that voice managed its way through my mouth making me read the words aloud in this foreign voice thatU+2019s definitely not my own .,
Lol .,
^^I know IU+2019m not making sense anymore so IU+2019ll stop but before that let me just say that I loved all the characters (of course except the despicable ones) but that who made the strongest impression upon me isU+2026.surprise, surprise!,
That quote above belongs to him .,
He amuses and surprises me all the time despite his little but hugely significant roles in the entire story .,
I was laughing out loud at his mention of eating a vomit flavored bean and then trying another only to taste the earwax flavored one .,
But except from his hilarity, everything he says is a precious gem .,
U+201CAfter all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.U+201D I know it sounds too much, but I was laughing and crying at the bookU+2019s perfect ending .,

You guys are the best!,

A cute, funny children's book, just the right length, with a nicely constructed, self-contained plot and a good ending.Well, obviously we want to turn it into a huge, bloated, ridiculously self-important seven-volume series .,
Nothing else would make sense .,

It's a favorite of mine and I'm sure every bookworm who's out there can appreciate and understand the reason why.I was one of those little kids that run around dressed up like Harry .,
For the record, I really did .,
I would wear those round glasses and swish and flick my wand around and I took so pride in doing so.It took me some time to read the books because I didn't use to be a bookworm, I only started appreciating the magic of books, like two years ago .,
I read this last year and after seeing the movie countless times I still didn't feel like reading something forcefully or something I knew what its story was going to be, although I did.J.K .,
Rowling created a world that is so genuine, so detailed, so real .,
She took a word, magic, and she gave new meaning to it, creating spells, traditions to follow magic throughout this magnificent journey .,
She created these three real, passionate, and amazing characters that we all love and in a way we grew together .,
This is my childhood .,
No, not the books .,
But I was fan of the movies ever since the first one and maybe I wasn't one of the lucky ones to read the book from the beginning I still have a word at saying that we were lucky to grow up into the Harry Potter generation.This, as you all know, is the first novel in the series and it's an introduction mostly .,
Its size is not so big but trust me it's a wondrous book that makes every little kid's fantasy (and why not kid-grown ups) run wild .,
I love this and how juvenile it is .,
Harry, Ron, Hermione, they're all so cute and small, they're just little kids, chasing down the adventure.We all know who Harry and his sidekicks are .,
We all know about his lightning-shaped scar .,
We all know what he's been through when he was just a little boy.So, I dare you, if you're my age, 19 that is, and you're a fan of the movies but have never given this book the chance it deserves, read the hell out of it .,
It's never to late.Thanks for reading my review..more "I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter..After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Names did great things - terrible, yes, but great."The feels and memories this read has brought back is unreal .,
Can't say more than this is: From beginning to end ~ Everything was: Harry Harry my dearest Harry this book was you finding out who you are and that you were not just any ordinary boy .,
Harry Potter: Harry Potter has and always will have a special place in my heart, so my rating comes as no surprise .,
However, my rereading of the first book this time around was quite special because I read the recently published illustrated version .,
I must say that the illustrations very much enhanced the story and made it even more magical .,
They are unique because they don't look like what we see in the movies, but at the same time they were exactly as I would've pictured them to be .,

I know I loved it, and I can't wait till the second edition comes out .,
Harry Potter changed my life .,
If I hadnU+2019t read Harry Potter when I did I would not be the same person today .,
What I am today, in a part is due to Harry .,
I cannot really say enough to make you understand how much Harry Potter means to me .,
Publishers have my sympathy .,
If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize .,
I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range .,
If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number ofPublishers have my sympathy .,

If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time .,
And I've read it twice to my daughter, Celyn .,
We read the first 5 some years back, and now she's 12 we're going to read the whole lot .,
She's very disabled and can't read for herself (she can't hold the book or see the page for starters..) Having just finished I've checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2 .,
So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review. .,
I liked the book .,
I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children's book or why so many adults are so taken with it .,
JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily .,
She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child .,
Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences?,
If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test . .,
or the key hadn't been left in the same room as the door that wouldn't yield to magic . .,
would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure?,
Yes . .,
it was more fun this way, but . .,
dammit . .,
kids aren't stupid..But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one. .,
it's all good .,
Celyn certainly enjoyed it .,
She's on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that 'muggles' are somehow lesser .,
That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we're invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so) .,
But all the time I read this I'm feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing .,
I will report back on book 2 when we're done.Es la primera vez que leo Harry Potter (lo sU+00E9, verdad?,
Pero oye nunca es demasiado tarde para leer un libro) y me ha encantado .,
HacU+00EDa la mitad del libro hubieron algunas partes que me aburrieron un poco pero lo demU+00E1s me gustU+00F3 y mucho .,
Tengo ganas de seguir leyendo las aventuras de Harry por que creo que acabarU+00E9 muy enamorada de esta saga .,
I am not going to review Harry Potter, that is just an impossible task .,
However, after reading many people's personal stories linked to Harry Potter I got inspired to share mine as well!,
It'll be a long and boring reminiscing..My childhood was not exposed to J.K.Rowling .,
In fact, Harry Potter remained untouched until I was 12 years old.I was an avid inhaler reader of spooky books .,

In fact, Harry Potter remained untouched until I was 12 years old.I was an avid inhaler reader of spooky books .,
Many children at that age were probably attending Hogwarts already (Harry Potter was booming back then) but I was stuck in another planet where your worst nightmares can come to life .,
Other times, I'll be battling off angry ghosts from lighthouses, zapping aliens with laser guns, dodging dungeon trolls, wrestling off demonic doppelgangers, getting haunted by talking dummies and going back and forth from one dimension to the next .,
Sometimes, I was scouring places for clues to solve puzzling mysteries.I suppose you can say that my childhood was still just as adventurous minus witches & wizards & magical schools.Finally, I was burnt out from all my usual, preferable book series .,
I have completed all the Spooksville adventures Christopher Pike had offered, I've read The Book of Nightmares by John Peel countless times already that I made myself sick of it, I was dead tired of R.L.Stine's repetitions in his Goosebumps books, and I didn't own enough copies of The Secret Five series by Enid Blyton .,
I had nothing else to read aside from childish picture books .,
Then come one day when my sister came home with a bulging plastic bag from Times bookstore .,
When we spilled out the content together, there were 4 books and Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was among them.You see, when I was first introduced to Harry Potter, I did not start with The Sorcerer's Stone as I should have but instead, the starter book for me was The Chamber of Secrets (My sister was a bit of a noob at book buying .,
She didn't realize she bought the second book instead of the first!) .,
I remembered thinking how VERY ODD and UNIQUE this world of witchcraft & wizardry was .,
And believe me, I've read some strange stuffs before Harry Potter came into the picture.I knew I had missed out on a few details from the first book but I've watched the movies and they were enough to provide me the information I needed to know.Here's where the plot twist come to play - right after I was done with The Chamber of Secrets, I extinguished Harry Potter out of my mind .,
My sister and I did not want to own the rest of the books either .,
Plus, I simply wasn't that interested to continue reading and thought it was quite pointless to read the books when the movies were at my reach .,
(You are more than welcomed to kick the old me in the shins .,
I can't believe I was so unimaginative!)It was 4 years later, at 16, when I re-returned to this series .,
I was quite late to jump into bandwagon, I know but damn it, the last movie ended quite a while ago and I've rewatched and rewinded them all so many times than I can count .,
I fucking missed Harry Potter .,
Well, I was still side-eyeing the books mistrustfully but one day, when I was feeling rebellious, I bought the entire box set (my old copy of The Chamber of Secrets was long lost) and here I am, doing my 5th reread of the series.Stories are even more magical to read than to watch onscreen .,
That much I realized .,
I feel like kicking myself even as I write this for thinking, once, that the Harry Potter movies are better than the books .,
I didn't truly or fully apprecite the written words before but J.K.Rowling had given me a WAKE UP!,
call and I have her to thank for that.This being my fifth reread, I was worried the analytical reader in me will shred the book apart and nitpick every single details but to my surprise, I did not .,
I still love every single moment as much as I had the first time around .,
I still found The Dursleys reaction to magic hilariously comical, Hermione's and Ron's banters are adorable and rip-roaringly funny at times (oh, they were so meant to be) and I enjoyed J.K.Rowling's ability to weave up an entire new bizarre world with its own set systems and good lord, her food description is absolutely fantastic .,
My mouth waters even at the thought of Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Juice, Butterbeer and every single meals the house elves at Hogwarts have to offer .,
I'd even try a taste at Bertie Bott's Every Flavour beans.In a nutshell, this entire series is utterly magical (Need I say more?) and I won't ever forget this anytime soon.I am only 9 years late to the party, but I have finally started this series!!,

I would live in fear of being strung up the nearest Muggle tree!,

ItU+2019s time for a little confession: I have survived eighteen years without ever having read any Harry Potter book or having watched any Harry Potter movie .,
I remember seeing glimpses of the third or fourth movie in my childhood on a friendU+2019s birthday, but thatU+2019s about everything which connected me with the world of Harry Potter .,
More recently, a friend of mine forced me to finally watch the movies, not understanding how I could still have had a relatively enjoyable childhood without the presenceItU+2019s time for a little confession: I have survived eighteen years without ever having read any Harry Potter book or having watched any Harry Potter movie .,
I remember seeing glimpses of the third or fourth movie in my childhood on a friendU+2019s birthday, but thatU+2019s about everything which connected me with the world of Harry Potter .,
More recently, a friend of mine forced me to finally watch the movies, not understanding how I could still have had a relatively enjoyable childhood without the presence of Harry Potter in it .,
So here I am, having read the first book approximately ten years too late, and regretting to never have read it before.The novel actually has a lot of flaws which I could start to criticize right now .,
But apart from the assumption that it would gain me some enemies, what would be the point of it?,
This book is magical exactly the way it has been written .,
Even its flaws made me laugh or at least chuckle, and during every other page of the book, I wanted to be a part of Hogwarts .,
I always thought of the HP series as being set in a world designed for children, but now I understand how wrong my thinking was .,
Furthermore, I canU+2019t stop comparing it to the Chronicles of Narnia, which are set in another magical world U+2013 yet the writing seems so much more childish .,
RowlingU+2019s style addresses children, teens and adults alike, and thatU+2019s what I admire most about her writing.IU+2019m only 57 days older than the first book of the Harry Potter series as of its publication date, yet it has needed 6746 days before I finally entered the world of Hogwarts along with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom and all the other well-known characters connected with the series, and two more days before I finished the first year in Hogwarts .,
The only possible way for me to make good for avoiding RowlingU+2019s book for such a long time is to read all the six following novels .,
Soon.And to await the arrival of my own Hogwarts letter.U+201CIt was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.U+201D I'm not going to attempt to review this book, but I'll leave you all with this .,
We all need a hug sometimes, especially after rereading Harry Potter.GOODREADS SUCKS!,
GOODREADS SUCKS!,
GOODREADS TOTALLY SUCKS!,
Why can't I rate this book a million or billion or even more than trillion of stars rating here on Goodreads?,
WHY?,
WHY?,
WHY?,
Five stars rating is absolutely not enough, solve this problem now, Goodreads!,
Or is there any option to give it that kind of rating?,
If there is, then, send me an owl.FULL REVIEW TO COME.Obviously 5 star .,
Again .,
The illustrations in this edition were absolutely stunning and I can't wait for the rest of them to be out!First read 1997Many many rereadsMost recent reread 2014Dear HarryI have been meaning to write this for a long time now .,
This isnU+2019t a review on your journey, this is simply my feelings and words I wish I could tell you .,
I still remember the first time I bought your first book .,
(I had to buy it again from another publication that actually continued with your books!) I had been without any interesting books to read for months and your book caught my attention since I had read about your popularityFirst read 1997Many many rereadsMost recent reread 2014Dear HarryI have been meaning to write this for a long time now .,
This isnU+2019t a review on your journey, this is simply my feelings and words I wish I could tell you .,
I still remember the first time I bought your first book .,
(I had to buy it again from another publication that actually continued with your books!) I had been without any interesting books to read for months and your book caught my attention since I had read about your popularity in Britain so I got all excited and bought the book immediately .,
People barely knew you where I lived and I can claim I was among the first who gave you a chance .,
At the time, your books werenU+2019t found easily anyway and werenU+2019t published all over the country .,
I read your book and I really liked it but I wasnU+2019t really in love .,
I did look forward to your second book and I was disappointed to find out that there were no copies available where I lived and your third book wasnU+2019t even out yet .,
I waited and waited and slowly word spread about you and the second copy appeared .,
I read it and..something changed .,
I was falling in love.There was a girl in my class that I barely knew .,
I recommended you to her, she read it and something changed between us too .,
More than 10 years later, she is still one of my closest friends .,
Just like that, you helped to connect us.I am not a genius but I found school days very boring .,
I was fine getting good grades without paying any real attention at the classroom and certain days were almost unbearable but then..you became a part of my life and I finally had you and your world to think about .,
I could think and fantasize about you, your journey, your future and I finally had a book to look forward to year after year .,
Time passed and my teenage years were spent with you .,
When I think back, you gave me some of my best memories from that time .,
Then came a time that almost anyone that read books, knew about you .,
I stumbled upon a new site that had been created by kids in my country and I started to talk with one of the admins .,
She was both a Harry Potter fan and a Lord of the Rings fan and we clicked immediately!,
I will never forget how she kept calling me by mobile phone when my family moved into a new house and I didn't have access to phones or Internet .,
She would talk to me for hours and helped me to keep my sanity!,
She moved to Japan a few years ago and I have very little contact with her now, but I will always remember her and what she did for me.Years later, as a university student, I met a pair of twin sisters .,
They were very very shy at the time, or should I say at first contact, and I didnU+2019t know how to connect with them or whether I even wanted to .,
Then we realized we all love you, we started talking about you and then found other things we all liked. .,
and today, they are my best friends, they always try to be there for me and I always try to be there for them .,
We have our differences but we also have our similarities and our love for you is one of them.Harry, thank you for letting me into your world .,
Thank you for becoming a part of my world .,
Thank you for being there when I needed you .,
Thank you for giving me these fun and treasured memories .,
Thank you for helping me find people like me .,
Thank you for everything!,
I will always cherish you.You live forever in my mind and my heart.Yours sincerely*2nd Reread: August 24th 2016.*1st Reread: September 2013.*Read: Someday 2006.I was so excited to enter Hogwarts this year again (Fall is coming soon and this is the best time to re-read the whole series).Hogwarts: a love story!And I wanted to meet my beloved characters, whom I've grown with for so long.Harry, the famous child, who didn't know anything about his family history or Hogwarts until he was 11 years old!,

Dumbledore, the best wizard the history has known ever .,
He was wise but also so brave.Prof .,
Snape, you won't know him well unless you complete the series!(He is my favorite character, always my fav!).And we got to see Prof. Quirrell, the stuttering, most innocent professor you can meet in your life!,

(hide spoiler)]You can't imagine the plot twist in this book, it is so well-done .,
The first time I saw the movie, I was shocked!,
(Yeah, I watched the movies before reading the books, and the books are so much better than the movies, but it helped me a lot in imagining this magic world).Lets leave the characters now, what is this book particularly about?The Philosopher's/sorcerer's stone.What is this?Who owned this stone?Who protects it?Who want to steal it?,
and why?What will happen to the trio?Who is "You-Know-Who"?I won't tell, for sure .,
GO .,

Even if you watched the movies, I am sure you still can enjoy the books so much .,
And you will know these characters better and better.And finally, I NEED THIS TICKET IN MY LIFE!P.S .,

I'm happy that I got to read an illustrated, non-altered version of Harry Potter year 1 .,
It sucks they are only putting out one illustrated version per year .,
So it will be this fall until we see the Chamber of Secrets .,
:(UPDATED: I've already read this, but just finished it a 2nd time reading it to my children; doing all the voices and everything!,
(Note: I finished the ILLUSTRATED VERSION for the 2nd time .,
I've read book 1 & the rest of the series too many times) .,

THEY LOVED IT!,
And now they are fixing to watch the first movie .,
I also found the illustrated version of book 2 "The Chamber of Secrets" (that was just released on 10/4/16) .,
So after they finish the first movie, we will be starting book 2 together!,
My kids are officially little wizards now and in love with the magical world of Harry Potter!,
I'm bouncing off the walls with happiness and can't wait to start book 2 with them!5 Stars..always!No puedo creer todo lo que dure para animarme a leer este libro (culpo a las pelU+00EDculas por eso) es probablemente el mejor inicio de saga que he podido leer, sin duda de ese tipo de historias que te marca para toda la vida, creo que si no hubiera pelU+00EDculas el impacto (al menos en mU+00ED) hubiera sido mU+00E1s grande, pero aU+00FAn y con eso lo ame .,
I wasn't sure if I was going to write a review of these books, but I try to write a review of all of the books that I read, and it's been kind of nagging at me that I didn't write one for this .,
It's hard to write a review for a book that is so dang popular and well known .,
What is there to say that's new?,
I dunno .,
I think pretty much everything's been said, but still I wanted to write a review for this, and to talk about these books, even if I'm just rehashing everything that's already been done.I wasn't sure if I was going to write a review of these books, but I try to write a review of all of the books that I read, and it's been kind of nagging at me that I didn't write one for this .,

I dunno .,
I think pretty much everything's been said, but still I wanted to write a review for this, and to talk about these books, even if I'm just rehashing everything that's already been done .,
I remember when these first came out, I never really wanted to read them .,
I thought of them as "kid's books" and even though I read YA, my overly-critical half just kept saying that these weren't for me .,
I don't know if it was the cover, or the insta-popularity of the books or what, but I didn't read them .,
I avoided them like the plague .,
Until a friend of mine was reading the 5th book, and was so engrossed in it that he would do the "..yes, yes, I'm paying attention.." nod while his eyes remained glued to the page .,
And as a reader myself, I know that look .,
So I asked to borrow the book he was reading, and he refused .,
He told me that if I was going to read it, I'd have to READ it, starting with the first book .,
So the next day, he lent me the first and second books, both of which I finished in record time, and then I understood .,
And I never looked back .,
There's something about these books that is just. .,
magical .,
Yeah, yeah, cliche, I know .,
But it's true .,
Yes, they are about magic, but they are about so much more than that .,
They are about love, and friendship and loyalty and trust and betrayal and commitment and all the things that we aspire to have and to be as humans .,
They are about understanding and forgiveness and learning who we are when it really matters .,
And all of these things are buried in this shell of fun and adventure and mystery that makes them irresistible .,
I decided to read these again in the original UK editions, because I know that the US editions were "Americanized", and I wanted to re-experience them in their true form .,
I dislike when things are changed from their original format, I hate abridgments and condensed versions etc. I want to experience the story how the author wrote it, how it was meant to be experienced without some guy in a suit somewhere trying to make it "accessible" to me .,
I like the feeling that I get of learning something of another culture through the words they use, and the meaning that they give the words .,
This is why they taught us reading comprehension in third grade, so that we can read and LEARN .,
Learning doesn't have to be boring and tedious, it can be fun if we allow it to be .,
But it seems that we've lost that ability .,
Sad .,
Anyway, I re-read the first book, now appropriately titled "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", and I was surprised at how emotional I felt reading it, especially after knowing where it all ends .,
It was like seeing friends that you've missed for years again, and while it makes you happy to see them, it's also sad because you know they'll have to go again too soon .,
That's how I felt, like I was seeing friends and that my time with them is short .,
That's kind of a silly way to feel, because they are forever, and I can visit anytime I want to, but I felt that way anyway .,
Especially meeting Ron again .,
He's my favorite character for an absolute reason, which is because he is so loyal and funny and true, and he gives his whole heart when he gives it at all .,
I wish that there were more people like Ron .,
I can't wait to re-read the rest of the series and see if this feeling remains .,
I love discovering the hidden gems that Rowling has left for us to find, in mythology and history and legend and word-play and in life .,
Who wouldn't love these books?,
This book was given to me by an english chick in a hostel in Central America .,
It was supposed to make me want to read the rest of the catalogue; it did not .,
The worst part of this book is how stupid that stupid wizard game is .,
How do they not realize they should just save their energy until the end when the one ball that wins the game comes into play?,
It is infuriating to me that people play this game on quads across the country, a game that is intended to be played while flying on broomsticks.This book was given to me by an english chick in a hostel in Central America .,

Why do some children's books make some people think they are big readers because they are able to focus on children's literature .,
For my time, I will pick up Roald Dahl any day of the week over this series.Reread 19/04/15So glad I decided to reread this, it was just what I needed to get me out of this weird slump I was in!,
Just as amazing as the first time I read it!!,
J.K Rowling is queen Edit (December 5, 2015):First re-read I've ever done in my life .,
I must say, this book isn't quite the best thing in the world .,
It has many tropes I really hate (speshul snowflake, villain that only wants to take over the world for no reason, etc), but there's something magical about it and all those aspects for some reason make me smile.It's amusing how innocent everything was when it all started .,

Harry Potter is not my favourite series ever, or the one that has affected me the most (that place is saved for The Monstrumologist by Rick Yancey), but certainly it's one of the best and it kind of made my childhood (I grew up with the movies, actually, not with the books, but I was, in any case, attached to the story since a kid) .,
J.K., I'm sorry for saying you're not a goddess in my The Cuckoo's Calling review.______________________There's no way to properly review this thing, so I'm just gonna tell you how I met the Harry Potter series..There was a little girl named Vanessa who always wanted to do the contrary to what people wanted her to do .,
If she had a chore to do, she would do it as long as they let her alone .,
If mom or dad or one of her brothers or her sister or anyone in her family told her to do it, she would immediately refuse, because she takes no orders .,
She's her own boss.As she was like that, then if something was popular, she would not do/read/watch/whatever it .,
Well, there was this particular little series that everyone had read .,
It had movies and everyone loved them.Do you know what she did?,
She promised herself she would never read them .,
She had already watched the movies (the ones that were out) and she rather liked them, but she would not touch the books, because doing so would mean she was just like everyone else, and she was special (yeah, I was that arrogant).Some years later.October 15th, 2011.It was a gray day and it was her brother's birthday .,
Mother wanted to gift his son something that he would enjoy, but not videogames or stuff like that .,
She wanted something with more educational value - say, a book.Mother knew Vanessa's brother liked the HP movies (up until the sixth one), and as there was a book fair at his school (which was mine too), and the books upon which the movies were based were there .,
She bought the first and gave it to his son for his birthday.Some of her mother's friend had also given Vanessa's brother several of the other boks in the series .,
It seemed as if they had planned the whole thing.Of course Vanessa thought there was a hidden purpose there .,
She thought her mother had bought the books so she wouldn't resist on picking them (I told you I was arrogant, didn't I?).She was wrong .,
That was not her mother's purpose, but in the end, Vanessa couldn't resist the pull .,
She wanted and didn't want to read the books.Wanted them for some reasons:U+00B7 She had always been intrigued by them.U+00B7 She was the reader in the house .,
She couldn't stand the fact that her brother (who hated - and still hates - reading) was going to read more books than her (don't even tell me).U+00B7 A "friend" of hers was bragging she had read the HP books in less than one week and she wanted to prove her she could do the same.Didn't want them for some reasons:U+00B7 Reading them would mean she was a common girl (I was an insufferable 13-year-old girl - don't blame me).U+00B7 She would break her promise if she read them.U+00B7 If she read them, she would do what everyone else wanted her to do, and as you know, she hates being told what to do.After a long time of deep philosophizing (aka one day), she decided she would read them .,
What could be the worst thing to happen?It turns out she loved the first book .,
Her reaction upon starting it was something like this:After that, she wanted the next ones .,
She borrowed the books from his brother and read them all up to the 5th one (those were the ones we had) in one week .,
She felt sorry for not doing it any sooner..Yeah, I was and still am like that .,
I'm really glad I decided to read the books .,
They all have amazing plots, fantastic character development, writing that improves over the books, great story and world building, etc. What else can I need?"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling."It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."I love this book, with all my heart .,
That's why this review is so hard to write .,
Who has never heard about Harry Potter, the guy who lived?,
I always say that the The book thief was the first book I have ever read, but then, there's this one .,
That I read sooo long ago, that I didn't remember a single thing about it .,
I know all almost"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling."It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."I love this book, with all my heart .,

That I read sooo long ago, that I didn't remember a single thing about it .,
I know all almost all lines by head because I've watched the movie thousands of times, but there's nothing like reading the book .,
It's like myself talking to my brother after I finished it:Me: Gu, (his name is Gustavo - when we went to the USA, nobody understood his name .,
Is that an unusual name?) did you know that after Ron plays chess, there was another test?,
A potion one?,
My brother: REALLY?,
Why wouldn't they show that at the movie?,
I bet it was amazing, potions and all .,
Hermione solve it, right?,
Imagine if I guessed it correctly like her?,
Me: Don't know, Gus .,
Would you read the book, then?,
There are thousands of things you will only know about HP if you read itMy brother: Nah, I hate reading .,
My point is: like myself before I reread this, my brother and other people who never read this book and only watched the movie will never know the things that also happened .,
LIKE HOW MANY TIMES NEVILLE IS PRESENT ON THE SCENES!,
How Hermione is way geekier, Ginny is SO young, the way Hagrid speaks .,
And still, there are things that never seizes to amaze me about these books: friendship, loyalty, love, magic .,
They are present in every page of this, every scene, every line .,
The way Hermione becomes their friend was always one of the things I liked the most .,
She's so different from Harry and Ron, and still, she fits .,
She learns, she takes risks, she goes with Ron and Harry in their adventures because she is brave, in her own way .,
She has a heart of gold, like my mom used to say, just like Harry .,
"There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."I have to talk about Harry, as well .,
He is just. .,
oh my .,
He is this eleven year old kid who lived with his mean aunt and uncle for his entire existence to discover that he is , actually, a wizard .,
So he goes to this school, finds out is famous and that his parents were killed for one of the best bad wizards out there .,
He doesn't know how to do magic, it's his first time making friends, in an entire new school in a total different environment, and still, he does good .,
Because he's kind, courageous, strong-minded, smart .,
He's an excellent friend, an excellent student .,
(unless when he's not sneaking around lol but still, he does it for the greater good) .,
Harry Potter is not only one of these books you love, it speaks to you .,
It makes you care about people who are not real, and still, you love them .,
You have all the dvds, all the books .,
You watched every movie in the movie theater as soon as they were released .,
It was a tradition, something you waited the whole year for .,
And no, you didn't cry like a baby in the last one .,
Not in Leville's speech, because how has he grown! .,
Not in Snape's scene, not when Harry "dies." And you definitely didn't cry when the movie ended .,
It's just. .,
it's a love for a series that will never die, you know?,
I loved every aspect of this .,
I loved how the movie was as faithful as possible, loved the authors playing these characters so well, loved how different and important each one of them is .,
Snape, Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron, Neville Longbottom, George and Fred, Harry, of course .,
I just can't wait to read the next one and be mesmerized all over again."After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure."It's impossible not to date myself through this review, but I first read Harry Potter when I was young enough to wish for a Hogwarts letter of my own .,
I'm now rereading the exact same hardcovers that I bought as they were released, mostly because my mother is a saint and mailed them all to me in San Francisco:I'm rereading this book while drinking a glass of wine (HA!!), and on this pass I really think it's the optimal children's book .,

It opens an entire world while still following a compact, interesting plot, and it makes me laugh on every single page .,
It's amazing that the Dumbledore who says, at the first feast, "Nitwit!,
Blubber!,
Oddment!,
Tweak!" can be the same person as the Dumbledore of the rest of the series, but somehow that is believable and wonderful .,

It's brilliant!,

On to #2....Obviously a re-read for me.Loved reading this book for the second time and having the illustrated version be the edition to experience it all again .,
Rowling is such a master storyteller .,
Not many writers have achieved creating such beloved characters .,
The illustrations were beautiful and that close to ending scene with Dumbledore is perfection .,
So much love and detail was put into these unique characters .,
Hagrid, I will always love you .,
Rereading this was a good choice!,
I think I'm going to reread this every year to be honest .,
My advice to anyone who hasn't read this?,
READ IT!,
As always, this story feels like coming home.A noteworthy development: This is the first time I've cried reading book one .,
I'm always prepared to cry while reading five and seven, but this was unexpected to say the least, especially given the countless number of times I've read this book .,
The Mirror of Erised scene just really hit me this time around .,
And I really appreciate Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves for making such a faithful film adaptation .,

This book remains pure magic.update: HAHA I just finished this only to have Doc pick it up .,
1/6/16He's only 8 pages in but he already hates the Dursleys more than he already did from watching the films (and lemme tell you, he despised them to begin with) .,
He especially detests Uncle Vernon .,
He also says he never got the vibe from the films of how utterly paranoid they are regarding magic and the Potters.1/13/16He still loves the zoo boa constrictor's "Thankssss, amigo."Also, "YER A WIZARD, HARRY."1/21/16He really gets a kick out of the way Hagrid speaks, he says it sounds like he's from Appalachia -- coming off reading Spencer's Mountain, it seems to be a good grounding point .,
And he picked up on Fantastic Beasts in the list of course books, and liked that I have the little copy of that one downstairs too :) Oh and he says he must not have paid much attention to the movie before, because the twin cores thing between Harry's and Voldy's wands really got his attention .,
Also, George's line: "We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat!" to which I had to respond "George!,
-- Only joking, Mum." And then he just stared at me with the face of Who-even-are-you.I am LOVING this.3/1/16He finished it a few days ago (maybe it's been a week now?) and is on to book two .,
This edition has a sneak peek of the next book in the back, and he started reading that the other night before stopping and saying "Hang on, the second book's downstairs .,

I don't know why it took me so long to start this series but I'm so glad I finally did .,
There are so many scenes in the book that were left out of the movie completely that I'm glad I got to experience by reading the book .,
I can't wait to jump into the second book of Potter's journey!June 2016 - Rereading my all time favorite series is the BEST .,
EVER .,
Even up to this day, it never lose its charm .,
My reading journey started on this series and it will always remained in my heart .,
I feel so nostalgic .,
If you haven't read this series, it's never too late .,

I really don't have any amount of words that I can string together to tell you how this book makes me feel .,
J.K. Rowling will always set the bar for how a series should be written, because Harry Potter is written with love, and it makes all the difference .,
Always.If you'd like to participate in #HARRYXMASTOYOU here is the official Twitter and YouTube Video for more information!,

Este libro me ha emocionado!ReseU+00F1a: http://elmarcapaginas-loco.blogspot.c..I realize many people have said this and many people can express this way better than I can, but I'll try .,
I don't know how many times I've read the books so far in my life (I guess around the 5 times) but every time I start reading this series again I realize why this is my favourite series ever (and I'm 99.9% sure it will be never surpassed) .,
I have tried to explain this to others, but I never quite manage to tell why I love these books so much .,
And I don't know what the Nobel Prize comitee isI realize many people have said this and many people can express this way better than I can, but I'll try .,

And I don't know what the Nobel Prize comitee is thinking but if there is one person who changed the world by books it's J.K. Rowling .,
There are many other really, really good books, but if I try to compare them to Harry Potter it mostly goes sth like this:Books I like:1 .,
Harry Potter2 .,
The other books (Including Percy Jackson, Throne of Glass and The Mortal Instruments) (This is so hard :/ I can't do this)when reading 'normal' books, it often goes as follows:I read one hour, then I go on Goodreads/YouTube/I watch the news/whatever for some time (like an hour), I pick up the book again etc. when I'm reading Harry Potter things go more like this:I read for 3 hours, then I'm like oh I need to check the news, I watch the news for 5 minutes and I'm like but what am I actually doing?,
This is nonsense I'D RATHER BE READING And that makes that I can read 5 pretty big books in just one week and feel like I should have read more .,
And at the same time it makes me ache because I know I've only got two books left .,
AHHHHHHHHHH(time for another reread)There is no way I could EVER write a review for this book, so I'm just going to say a few words and leave it at that  .,
.,
Uploaded with ImageShack.usMy neverending thanks to Litchick for organizing this colossal group read .,
I can't believe it's been 15 years since I last touched these pages .,

Legendary British author, J.K. Rowling's debut novel has gained international acclaim since its initial publication, winning a total of seven awards .,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the magic began .,
The novel begins at the small, quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey where the book's eleven year-old protagonist, Harry Potter, lives in the cupboard under the stairs .,
He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys: Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their son, Dudley .,
His only living relatives treat him poorly, making Harry's childhood miserable.Harry's unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain .,
As the novel unfolds, Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world, befriends other students, and comes face-to-face with adversity .,
The twists and turns, mounting suspense, and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life-changning and unforgettable.Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable, realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses .,
These characters, as some people would say, possess a certain amount of depth .,
Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels .,
Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero: courage, tenacity, and an inclination to protect others .,
Harry is willing to sacrifice everything, including his own life, to ensure the safety of others .,
Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves, whatever the cost.I must admit, Rowling's imagination is extraordinary .,
Her original vision of a young boy sporting a lighting scar who attended boarding school was transformed into a seven book series teeming with the unimaginable .,
Rowling's creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people, magical creatures, and thrilling enchantments .,
The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless .,
No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book.As the plot unfolded, readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series .,
Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook .,
These seemingly insignificant details, however, have a large impact upon later events within the book .,
My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired .,
The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second book.While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone falls under the "Fantasy" genre, Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel, especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome .,
First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrid's three-headed dog, Fluffy .,
The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology; according to legend, Cerberus, a three-headed dog, ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld .,
The only means of subduing Cerberus (and Fluffy, consequently) is the playing of a lyre .,
Additionally, the Hogwarts motto, "Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus," is Latin for "Never tickle a sleeping dragon." Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the series.I am most impressed not with the books themselves, but with the author whose rags-to-riches life story has inspired countless people worldwide .,
J.K. Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire, England .,
She was accepted at the University of Exeter, where she studied Classics .,
She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation, having suffered from multiple sclerosis .,
Several years later, Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter, Jessica .,
The unhappy couple separated 13 months after their marriage .,
Homeless, penniless, and caring for a newborn, Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide .,
We almost lost the brilliant, talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon .,
Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations .,
Despite her challenges, Rowling's perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to life.Overall, this series is the most memorable from my childhood .,
I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters, suspenseful plot, and flawless writing style .,
I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater, eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis .,
For Halloween last year, in fact, I dressed up in an old pair of robes, pulled on a wig, and drew a scar on my forehead .,
And to this day, I find myself reciting quotes from the series .,
I was crushed after the release of the final book, feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series .,
Looking back, I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series, committing it to memory .,
The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time; it has helped to shape the person I am today.There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,
Let's be honest here .,
If you're reading my reviews and haven't read this series, you're probably an adult, which means two things .,
One is that you have lived through this series releasing 7 novels, 8 movies, and becoming a cultural phenomenon .,
If you're here, you felt that societal pressure to read this, or one of your friends won't shut up until you do (probably) .,
There is little chance the hype can withstand reality .,
And that is partly because.There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,

you aren't eleven years old .,
This book is written for children .,
Yes, the books get darker and more mature (and much better) later on, but this one is for middle school aged kids.This is my first time rereading book 1 in at least 6 years .,
This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book .,
The main characters are dumb, the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment, and in order for some events to make any sense, one has to create their own head-canon .,
Typically at such points, I stop, remind myself that this is a children's book, and get a glass of Maker's 46.But forgive them I do .,
Rowling creates a fantastic world, characters, and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it .,
If I were reading this for the first time today, I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me .,
But I do know that having read the rest of the series, it didn't even cross my mind not to finish this reread, despite seeing all of the problems .,
The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry, so while we never get adult novels, we do get much "better" writing in later books .,
If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off, I encourage you to keep going for another couple of books.As a final note, my rating for this book is for the series .,
I can't honestly rate this book by itself at this point.I first picked up The Philosopher's Stone about seven years ago .,
I'd gone from reading true crime and biographies, to having just finished the Twilight saga, when the Harry Potter series was recommended to me .,
From memory I think I read the first two chapters and then put it down .,
It felt really young and I felt it just wasn't for me .,
So I moved on .,
After starting my IG account I was constantly bombarded with people telling me how amazing the series was and how I had to read it .,

I'm not even sure why I decided to give it another try, but I did .,
And it just goes to show that even if a book is not meant for you when you first pick it up, it doesn't mean that at another time it won't be something that you love .,
Because this book. .,
This book was brilliant!,
It was enchanting and captivating and magical .,
I was completely engrossed from the very first page .,
I absolutely adored the friendship between Harry and Ron, and the dynamic was completed once Hermione was accepted into the little group .,
And Hermione, boy she was awesome!,
She had me grinning from ear to ear .,
I'm so intrigued by Snape, and I can't wait to peel back all his layers to see what he has hidden .,
And then there's the gentle giant that is Hagrid .,
My heart is so full of love for him .,
My favourite character so far!,
I can't tell you how incredibly happy I am to have given this series a second chance .,
I can now officially say I'm well on my way to being a Potterhead!,
Because everyone on the planet excluding me and maybe some of the Kardashians have read this series, I'll skip the plot summary and go for a less formal review .,
I can see why so many people adore Harry Potter .,

Each of the characters has a distinct personality, and Rowling's simple writing style leaves room for brevity and enough imagery to pull you into the setting .,
Story-wise, she includes all of the necessary s: foreshadowing, conflicts that escalate to the climax, a pretty satisfying plot twist, etc.I'll probably read one other book in between each installment of this series .,
I'm looking forward to seeing the characters mature and the plot become darker as many others have said it will!Rereading this magical book with these beautiful illustrations was such a new experience .,
Generally I had so much fun rereading this because I discovered so many little details I hadn't noticed the first time .,
But this new excitement of a page turner was amazing .,
I was so excited to see if there was going to be an illustration on the next page and how it would look like .,
Highly recommend .,

So I've watched almost all the movies and then at a certain point I stopped and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch the last three movies, not until I would have read the series. .,
Well after 14 years I've finally had the courage to start this Saga and I'm so ashamed that I've waited so long. .,
This book is adorable, perfect, I loved it!!!,
And I've already started the second one!!!,
Have to make up for all the years I've lost!,

-----Dopo quattordici anni sono finalmente riuscita a trovare il "coraggio" per iniziare questa saga .,
Eh si, coraggio .,
Dopo il trauma subito da piccola avevo paura di riprendere questo testo .,
Ogni volta che pensavo alla saga di Harry Potter mi rivedevo piccola, seduta accanto alla mia professoressa d'inglese che mi invitava a leggere e cerchiare tutte le parole che non comprendevo (che erano tantissime, considerando che ero appena uscita da ESL - classe per alunni stranieri nelle scuole americane - da pochissimo) .,
E quindi successivamente non ho mai piU+00F9 voluto saperne di HARRY POTTER!,
Dannazione!!!!,
. .,
quanto mi pento di non aver trovato il coraggio prima. .,
per fortuna Harry Potter U+00E8 in grado di stupire non solo i bambini!!!,
Dopo un paio di mesi dalla lettura del testo la scuola ci portU+00F2 a vedere il nuovo film di Harry Potter al cinema, ma che dire. .,
il film mi rapU+00EC completamente .,
Non vi era nessuno che mi osservava, solo io ed Harry .,
Ed iniziai a vedere anche i film successivi .,
Ma poi dopo il quarto mi imposi di fermarmi .,
Dovevo leggere la Saga di Harry Potter!,
. .,
beh dopo tanti anni eccomi qui!!!,
Harry forgive me!!!,
But I'm all yours now. .,
ready to fly to Hogwarts with you!Questo libro U+00E8 dolcissimo!!!,
Harry, Ron, Hermione. .,
ohhh can't wait to see how the love between the two grows!!!,
che non stanca mai, che ti tiene incollata alle pagine!,
Un testo davvero unico, con protagonisti straordinari. .,
e sto solo all'inizio!,
Non vedo l'ora di continuare. .,
beh in realtU+00E0 giU+00E0 sto leggendo il secondo!,
Misteri, magia, amici, nemici, incanti, scope volanti, pozioni, intrighi, lotte,, tanti ingredienti squisiti che non possono non suscitare una forte emozione .,
Amore .,
STUPENDO!!!I need more!!!!Ok, so this was my first time reading this book (don't judge me) .,
While I wasn't quite as enamored with it as the thousands of adoring fans (the ones who have read them over and over and over) have been, this wasn't a bad read .,
I did have to keep reminding myself that this was a children's book, and I'm WAY past the target age!,
My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,

My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,
I'm actually looking forward to reading the rest of the books, just to see how the books, and the characters, grow up .,
I haven't seen the movies, but I don't live under a rock either, and I know that each book progressively ages with the characters, turning from children's books with child-like problems, to books with adult issues and adult responses from the characters .,
I'm really hoping that things in the next books aren't so easy for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to solve .,
That's probably my biggest complaint, and why it "only" got four stars from me: everything was too easy, that the mysteries were laid out too simply and were easily solved .,
They were clever, and again, I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't written with me in mind.This first book was entertaining, as I've said, but it wasn't a five-star read (I'm going to be in trouble for that statement, I think!) .,
It reminded me of a mash-up between the old Hardy Boysancy Drew books (kids solving crimes with skills well beyond their age or abilities) and Scooby-Doo .,
Yes, Scooby-Doo!,
Especially at the end when the real bad guy was revealed (it wasn't who they thought it was), and the bad guy's reaction was, "Darn you, meddling kids!" (or something very similar) .,
:DOn to the next book!I started reading this for the Nth time 3 days before the death of Alan Rickman, who played Snape in the adaptations- in my opinion the best thing about them .,
It was sad, heartbreaking really, to think of his character just beginning his journey again for me through this reading, while the man who played him so excellently had just passed away .,
I love the adventure and magic of these books, but I especially love the journey we take with Snape's character .,
He is everything .,

[re-read August 2015] I won't write a full review, since pretty much everyone knows how this book goes!,
I'm just amazed by the amount of foreshadowing!,
JK Rowling must have exactly known how the story would evolve .,
I don't mind that this book is short, when I think of OOTP for example, I find the beginning (before they go to Hogwarts) too long and often boring. .,

It wasn't as fun after Order of the Phoenix and the bitching commenced .,
Yeah, there were problems .,
But I'm not organized, I don't wanna die, and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff.I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire .,
(So it wasn't the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was -then- Elijah Wood before he was uglier.) What made me want to read them?,
The Dursleys .,
I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious (they are hilarious .,

Yes!,

No, not the mythology references .,
Yaaay she read Shakespeare .,
My Uncle Remus did too .,
Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series (I do love that) .,
I loved the Aberforth goat stuff .,
I loved the names of Lockhart's books (Gadding with Ghouls, Year with the Yeti, etc.) and the little humor stuff she slips in .,
I can still quote asshole-y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with (Potter stinks!) and can't remember the basic plot twists .,
I was a card carrying Potterite (laminated!) .,

I do miss wondering what was going to happen next .,

I'd go on my favorite Harry forum and have fun making up theories (I was right about EVERYYTHING *coughs*) .,
I'm jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind .,
Yeah, I've got my own stories .,
But I don't think I have as much fun with mine (probably because I'm not a sadistic murderer like she is) .,
I liked the books better before they grew up .,
Rowling couldn't write a love story for anything .,
I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry .,
My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together .,
I love the togetherness .,
(Aberforth was eventually important in the last book .,
That almost ruined it.)P.s .,
In case I didn't look dorky enough. .,
I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans .,
They were all like: "Americans are so dumb that you don't understand what Philosopher means." I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions, JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place (it doesn't mean Just Kidding .,
The publishers thought boys wouldn't read a female author), and their effing ugly covers (English kids lose so often .,
No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken's books!) .,
I did know that jumper meant sweater .,
It's not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle.I found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,
When they were released there were not a lot of children's books that were set in the world of magic .,
I think for me the greatest thing about this book is, it teaches children and adults alike that, you can achieve anything you wish even when you think that it is impossible .,
I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughoutI found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,

I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughout the book, she is more of a straight-laced student but she befriends Ron and Harry .,
She tells them it is to keep them out of trouble, but I believe deep down she is actually happy that she has found people that like a bit of adventure, it is something new to her .,
One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is, why Harry was left with the Dursley's after the death of his parents .,
Although it is clear that Harry is not treated very well at all, I think this was the best place for Harry to grow up .,
Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability, they teach Harry a very valuable lesson..kindness, when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts, he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursley's .,
They also have taught him how to stand up for himself when he is taunted by Draco Malfoy.Rowling has the ability to create a world that every reader of these books wishes to enter and never leave .,
With owls that deliver the mail, a magical school where anything is possible and lets not forget the moving pictures, Hogwarts is a place that will live in the hearts of fans for years to come .,
All and all a great start to what looks like a fantastic series .,
If you are a fan of all things magical and have not delved into the world of Harry Potter yet, I would highly recommend you give this series a chance.I'm a huge fantasy reader , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story bI'm a huge fantasy reader U+26AF U+035B , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story begins with Harry living with his uncle Dursley after Hogwarts send thousands of messages for Harry, Hagrid finally comes to take Harry with him to Hogwarts and Harry got to know about how he's parents really died and they're stories oh and he got to know he's a wizard too!,

Like the centaurs talking about the innocent being the first to die?,
And just so many things just mentioned that come up later, the dragon in Gringotts, Dittany, Sirius Black, Etc.There's also a lot of things I've forgotten weren't in the movie, which is crazy!,
But so good .,
I love it just as much IF NOT EVEN MORE.This is such a wonderful read!!,
I always love rereading Harry Potter but with the illustrations it just added so much to the story that you get new surprises through the images while reading!,
This is just fantastic!,
Finally I would be doing a review of the book that made me plunge into the wonderland of texts.Catch you soon on this space .,

Having suffered through so many years of school required reading, I couldnU+2019t look at a book without thinking of essays!,
Not to mention my distaste for writing at the time .,
All that changed however, with one book that was so magnificent, it must have been a gift from God!,
It completely altered my view of books .,
What was this holy novel, you might be asking?,
U+2026It wasnU+2019t Harry Potter .,
It was The Hunger Games .,
As my eyes were opened to the Young Adult genre, my love of reading began .,
Shortly after reading The Hunger Games, I made a deal with my friend, who passionately loved the Harry Potter books and had been trying to get me to read them for quite some time .,
If she read the first Hunger Games book, IU+2019d read the first Harry Potter book .,
Flash forward a few months, and wouldnU+2019t you know it, my friend read the whole trilogy!,
Did I breeze through all seven Harry Potter books in a week?,
HAHAHAHAHA, NO.You want to know the best part?,
That was 3 years agoU+2026I had been hearing about Harry Potter since I knew how to read, but really disliked the concept of it .,
It's just about some stupid boy who goes to a school for wizards!,
Also, I've heard it rips off Lord of the Rings, so I'm going to stay as far away from it as possible..See, the funny thing about this is, I actually knew nothing about Harry Potter .,
Nothing .,
Zip .,
Nada .,
I hadn't even seen more than 5 minutes of the movies!,
*gasps* After having a hundred or so people threatening me to read it, out of fear for my life, I complied .,
I certainly am glad I did .,
It was incredible!,
Absolutely stupendous!,
The Characters "So light a fire!" Harry choked .,
"Yes..of course..but there's no wood!""HAVE YOU GONE MAD!" Ron bellowed .,
"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT!,
Harry.Undoubtedly, my favorite part of this beautiful book was its beautiful characters .,
Harry, Hermione, Ron, Fred, George..I love them all!,
Ironically, Harry was my least favorite of the trio .,
Not that I didn't like him, but he just didn't have as distinct of a personality as Hermione and Ron .,
However, I still admired his loyalty and selflessness .,
I'm really excited to see how his character develops throughout the series.Hermione.Is it bad if I see a lot of myself in Hermione?,
Haha .,
I can be the occasional smart-alec who gets all up in your business..so, naturally, I love Hermione Granger .,
She wasn't a Mary Sue!,
She was intelligent, loyal, and feisty!,
There really should be more heroines like her .,
I also have brown hair, brown eyes, and am Muggle-born..We're practically the same person.Ron.He was pretty great too .,
Having four siblings (two of which, are twins), I can relate to him .,
Ron and Hermione's bickering was positively priceless, and he had more than a few memorable remarks .,
He was the comedy relief of the whole book, and it wouldn't be the same without him.Malfoy .,
I was really hoping this little git would get devoured by Fluffy.Other characters .,
Hagrid, was hilarious, and is it strange if I am particularly fond of Hedwig?,
Dumbledore didn't really have that much screen time, so I don't really know what to think of him..yet .,
My favorite, or should I say favorites, are definitely Gred and Froge .,
*wink* I swear, I was cracking up over every dialogue they had .,
As a matter of fact, I loved all the Weasleys .,
U+201CNow, you two U+2013 this year, you behave yourselves .,
If I get one more owl telling me you've U+2013 you've blown up a toilet or U+2013""Blown up a toilet?,
We've never blown up a toilet.""Great idea though, thanks, Mum.U+201D The World Building I finally see why everyone admires J.K. Rowling .,
Hogwarts and the wizard world she creates is whimsically ingenious .,
Honestly, why can't Quidditch be a real sport?,
It's fantastic!,
I want to ride a broom stick and hit flying balls into peoples' faces!,
All flavor jelly beans?,
How awesome is that?,
Apparently, you can buy them from Amazon..including earwax flavor (Eww, wasn't licorice bad enough?) .,
I'm not kidding, look it up!,
Rowling did a marvelous job of luring me into Potter's world .,
The only aspect of the universe that puzzles me, is where exactly is Hogwarts?,
Is it in a different universe from our reality?,
If so, how are Harry and Ron (I started a wee bit on Chamber of Secrets..as soon as I finished this one) able to fly a car there?!,
What I Loved U+269C The protagonist and side characters .,
Lovely, lovely, lovely characters .,
Rowling did a spectacular job of creating such a hilarious and realistic cast.U+269C The plot was highly entertaining .,
Though a little short, Harry and his friends' adventure was incredibly entertaining and I am especially curious about what other secrets Hogwarts holds..U+269C Rowling's writing was pleasant and engaging .,
A little simple, yes, but short and sweet .,
What else should I expect from a Middle Grade novel?U+269C The plot twist in the end .,
I'm not going to lie, I felt quite childish that I didn't see it coming .,
It was so obvious, yet I was too busy laughing over Harry swallowing Quidditch balls to notice what was right in front of me.U+269C The villains .,
*claps* Well done, Rowling .,
Well done .,
What I Didn't Love U+269C The pacing .,
A short novel?,
Understandable .,
An abrupt ending?,
Inexcusable .,
Final Thoughts I hope all you Muggles are happy now!,
I finally did it!Harry Potter was so wonderful!,
I really should've read it all those years ago .,
The characters were exceptional, story incredible, writing amiable..honestly, what else can I say, other than it truly was a magical book .,
I'll absolutely be finishing this series .,
:)WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .,
THIS IS EPIC .,
FUCKING EPIC .,
_____________________________________________________________Guys my little sister just came put to me with this book in her hand and asked if I wanted to BR with her .,
She looked so happy when I said yes .,
It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,
I'd heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon, but still I didn't feel compelled to read the books .,
I've been reader all my life but I don't know, I was kinda undecided about it .,
Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watchingIt was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,

Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watching the films, so what may I am losing about the story (oh boy!,
how wrong I was!) .,
I had some good surprises because I wasn't reading the books like in the third movie .,
When I watched the fourth film, Goblet of Fire, I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book BUT it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books .,
Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish, he had an edition on English of the first book, this one, and since by then I already was reading on English, he lent me the book .,
Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books .,
I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that it's not mine, still I don't want to have books, etc. .,
that are not mine under my care .,
Still, my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish .,
Since I wasn't SO convinced to read the books, I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book .,
I started to reading it. .,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Right in the first pages, when Hagrid mentioned WHO lent him out the flying motorcycle!!!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Keep on mind that I already watched 4 films by then, so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle, mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Then, I knew that J.K. Rowling was a wicked genius!!!,
And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book, since certain character that appears in the first book, then I said "Oh, boy, what a boring chapter, why did J.K. bothered to create such unimportant character?" and I was starting to read the fifth book and. .,
"Mmh. .,
where I heard about this character before..where?..mmmh..OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
NO!!!,
IT CAN'T BE!!!" .,
By then, I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW!,
Yes, it was the same character!!!,
Right in the first book!!!,
So, re-confirmed like for the umpteenth time. .,
J.K. Rowling is a wicked genius!!!,
I enjoyed a lot reading the first book .,
J.K. Rowling has a very interesting style of writing .,
Also, the first book is very good combining the magical world with the normal things that people has to do when kids are beginning school .,
Going to buy the school supplies .,
Having to deal different kind of teachers .,
Some good, some strict, some both .,
The forming of friendships with schoolmates .,
Indeed a wonderful and magical book .,
Highly recommended.I absolutely adore this new edition of Harry Potter and I hope that they will make illustrated versions of all of the books (although they might get quite big..) Getting to experience this story once again, after not having read the book for a long time and this time with beautiful illustrations to complement the story was a truly magnificent experience .,
J.K. Rowling is the queen!!Harry Potter is and will always be one of my all time favorite series First book down for readalong!,
Doesn't matter how many times I read these books, they're always just as amazing as the first time around!,
So amazing!,
I realize many people have said this and many people can express this way better than I can, but I'll try .,
I don't know how many times I've read the books so far in my life (I guess around the 5 times) but every time I start reading this series again I realize why this is my favourite series ever (and I'm 99.9% sure it will be never surpassed) .,
I have tried to explain this to others, but I never quite manage to tell why I love these books so much .,
And I don't know what the Nobel Prize comitee isI realize many people have said this and many people can express this way better than I can, but I'll try .,

And I don't know what the Nobel Prize comitee is thinking but if there is one person who changed the world by books it's J.K. Rowling .,
There are many other really, really good books, but if I try to compare them to Harry Potter it mostly goes sth like this:Books I like:1 .,
Harry Potter2 .,
The other books (Including Percy Jackson, Throne of Glass and The Mortal Instruments) (This is so hard :/ I can't do this)when reading 'normal' books, it often goes as follows:I read one hour, then I go on Goodreads/YouTube/I watch the news/whatever for some time (like an hour), I pick up the book again etc. when I'm reading Harry Potter things go more like this:I read for 3 hours, then I'm like oh I need to check the news, I watch the news for 5 minutes and I'm like but what am I actually doing?,
This is nonsense I'D RATHER BE READING And that makes that I can read 5 pretty big books in just one week and feel like I should have read more .,
And at the same time it makes me ache because I know I've only got two books left .,
AHHHHHHHHHH(time for another reread)There is no way I could EVER write a review for this book, so I'm just going to say a few words and leave it at that  .,
.,
Uploaded with ImageShack.usMy neverending thanks to Litchick for organizing this colossal group read .,
I can't believe it's been 15 years since I last touched these pages .,

Legendary British author, J.K. Rowling's debut novel has gained international acclaim since its initial publication, winning a total of seven awards .,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the magic began .,
The novel begins at the small, quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey where the book's eleven year-old protagonist, Harry Potter, lives in the cupboard under the stairs .,
He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys: Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their son, Dudley .,
His only living relatives treat him poorly, making Harry's childhood miserable.Harry's unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain .,
As the novel unfolds, Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world, befriends other students, and comes face-to-face with adversity .,
The twists and turns, mounting suspense, and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life-changning and unforgettable.Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable, realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses .,
These characters, as some people would say, possess a certain amount of depth .,
Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels .,
Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero: courage, tenacity, and an inclination to protect others .,
Harry is willing to sacrifice everything, including his own life, to ensure the safety of others .,
Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves, whatever the cost.I must admit, Rowling's imagination is extraordinary .,
Her original vision of a young boy sporting a lighting scar who attended boarding school was transformed into a seven book series teeming with the unimaginable .,
Rowling's creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people, magical creatures, and thrilling enchantments .,
The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless .,
No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book.As the plot unfolded, readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series .,
Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook .,
These seemingly insignificant details, however, have a large impact upon later events within the book .,
My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired .,
The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second book.While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone falls under the "Fantasy" genre, Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel, especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome .,
First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrid's three-headed dog, Fluffy .,
The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology; according to legend, Cerberus, a three-headed dog, ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld .,
The only means of subduing Cerberus (and Fluffy, consequently) is the playing of a lyre .,
Additionally, the Hogwarts motto, "Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus," is Latin for "Never tickle a sleeping dragon." Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the series.I am most impressed not with the books themselves, but with the author whose rags-to-riches life story has inspired countless people worldwide .,
J.K. Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire, England .,
She was accepted at the University of Exeter, where she studied Classics .,
She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation, having suffered from multiple sclerosis .,
Several years later, Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter, Jessica .,
The unhappy couple separated 13 months after their marriage .,
Homeless, penniless, and caring for a newborn, Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide .,
We almost lost the brilliant, talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon .,
Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations .,
Despite her challenges, Rowling's perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to life.Overall, this series is the most memorable from my childhood .,
I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters, suspenseful plot, and flawless writing style .,
I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater, eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis .,
For Halloween last year, in fact, I dressed up in an old pair of robes, pulled on a wig, and drew a scar on my forehead .,
And to this day, I find myself reciting quotes from the series .,
I was crushed after the release of the final book, feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series .,
Looking back, I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series, committing it to memory .,
The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time; it has helped to shape the person I am today.There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,
Let's be honest here .,
If you're reading my reviews and haven't read this series, you're probably an adult, which means two things .,
One is that you have lived through this series releasing 7 novels, 8 movies, and becoming a cultural phenomenon .,
If you're here, you felt that societal pressure to read this, or one of your friends won't shut up until you do (probably) .,
There is little chance the hype can withstand reality .,
And that is partly because.There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,

you aren't eleven years old .,
This book is written for children .,
Yes, the books get darker and more mature (and much better) later on, but this one is for middle school aged kids.This is my first time rereading book 1 in at least 6 years .,
This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book .,
The main characters are dumb, the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment, and in order for some events to make any sense, one has to create their own head-canon .,
Typically at such points, I stop, remind myself that this is a children's book, and get a glass of Maker's 46.But forgive them I do .,
Rowling creates a fantastic world, characters, and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it .,
If I were reading this for the first time today, I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me .,
But I do know that having read the rest of the series, it didn't even cross my mind not to finish this reread, despite seeing all of the problems .,
The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry, so while we never get adult novels, we do get much "better" writing in later books .,
If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off, I encourage you to keep going for another couple of books.As a final note, my rating for this book is for the series .,
I can't honestly rate this book by itself at this point.I first picked up The Philosopher's Stone about seven years ago .,
I'd gone from reading true crime and biographies, to having just finished the Twilight saga, when the Harry Potter series was recommended to me .,
From memory I think I read the first two chapters and then put it down .,
It felt really young and I felt it just wasn't for me .,
So I moved on .,
After starting my IG account I was constantly bombarded with people telling me how amazing the series was and how I had to read it .,

And it just goes to show that even if a book is not meant for you when you first pick it up, it doesn't mean that at another time it won't be something that you love .,
Because this book. .,
This book was brilliant!,
It was enchanting and captivating and magical .,
I was completely engrossed from the very first page .,
I absolutely adored the friendship between Harry and Ron, and the dynamic was completed once Hermione was accepted into the little group .,
And Hermione, boy she was awesome!,
She had me grinning from ear to ear .,
I'm so intrigued by Snape, and I can't wait to peel back all his layers to see what he has hidden .,
And then there's the gentle giant that is Hagrid .,
My heart is so full of love for him .,
My favourite character so far!,
I can't tell you how incredibly happy I am to have given this series a second chance .,
I can now officially say I'm well on my way to being a Potterhead!,
Because everyone on the planet excluding me and maybe some of the Kardashians have read this series, I'll skip the plot summary and go for a less formal review .,
I can see why so many people adore Harry Potter .,

Harry is the underdog from the start and you can't help but cheer him on as he overcomes obstacles with the help of his friends and his mentor .,
Each of the characters has a distinct personality, and Rowling's simple writing style leaves room for brevity and enough imagery to pull you into the setting .,
Story-wise, she includes all of the necessary s: foreshadowing, conflicts that escalate to the climax, a pretty satisfying plot twist, etc.I'll probably read one other book in between each installment of this series .,
I'm looking forward to seeing the characters mature and the plot become darker as many others have said it will!Rereading this magical book with these beautiful illustrations was such a new experience .,
Generally I had so much fun rereading this because I discovered so many little details I hadn't noticed the first time .,
But this new excitement of a page turner was amazing .,
I was so excited to see if there was going to be an illustration on the next page and how it would look like .,
Highly recommend .,

after a couple of months the first movie was out and the school brought us to movie theater to watch it and I actually fell in love with the movie!,
So I've watched almost all the movies and then at a certain point I stopped and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch the last three movies, not until I would have read the series. .,
Well after 14 years I've finally had the courage to start this Saga and I'm so ashamed that I've waited so long. .,
This book is adorable, perfect, I loved it!!!,
And I've already started the second one!!!,
Have to make up for all the years I've lost!,
D: But I've chosen to read it in my language, italian ;). .,
It's funny how a bad memory can influence you .,
Stupid Me!!!,
I almost risked never reading this wonderful saga.. .,

She has bewitched me completely!!!!!!Me after reading Harry Potter!,
-----Dopo quattordici anni sono finalmente riuscita a trovare il "coraggio" per iniziare questa saga .,
Eh si, coraggio .,
Dopo il trauma subito da piccola avevo paura di riprendere questo testo .,
Ogni volta che pensavo alla saga di Harry Potter mi rivedevo piccola, seduta accanto alla mia professoressa d'inglese che mi invitava a leggere e cerchiare tutte le parole che non comprendevo (che erano tantissime, considerando che ero appena uscita da ESL - classe per alunni stranieri nelle scuole americane - da pochissimo) .,
E quindi successivamente non ho mai piU+00F9 voluto saperne di HARRY POTTER!,
Dannazione!!!!,
. .,
quanto mi pento di non aver trovato il coraggio prima. .,
per fortuna Harry Potter U+00E8 in grado di stupire non solo i bambini!!!,
Dopo un paio di mesi dalla lettura del testo la scuola ci portU+00F2 a vedere il nuovo film di Harry Potter al cinema, ma che dire. .,
il film mi rapU+00EC completamente .,
Non vi era nessuno che mi osservava, solo io ed Harry .,
Ed iniziai a vedere anche i film successivi .,
Ma poi dopo il quarto mi imposi di fermarmi .,
Dovevo leggere la Saga di Harry Potter!,
. .,
beh dopo tanti anni eccomi qui!!!,
Harry forgive me!!!,
But I'm all yours now. .,
ready to fly to Hogwarts with you!Questo libro U+00E8 dolcissimo!!!,
Harry, Ron, Hermione. .,
ohhh can't wait to see how the love between the two grows!!!,
che non stanca mai, che ti tiene incollata alle pagine!,
Un testo davvero unico, con protagonisti straordinari. .,
e sto solo all'inizio!,
Non vedo l'ora di continuare. .,
beh in realtU+00E0 giU+00E0 sto leggendo il secondo!,
Misteri, magia, amici, nemici, incanti, scope volanti, pozioni, intrighi, lotte,, tanti ingredienti squisiti che non possono non suscitare una forte emozione .,
Amore .,
STUPENDO!!!I need more!!!!Ok, so this was my first time reading this book (don't judge me) .,
While I wasn't quite as enamored with it as the thousands of adoring fans (the ones who have read them over and over and over) have been, this wasn't a bad read .,
I did have to keep reminding myself that this was a children's book, and I'm WAY past the target age!,
My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,

My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,
I'm actually looking forward to reading the rest of the books, just to see how the books, and the characters, grow up .,
I haven't seen the movies, but I don't live under a rock either, and I know that each book progressively ages with the characters, turning from children's books with child-like problems, to books with adult issues and adult responses from the characters .,
I'm really hoping that things in the next books aren't so easy for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to solve .,
That's probably my biggest complaint, and why it "only" got four stars from me: everything was too easy, that the mysteries were laid out too simply and were easily solved .,
They were clever, and again, I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't written with me in mind.This first book was entertaining, as I've said, but it wasn't a five-star read (I'm going to be in trouble for that statement, I think!) .,
It reminded me of a mash-up between the old Hardy Boysancy Drew books (kids solving crimes with skills well beyond their age or abilities) and Scooby-Doo .,
Yes, Scooby-Doo!,
Especially at the end when the real bad guy was revealed (it wasn't who they thought it was), and the bad guy's reaction was, "Darn you, meddling kids!" (or something very similar) .,
:DOn to the next book!I started reading this for the Nth time 3 days before the death of Alan Rickman, who played Snape in the adaptations- in my opinion the best thing about them .,
It was sad, heartbreaking really, to think of his character just beginning his journey again for me through this reading, while the man who played him so excellently had just passed away .,
I love the adventure and magic of these books, but I especially love the journey we take with Snape's character .,
He is everything .,

[re-read August 2015] I won't write a full review, since pretty much everyone knows how this book goes!,
I'm just amazed by the amount of foreshadowing!,
JK Rowling must have exactly known how the story would evolve .,
I don't mind that this book is short, when I think of OOTP for example, I find the beginning (before they go to Hogwarts) too long and often boring. .,

Of course, I've seen all the movies, but I'm ready to live the magic of the actual books .,

The goats are eating all the flowers and they sure smell experimental pretty .,
It wasn't as fun after Order of the Phoenix and the bitching commenced .,
Yeah, there were problems .,
But I'm not organized, I don't wanna die, and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff.I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire .,
(So it wasn't the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was -then- Elijah Wood before he was uglier.) What made me want to read them?,
The Dursleys .,
I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious (they are hilarious .,
I love it when Vernon tells everyone that Harry attends "St .,
Brutus' Center for Incurably Criminal Boys" .,
His Japanese golfer joke .,
When playing trivia games with friends I'd piss myself with excitement if I got a muggle question .,
"Vernon's drill company is called Grunnings!,
Yes!,
I'm more amazing than all of you put together!" Wonder why no one plays reindeer games with me anymore..) I love muggles.I loved the stupid shit .,
No, not the mythology references .,
Yaaay she read Shakespeare .,
My Uncle Remus did too .,
Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series (I do love that) .,
I loved the Aberforth goat stuff .,
I loved the names of Lockhart's books (Gadding with Ghouls, Year with the Yeti, etc.) and the little humor stuff she slips in .,
I can still quote asshole-y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with (Potter stinks!) and can't remember the basic plot twists .,
I was a card carrying Potterite (laminated!) .,
Sigh .,
I do miss wondering what was going to happen next .,
I miss having that place to retreat to in my mind .,
I'd go on my favorite Harry forum and have fun making up theories (I was right about EVERYYTHING *coughs*) .,
I'm jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind .,
Yeah, I've got my own stories .,
But I don't think I have as much fun with mine (probably because I'm not a sadistic murderer like she is) .,
I liked the books better before they grew up .,
Rowling couldn't write a love story for anything .,
I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry .,
My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together .,
I love the togetherness .,
(Aberforth was eventually important in the last book .,
That almost ruined it.)P.s .,
In case I didn't look dorky enough. .,
I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans .,
They were all like: "Americans are so dumb that you don't understand what Philosopher means." I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions, JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place (it doesn't mean Just Kidding .,
The publishers thought boys wouldn't read a female author), and their effing ugly covers (English kids lose so often .,
No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken's books!) .,
I did know that jumper meant sweater .,
It's not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle.I found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,
When they were released there were not a lot of children's books that were set in the world of magic .,
I think for me the greatest thing about this book is, it teaches children and adults alike that, you can achieve anything you wish even when you think that it is impossible .,
I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughoutI found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,

She tells them it is to keep them out of trouble, but I believe deep down she is actually happy that she has found people that like a bit of adventure, it is something new to her .,
One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is, why Harry was left with the Dursley's after the death of his parents .,
Although it is clear that Harry is not treated very well at all, I think this was the best place for Harry to grow up .,
Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability, they teach Harry a very valuable lesson..kindness, when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts, he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursley's .,
They also have taught him how to stand up for himself when he is taunted by Draco Malfoy.Rowling has the ability to create a world that every reader of these books wishes to enter and never leave .,
With owls that deliver the mail, a magical school where anything is possible and lets not forget the moving pictures, Hogwarts is a place that will live in the hearts of fans for years to come .,
All and all a great start to what looks like a fantastic series .,
If you are a fan of all things magical and have not delved into the world of Harry Potter yet, I would highly recommend you give this series a chance.I'm a huge fantasy reader , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story bI'm a huge fantasy reader U+26AF U+035B , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story begins with Harry living with his uncle Dursley after Hogwarts send thousands of messages for Harry, Hagrid finally comes to take Harry with him to Hogwarts and Harry got to know about how he's parents really died and they're stories oh and he got to know he's a wizard too!,

Ironically, Harry was my least favorite of the trio .,
Not that I didn't like him, but he just didn't have as distinct of a personality as Hermione and Ron .,
However, I still admired his loyalty and selflessness .,
I'm really excited to see how his character develops throughout the series.Hermione.Is it bad if I see a lot of myself in Hermione?,
Haha .,
I can be the occasional smart-alec who gets all up in your business..so, naturally, I love Hermione Granger .,
She wasn't a Mary Sue!,
She was intelligent, loyal, and feisty!,
There really should be more heroines like her .,
I also have brown hair, brown eyes, and am Muggle-born..We're practically the same person.Ron.He was pretty great too .,
Having four siblings (two of which, are twins), I can relate to him .,
Ron and Hermione's bickering was positively priceless, and he had more than a few memorable remarks .,
He was the comedy relief of the whole book, and it wouldn't be the same without him.Malfoy .,
I was really hoping this little git would get devoured by Fluffy.Other characters .,
Hagrid, was hilarious, and is it strange if I am particularly fond of Hedwig?,
Dumbledore didn't really have that much screen time, so I don't really know what to think of him..yet .,
My favorite, or should I say favorites, are definitely Gred and Froge .,
*wink* I swear, I was cracking up over every dialogue they had .,
As a matter of fact, I loved all the Weasleys .,
U+201CNow, you two U+2013 this year, you behave yourselves .,
If I get one more owl telling me you've U+2013 you've blown up a toilet or U+2013""Blown up a toilet?,
We've never blown up a toilet.""Great idea though, thanks, Mum.U+201D The World Building I finally see why everyone admires J.K. Rowling .,
Hogwarts and the wizard world she creates is whimsically ingenious .,
Honestly, why can't Quidditch be a real sport?,
It's fantastic!,
I want to ride a broom stick and hit flying balls into peoples' faces!,
All flavor jelly beans?,
How awesome is that?,
Apparently, you can buy them from Amazon..including earwax flavor (Eww, wasn't licorice bad enough?) .,
I'm not kidding, look it up!,
Rowling did a marvelous job of luring me into Potter's world .,
The only aspect of the universe that puzzles me, is where exactly is Hogwarts?,
Is it in a different universe from our reality?,
If so, how are Harry and Ron (I started a wee bit on Chamber of Secrets..as soon as I finished this one) able to fly a car there?!,
What I Loved U+269C The protagonist and side characters .,
Lovely, lovely, lovely characters .,
Rowling did a spectacular job of creating such a hilarious and realistic cast.U+269C The plot was highly entertaining .,
Though a little short, Harry and his friends' adventure was incredibly entertaining and I am especially curious about what other secrets Hogwarts holds..U+269C Rowling's writing was pleasant and engaging .,
A little simple, yes, but short and sweet .,
What else should I expect from a Middle Grade novel?U+269C The plot twist in the end .,
I'm not going to lie, I felt quite childish that I didn't see it coming .,
It was so obvious, yet I was too busy laughing over Harry swallowing Quidditch balls to notice what was right in front of me.U+269C The villains .,
*claps* Well done, Rowling .,
Well done .,
What I Didn't Love U+269C The pacing .,
A short novel?,
Understandable .,
An abrupt ending?,
Inexcusable .,
Final Thoughts I hope all you Muggles are happy now!,
I finally did it!Harry Potter was so wonderful!,
I really should've read it all those years ago .,
The characters were exceptional, story incredible, writing amiable..honestly, what else can I say, other than it truly was a magical book .,
I'll absolutely be finishing this series .,
:)WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .,
THIS IS EPIC .,
FUCKING EPIC .,
_____________________________________________________________Guys my little sister just came put to me with this book in her hand and asked if I wanted to BR with her .,
She looked so happy when I said yes .,
It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,
I'd heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon, but still I didn't feel compelled to read the books .,
I've been reader all my life but I don't know, I was kinda undecided about it .,
Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watchingIt was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,

Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watching the films, so what may I am losing about the story (oh boy!,
how wrong I was!) .,
I had some good surprises because I wasn't reading the books like in the third movie .,
When I watched the fourth film, Goblet of Fire, I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book BUT it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books .,
Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish, he had an edition on English of the first book, this one, and since by then I already was reading on English, he lent me the book .,
Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books .,
I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that it's not mine, still I don't want to have books, etc. .,
that are not mine under my care .,
Still, my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish .,
Since I wasn't SO convinced to read the books, I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book .,
I started to reading it. .,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Right in the first pages, when Hagrid mentioned WHO lent him out the flying motorcycle!!!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Keep on mind that I already watched 4 films by then, so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle, mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Then, I knew that J.K. Rowling was a wicked genius!!!,
And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book, since certain character that appears in the first book, then I said "Oh, boy, what a boring chapter, why did J.K. bothered to create such unimportant character?" and I was starting to read the fifth book and. .,
"Mmh. .,
where I heard about this character before..where?..mmmh..OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
NO!!!,
IT CAN'T BE!!!" .,
By then, I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW!,
Yes, it was the same character!!!,
Right in the first book!!!,
So, re-confirmed like for the umpteenth time. .,
J.K. Rowling is a wicked genius!!!,
I enjoyed a lot reading the first book .,
J.K. Rowling has a very interesting style of writing .,
Also, the first book is very good combining the magical world with the normal things that people has to do when kids are beginning school .,
Going to buy the school supplies .,
Having to deal different kind of teachers .,
Some good, some strict, some both .,
The forming of friendships with schoolmates .,
Indeed a wonderful and magical book .,
Highly recommended.I absolutely adore this new edition of Harry Potter and I hope that they will make illustrated versions of all of the books (although they might get quite big..) Getting to experience this story once again, after not having read the book for a long time and this time with beautiful illustrations to complement the story was a truly magnificent experience .,
J.K. Rowling is the queen!!Harry Potter is and will always be one of my all time favorite series First book down for readalong!,
Doesn't matter how many times I read these books, they're always just as amazing as the first time around!,
So amazing!,

As for me, the movie didn't blow me away, at first .,
It did get me curious enough to pick up the first book .,
I remember falling love with everything about it, finishing the book quicker than I had finished one before and immediately hungry for the next one.At the time, I didn't know popular the series was. .,
I just knew I loved it and had to read them as quickly as possible .,
By the time I discovered these beautiful books, the first four were already out and OoTP was released not long after. .,
needless to say, I caught on quickly as to how big the fandom was .,
I loved the it all though, it felt like a big family :) I loved to hear people swap theories while waiting in line, and soak the whole atmosphere as we all eagerly waited for the bookstore to open (ours never had midnight release parties but they did open extra early).This is part of my book family :) ---I never thought it was possible to make Harry Potter BETTER, but Jim Kay has definitely managed it![First read: December 2001 .,

and The Philosopher's Stone is a relatively quick read with either very good, wonderful writing or some of the worst writing imaginable .,
Thankfully, most of the time it was simple children's story writing, which made me feel at home with the book right away.I'll say that the world was rather more lacklustre than I ever really remembered it being .,
It's quite a small world, really, in this first book and there's not an awful lot of world-building, but such a short book I think that's fair enough .,
The plot felt a little badly-stitched together in some places, as if they'd be written separately and then threaded together later .,
There were a few eye-roll moments, and some really ridiculous moments, but there were also some lovely moments, great characters I'd forgotten about and overall a nice flow to how it all panned out.The thing I'm most looking forward to is the development of Hermione .,
I don't really like Harry all that much, and Ron is just one of those "oh, you're here" characters to me, and my favourite Luna won't be turning up for another four books or so, although I didn't remember that Hermione had been purposefully described as Bossy and I'm so excited to see how she changes in the books .,
Honestly, she was always my favourite.I'm glad I'm re-reading the series .,
I'm so glad I'm not going to become obsessed: I'm so glad I'm not going to remove it from my heart altogether, too .,
It's taken a while, and I needn't have been scared to do this, but that's what happens with Harry Potter, I suppose.First of all, this book ought to be the Philosopher's stone, dang it .,
We Americans are NOT STUPID.Second of all,this is the book that started it all .,

It's sprawling in your bed on a weekend just enjoying a good book that doesn't nag you, but it entertains you .,
It's a great book and you can see why JK Rowling went from being a struggling single mother to a kajillionaire because she is just that good.Not perfect, no writer is, but great enough.It's still very good .,
But dang it, I hate that Hagrid got everyone in trouble!,
Just finished my third reading of this book, which is saying something for someone who doesn't typically re-read anything .,

I AM SO GLAD I FINALLY STARTED READING THEM .,
I LOVE THESE BOOKS SO MUCH .,
I also can't believe I deprived myself of the amazingness that is Harry Potter for so many years .,
This is where it all began, where we were introduced to Harry Potter, Rowling's magical world, a series of exciting adventures and the excellent characters and environments she has given to English literature .,
It set the standard for contemporary fantasy .,
Rowling make full use of classic literary and mythological references, freeing herself from the confines of the merely topical, while giving it all a daring sense of newness .,
This series will live forever.The number of times I've read this book has gotten out of hand and yet, I can never get tired of reading Harry Potter.Although I believe I should mark this as my first time reading the books in English; all the previous times has been the translated version .,
It's like a whole other world!,
Almost as if I'm reading the book for the first time!Non c'U+00E8 bisogno di dire niente, se non: magico.Wow..nggak kerasa sudah 15 tahun sejak saya kenalan sama Harry Potter dan terpesona pada dunia buatan Madame Rowling ini .,
Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review, tapi sebelum itu, rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir ini.Saya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah, sekitar akhir 1997 .,
Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilih-milih buku bekas ketika shopkeeper-nya menawari saya buku ini .,

Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review, tapi sebelum itu, rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir ini.Saya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah, sekitar akhir 1997 .,
Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilih-milih buku bekas ketika shopkeeper-nya menawari saya buku ini .,
Dia berpromosi kalo ini buku bagus banget dan sayang banget kalo ampe gak saya beli .,
Dia juga bilang kalo Harry Potter ini lagi happening banget di Inggris sana.Waktu itu saya kenal internet cuma sebatas email dan chatting doang, gak pernah browsing .,
Saya pun bukan tipe yang langganan majalah ato koran, jadi saya benar-benar gak tahu kalo ada buku berjudul Harry Potter yang lagi booming .,
Saya malah curiga kalo buku ini adalah buku jelek yang gak laku .,
Ya logikanya aja, kalo emang tuh buku buagus banget kok udah ada yang jual second-nya di Bras Basah?,
Dan kalo emang laris buanget, kenapa juga si shopkeeper maksa-maksa saya buat beli?,
Tebakan saya sih ini buku gak laku dan si shopkeeper mo nepu saya (Oh..how stupid I was).Akhirnya buku Harry Potter 1 itu saya beli juga karena sang shopkeeper menjamin saya boleh tukar dengan buku lain kalo nggak puas .,
Dan begitulah awalnya saya kenal sama Harry Potter.Rasanya saya gak perlu menulis sinopsis buku ini ato bahkan memberi tahu buku ini termasuk dalam genre apa .,
I mean, seriously?,
Sudah 15 tahun lebih sejak demam Harry Potter melanda dunia, it's been all over the news .,
Kalo bahkan ampe detik ini Anda nggak tahu garis besar cerita Harry Potter, berarti Anda emang gak berminat sama buku ini .,
Then why bothers now?,
;)Jadi lebih baik saya membahas apa yang saya rasakan sewaktu membaca kembali buku ini setelah 15 tahun berlalu.Yang pertama saya rasa sih "aura"nya yang beda .,
Sewaktu pertama baca Harry Potter dulu, teman-teman saya gak ada yang ngeh sama buku ini (yah sebenernya ampe sekarang temen saya yang baca buku ini juga sedikit sih :| ) .,
Jadi saya heboh sendiri, bahas buku ini sendirian (dan dapat tatapan loe-ngomong-apa-sih dari teman-teman) bahkan fangirling pun sendirian #kasian .,
Sekarang ini, berkat GR dan BBI, saya jadi kenal banyak orang yang juga ngefans sama Harry Potter bahkan ampe baca bareng .,
Jelas vibe-nya beda banget .,
Dan itu menyenangkan .,
Horeeeee..saya masuk golongan mainstream #hehe.Yang kedua, saya mengubah pandangan saya tentang Harry di buku pertama .,
Awal baca dulu, saya beranggapan Harry ini kepo banget .,
"Kenapa sih pusing banget sama kemungkinan Sorcerer Stone dicuri sama Voldemort?,
Kenapa gak kirim Hedwig aja ke Dumbledore sih buat warning?"-- itu adalah pertanyaan saya dulu.Sekarang saya ngerti kenapa.Seperti yang dibilang Harry, Dumbledore tahu bahwa Harry butuh untuk mencoba melawan karena pertarungan dengan Voldemort itu personal untuk Harry .,
Gimana pun, Voldemort lah yang membunuh orangtua Harry .,
Dan Harry sadar kalo Voldemort bisa kembali menyerang dia.Tapi terutama, karena Harry sadar bahwa kembalinya Voldemort dapat membuat dia kehilangan dunia sihir.He was nothing in the muggle world .,
Gak punya siapa pun dan apa pun .,
Lalu dia menemukan semuanya di dunia sihir : sahabat, kebahagiaan dan terutama : penerimaan .,
Penerimaan yang tak pernah dia dapatkan sebelumnya .,
Gak heran kalo Harry berkeras mempertahankannya .,
I'd do the same if I were him .,
I'd fight the nastiest wizard if I have to in order not to let something most precious being taken from me .,
So I could understand Harry's determination to fight Voldemort even when he's still a kid.Ketiga, ternyata saya sudah suka Ron dari buku ke 1 X).Jangan salah, dari trio itu Ron memang favorit saya kok .,
Saya suka Ron karena kalimatnya yang witty dan rada sarkastis, belum lagi sindirannya yang tajam .,
Tapi kualitas itu baru keliatan di buku kedua (ato malah ketiga?) .,
Yang pasti bukan di buku pertama.Dulu saya gak ngerti apa yang bikin saya bersimpati sama Ron sejak awal .,
Sekarang saya tahu .,
Karena Ron orang pertama yang "menerima" Harry .,
Dia gak meremehkan Harry seperti yang dilakukan Malfoy, tapi dia juga gak memujanya secara berlebihan .,
Dia menganggap Harry sama normalnya dengan dia, and that's enough.Keempat, saya makin kagum dengan persahabatan Ron dan Hermione .,
They're true bestfriends.Tanpa ragu Ron dan Hermione menemani Harry untuk melawan Voldemort walopun mereka tahu resikonya .,
I mean, saya ngerti kesetiaan Ron dan Hermione pada Harry di buku ke-7 .,
They've come a long way .,
Tapi di buku 1?,
Saat mereka baru kenal 1 tahun kurang serta belum ngeh seberapa parah kondisinya kalo Voldemort kembali berkuasa?,
That's great.Kelima, perubahan karakter Neville kerasa banget ya .,
Neville yang penakut dan gak berani membela dirinya sungguh berbeda dengan Neville di buku ke-7 .,
I forgot how awkward, clumsy and shy Neville was .,
But let's talk about him on the later book.Keenam, wow..penerjemah Harry Potter ini keren sekali ya.Saya sudah pernah sih baca versi Inggris dan terjemahan buku ini (untuk reread yang ini, saya baca versi Inggrisnya lagi), dan dari dulu memang saya tahu penerjemahnya emang canggih .,
Tapi baru sekarang saya benar-benar ngeh.Mirror of Erised diterjemahkan Cermin Tarsah .,
Erised yang merupakan anagram dari desire, diterjemahkan jadi tarsah yang anagram dari hasrat .,
Wow!,
Dan setelah saya googling, saya dapat info kalo sebenarnya ide Tarsah ini baru kepikir belakangan, menjelang bukunya turun cetak .,
Karena sang penerjemah berkeras mesti ada padanan yang tepat untuk "erised" .,
Dan iya, beliau emang bener karena erised dan tarsah adalah padanan yang cocok.Ketujuh, hmm..saya tetap gak ngerti kenapa Professor Quirrell gak bisa menyentuh Harry hanya di bagian akhir buku ini?,
Waktu awal cerita, Harry bertemu Prof. Quirrell di Diagon Alley dan saat itu mereka sudah berjabat tangan .,
Kok saat itu tangan si Quirrell gak melepuh ya?,
Padahal sudah jelas kalo Voldemort telah "nebeng" di tubuh Quirrell saat itu.Kedelapan, saya makin kagum deh sama JK Rowling.Oke..saya tahu kalo JKR emang banyak menggunakan bantuan mitos, legenda ato apalah itu dalam ceritanya .,
So it's not really original .,
Tapi toh emang gak ada formula yang benar-benar baru .,
Yang penting sih gimana Rowling bisa meramu bahan yang ada .,
And she's really good at it.Tapi yang sebenarnya keren dari Rowling adalah : dia benar-benar paham karakter pembacanya.I guess in some points of our life, even if it's just for one time, we ever felt like Harry, who's a misfit and wishing to go to some place new where we could start everything from the scratch or becoming a different people .,
But not everyone could do that .,
Apparently Harry is one of those lucky people.Reading Harry's journey gave me happiness .,
Happiness that comes from knowing that at least there's one person in this world who could fulfill his dreams .,
It also gave me some hopes that in the end everything will be fine for me too .,
If this boy whose life was much more miserable than me finally found what he always wanted, how could I not?,
:)Dan Rowling juga dengan cerdasnya memilih setting di Inggris, suatu tempat yang masih bisa terjangkau dan karenanya masih terasa "dekat" .,
Bukannya tempat jauh antah berantah seperti di Middle Earth sana, atau dunia magic namun tak terjangkau seperti Abarat .,
Terlibatnya kaum manusia non sihir (aka muggle) juga tempat-tempat di Inggris seperti stasiun King's Cross membuat cerita ini makin terasa dekat di hati, membuat kita (oke..sebenernya sih saya) berani berharap bahwa suatu saat nanti saya juga bisa dapat.ehem..surat saya sendiri .,
Seorang teman saya bahkan sampe mencoba menekan pilar di tempat yang semestinya jadi peron 9 3/4 waktu dia lagi ada di King's Cross dan waktu salah seorang petugas di sana melihat kelakuan teman saya, si petugas bilang : "You're not the first person who tried looking for that platform." Bhahak..ternyata banyak yang bermimpi ke Hogwarts eh?,
;)Dan alasan kenapa saya kasih 5 bintang walopun saya mengakui kalo cerita di buku ini masih kalah spekta dibanding buku-buku berikutnya?Karena ini adalah buku pertama .,
The one that started it all .,
Buku ini juga yang bikin saya kenal dan jadi langganan (sampe sekarang) sama sebuah toko di Bras Basah itu .,
It's always nice to find a new friend because of one certain book.Lastly, just wanna say this : for you all who feel like you don't fit in, who wished for a magical school, or secret garden or magical cupboard that could open secret passage to magical land and still secretly keeping those wish alive : keep on wishing .,
Keep on hoping .,
Who knows, maybe your "letter" is on its way now :)I've honestly read this book so many times I find it kind of boring .,

So I have read this particular book no less than 100 times - no hyperbole in that statement I swear.*This is my review of the illustrated version which I found to be an absolute gem and a must own for all Harry Potter fanatics, such as myself .,
Before I share some photos of my favorite illustrations here are some thoughts about the overall book: This may be one of those things that is more of a collectors item versus an essential book for reading .,
It was fun and offered me a whole different experience to reading the book in general, but I'm not so sure I would be so quick to pick it up again for pure reading purposes .,
It is very large and heavy .,
It is awkward to hold and can be difficult to read if you do your reading in bed (guilty) .,
Like I mentioned, it enhances the reading experience but not completely essential to enjoying the book .,
Now, I don't have kids and the last picture book I read was Berenstein Bears .,
I did personally find the images to be on the darker side and more wacky and whimsical instead of soft and child-like (whatever that means) .,
I feel like these illustrations may appeal to more adults than kids but I don't read to kids before bed or even know what kids like .,
I don't even have the faintest idea who Jim Kay illustrates for so take that tidbit with a grain of salt .,
Here are some of my favorite illustrations so enjoy!,
The house in the middle of the ocean .,
Harry and Hagrid .,
Diagon Alley .,
Hogwarts Express - full version of the cover .,
Some insanely cool ghosts .,

I'm going to try and speak of just this book in this review - so (beyond these few statements) I won't touch on how incredibly built the series is .,
Each book is builds on the ones before it, widening and strengthening the world .,
There are foreshadowings and moments peppered throughout the series that sometimes don't come into play for many books to come .,
As Harry grows and becomes more mature, so too do these books .,
It's something that's almost impossible to realize here, in the first one, and that I still appreciate each and every time I pick up this series.When I first picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had no idea the impact it would have on my life .,
It was just a story, about a boy that finds out he's a wizard and has to fight the forces of evil .,
That's what I thought when I started it that first time .,
Very quickly I was drawn into the world of magic that J.K. Rowling penned, surrounded by witches and wizards, magic, and muggles .,
When I try to examine my feelings for this (and all future books), I run into the problem of not being able to quantify what makes it so special .,
The story is a classic; boy finds out he's special, learns about world, fights evil, wins .,
The world is intricate and fun, with a lot of cleverness - plays on words, simple ciphers, and logic puzzles made me smile - while still being straightforward .,
The characters, though varied and three-dimensional, are fairly standard.And yet, this all combines into this wonderful, fantastical world that pulls me in and makes me wonder what's hiding behind that brick wall over there, or what I might be missing out of the corner of my eye.I remember, distinctly, the feeling of sorrow that I had upon finishing this first book and realizing I was already too old to get a letter to Hogwarts .,
The world is so enchanting that I can't help but want to be a part of it .,
It's all about the feeling that it evokes in me .,
It makes me feel like there's magic in the world, and it's not necessarily the turn-a-mouse-into-a-snuff-box type of magic, or the type where the chess pieces actually fight each other (though, how awesome would that be?) .,
It's the type where friendship is stronger than anything that gets thrown at it .,
Where people, kids, can fight against injustice and wrong - and win .,
It lets you know that life isn't always fair, and that you might have to battle against things that are scary and horrible, but the happiness at the end is always worth it.And I suppose that's what keeps me coming back, time and time again, to re-read, revisit, and relive this story .,
It makes me feel a part of something amazing.And that is definitely magical.Review also available at The Book EatersHarry Potter holds a forever-place in my heart .,
His story is one of my favorites ever .,
This re-read just reinforced that thought .,
Pathetic .,
Really pathetic.Harry Potter is more of a Mary-Sue than Eragon .,
More than Nancy Drew .,
More than the worst of fanfiction I've seen.He's rich, popular and famous for absolutely nothing of his own doing .,
He destroys the power of the big bad guy before he's a year old .,
He has the whole angsty past down pat .,
He instantly becomes the best at flying without ever having done it before, wasting all the older and more experienced flyers .,
And get this - he fries bad guys when they touch his skinPathetic .,

And get this - he fries bad guys when they touch his skin because the power of his mother's love is so amazing that it protects him.I mean, gosh, the only Sueish habit we aren't subjected to is multipage rants on his appearance each morning .,
Or the devoted unicorn of unusual powers, of course, but I'm expecting him to show up in the very next book .,
After all, she has to keep some plot devices for the next one, doesn't she?,
Can't put all her brilliant twists out at once..*heavy sarcasm*Don't even get me started on the plot .,
Epic failure .,
'Nuff said.Harry wasn't any excuse for a hero .,
He did nothing, he just sat around and things happened to him .,
End of story .,
His fame was inherited, his fortune was inherited, he lived with his relations and allowed them to bully him, and couldn't even manage to read his own mail .,
His wonderful skills were not worked at and studied for years but picked up instantly, and he bet the bad guys by electrocuting them with his infamous zapper skin.I could go on for hours .,
The thing that really gets to me is that this is the great literature of our age?,
What hope is there for any decent writers if all kids want to read is this utter garbage?,
What hope is there for the world if kids are growing up thinking this is good literature?This is a dangerous book .,
It made me consider both suicide and mass homicide, and it is definitely not suitable for children.Before I say anything, I want to show you the anime I watched in the cinema when I was a five years old kid:After that my parents bought me My Neighbor Totoro storybook and many other storybooks also by Studio Ghibli .,
I read each of these books until they fell apart.I hope that might help you to understand why I have never been impressed by the Harry Potter series.Edited@01/10/2016:Although I usually don't have many good things to say about Harry Potter series, but this animinized (or manga) verBefore I say anything, I want to show you the anime I watched in the cinema when I was a five years old kid:After that my parents bought me My Neighbor Totoro storybook and many other storybooks also by Studio Ghibli .,

I was in high school at the time .,
I remember desperately trying to find out the meaning of the word "tantrum" .,
Hahaha!,
The good old days .,
I need to find the time to reread this series, and its last book .,
I've never had the strength to finish reading the last one .,
It launched the year I had my son .,
It felt too much reading it .,
I didn't want it to end .,
That was nine years ago .,
I think it's high time I read it.5* I can now say, I finally see what all the fuss is about in these delightfully woven, darling little characters .,
Sheesh .,
I even teared up at Hagrid's present to him .,
I have discovered that I am beyond a sap.I just had to add this in because it also made me cry..my goodness..I am a mess with tears over all humanity this year..http://www.bbc.co.ukewsbeat/article..ReseU+00F1a:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKbYJ..No hay palabras I loved that I remembered this so well .,
It's still just as amazing and everyone has got to read them at some point .,
What can I say. .,
I don't trust people who don't love Harry Potter, because I adore this book and all that magical world .,

As originally written the series (considering the time between publication of each volume) actually grew with the first generation of kids who read them .,
They do get gradually darker as they go on, but (originally) the children who'd started were growing to .,
So, they actually matured with the story .,
(My only caveat is that parents should be sure their children are mature enough now to move to each volume .,
Now a ten year old could conceivably buy the set and read them one after the other, so, parents need to be proactive and be sure their "youths" are ready, mature enough for each book.)I'm amazed at how much I still "feel" I know these characters and care about them even though they are fictional in a fantasy world .,
It's an accomplishment that's seen in the best of novels .,
Congratulations Ms.Rowling .,
While they have their flaws these are wonderful books .,
I had started to give them 4 stars, I give very few 5 star ratings .,
BUT upon consideration, I realized I'd read them several times and still enjoyed them greatly .,
These are wonderfully written novels .,
I rate it 5 stars.This novel opens the story of Harry Potter, the boy who lived .,
We get to meet Harry, his aunt, uncle and cousin .,
We are introduced to the "wizarding world" and we go to Hogworts .,
And of course, we meet Ron and Hermione .,
I'd say if you're not charmed by this book and don't find yourself caring about Harry and his friends..maybe you should check for Grinch blood- Enjoy.Harry Potter changed my life .,
I don't say this lightly.I was very young when I started reading these, I was 9 .,
The librarian at the ary I was attending pulled me aside and gave me this book to take home to read, her own personal copy, because at the time Harry Potter hadn't been read and approved for the library yet .,
She may have broke some rules at the time, but I'll bet she doesn't know that breaking that rule made me who I am today.This story is magical .,
Literally .,
I re-read this serieHarry Potter changed my life .,

I re-read this series every year .,
Every September .,
Sometimes twice a year if I feel the need .,
No matter how old I get, when I pick up these books I feel like a kid again .,
You don't have to be a kid to love Harry Potter, you don't have to like fantasy to like Harry Potter, you don't even have to be a big reader to love Harry Potter .,
All you have to do is open your mind (and your heart :').) Please pick up one of these books if you haven't yet .,
I don't care if you're 6 or 60, they will enlighten you to a whole new world .,
They will make you feel happiness, sadness, anger, all of the feelings, all of the time .,
I LOVE YOU J.K. ROWLING .,
I mean that .,
haha .,
I simply adored this book I'm not used to read books after I watched the movies, but it'll be that way with my Harry Potter books, because I'm a huge fan of the movies and I've already saw them all .,
The good thing is that I don't really remember anything at all, haha (just the "big" parts .,

To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats .,
For this review, I will be writing as someone incapable of suspending his disbelief.This book was terrible!,
I mean, this author is obviously on drugs or insane or something like that, and why she has been allowed to publish such patent nonsense is beyond me .,
What is even more horrifying is that so many people, adults and children, are supporting this madwoman .,
I mean, even some of my friends and family, people I respect have come under her spell!Her spell .,
Ha!,
As though such things as spells and magic really exist .,
I know she and her hoard of followers believe so, but we, the right-thinking, rational people of the world know better, don't we?The beginning was okay, and I had high hopes for it .,
I thought it might be an interesting story about this family, the Dursleys, who seem to be people after my own heart .,
Sensible, no-nonsense folk, these, who know what's real and what isn't .,
But within ten pages, I knew something wasn't right .,
Think about this - some crazy old man in robes shows up with a tiny device that can put out streetlights from a distance?,
A cat changes into a woman?,
Outrageous!,
And then the flying motorcycle, and nonsensical ravings about magicians and dark lords and curses, and that's where it all started to go downhill.I forced myself to slog through this mess of nonsense, though by the time I got to chapter five, I had pretty much given up .,
Nothing this book describes could possibly take place in the real world, and it is almost criminal that she should get this kind of fame and attention .,
She is a font of nonsense and mayhem, poisoning the minds of everyone her work touches .,
If you haven't read these books, I recommend that you stay away from them .,
If you have, then I beg you to come to your senses and embrace the real world .,
Give up this madness and join us over here in the world where truth is truth and Harry Potter is meaningless vapor.U+062A U+0623 U+062E U+0631 U+062A U+0639 U+0627 U+0645 U+0627 U+0639 U+0646 U+0645 U+0639 U+0631 U+0641 U+0629 U+0627 U+064A U+0634 U+064A U+0621 U+0639 U+0646 U+0647 U+0627 U+0631 U+064A U+0628 U+0648 U+062A U+0631 U+0644 U+0627 U+0643 U+062A U+0628 U+0647 U+0648 U+0644 U+0627 U+0627 U+0641 U+0644 U+0627 U+0645 U+0647 U+0648 U+0644 U+0627 U+0627 U+064A U+0634 U+064A U+0621U+0648 U+0627 U+0644 U+0622 U+0646 U+0627 U+0646 U+0647 U+0649 U+0623 U+0648 U+0644 U+062A U+062C U+0631 U+0628 U+0629 U+0644 U+064A U+0645 U+0639 U+0647 U+0648 U+0623 U+0646 U+0627 U+0645 U+0633 U+062A U+0645 U+062A U+0639 U+0644 U+0623 U+0642 U+0635 U+0649 U+062D U+062F U+0648 U+0643 U+0623 U+0646 U+0646 U+064A U+0623 U+0639 U+0648 U+062F U+0645 U+0631 U+0627 U+0647 U+0642 U+0627 U+0645 U+0646 U+062C U+062F U+064A U+062FU+062A U+0623 U+062E U+0631 U+062A U+0661 U+0669 U+0639 U+0627 U+0645 U+0627 U+0639 U+0646 U+0645 U+0639 U+0631 U+0641 U+0629 U+0627 U+064A U+0634 U+064A U+0621 U+0639 U+0646 U+0647 U+0627 U+0631 U+064A U+0628 U+0648 U+062A U+0631 U+0644 U+0627 U+0643 U+062A U+0628 U+0647 U+0648 U+0644 U+0627 U+0627 U+0641 U+0644 U+0627 U+0645 U+0647 U+0648 U+0644 U+0627 U+0627 U+064A U+0634 U+064A U+0621U+0648 U+0627 U+0644 U+0622 U+0646 U+0627 U+0646 U+0647 U+0649 U+0623 U+0648 U+0644 U+062A U+062C U+0631 U+0628 U+0629 U+0644 U+064A U+0645 U+0639 U+0647 U+0648 U+0623 U+0646 U+0627 U+0645 U+0633 U+062A U+0645 U+062A U+0639 U+0644 U+0623 U+0642 U+0635 U+0649 U+062D U+062F U+0648 U+0643 U+0623 U+0646 U+0646 U+064A U+0623 U+0639 U+0648 U+062F U+0645 U+0631 U+0627 U+0647 U+0642 U+0627 U+0645 U+0646 U+062C U+062F U+064A U+062FU+201CHogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,Teach us something please,Whether we be old and bald,Or young with scabby knees,Our heads could do with fillingWith some interesting stuff,For now they're bare and full of air,Dead flies and bits of fluff,So teach us something worth knowing,Bring us back what we've forgot,Just do your best, we'll do the rest,And learn until our brains all rot..U+201DNo review can do justice to the magic that is Harry Potter .,

Yesterday my friend prodded me to read this book and from many other times, she asked me I said no. After that, she promised she would leave me alone only if I read the first chapter .,

I finally get Harry Potter!,
I know it's not exactly rocket science, but I didn't fully understand the obsessive fascination with this series until I read the first book to my kids .,
They were absolutely RIVETED the entire time .,
Every magical enchantment was rewarded with an "ooohhh" and "ahhh," every one of Ron's jokes met with hysterical laughter, and I could actually watch my son and daughter grow stronger with each impossible obstacle or horrific monster Harry overcame .,
In one early scene, Leah literally started crying when Harry thought he would be thrown out of school and sent back to the Dursley's .,
Now THAT is a sure sign of someone who is LIVING a book, not reading it.So that's why my kids loved it .,
Here's why *I* loved it: Harry is strong .,
He stands up for what is right regardless of who stands against him (friend, enemy, authority figure, incorporeal undead wizard of darkness, etc.), which makes him a powerful hero for my 4- and 6-year-old .,
He's brave, self-sacrificing, and honorable .,
I think Harry proves his own character, and addresses the book's central theme itself, in a scene he shares with Malfoy near the beginning of his time at Hogwarts .,
In this particular scene, Malfoy gives a snotty little spiel on how he can introduce Harry to the best wizarding families and help him stay away from the "wrong sort." Harry then refuses to shake Malfoy's hand and responds, "I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks." And isn't that the essence of growing up?,
Moving away from simply doing what others tell us to do and learning to discern right and wrong for ourselves?,
Then, as soon as we know what's right, we can work on growing strong enough to stand up for it regardless of who stands against us .,
Harry is brilliant!,
Almost as brilliant as his author, who's created a story that is both wonderful and wonderfully told .,
Bravo!MEG'S FAVORITE QUOTES (and, of course, Dumbledore says most of them):Scars can come in handy.Harry wished he had about eight more eyes .,
The very dust and silence seemed to tingle with some secret magic.From that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend .,
There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.One can never have enough socks.Death is but the next great adventure.Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.The truth. .,
is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever .,
It is in your very skin.There are all kinds of courage .,
It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said?,
I can only tell you my experience in reading it for the very first time in the form of the illustrated version .,
I had such a great time reading this book .,
I had only watched a handful of the films prior to picking it up and had forgotten many of the scenes, so this story had some surprises for me .,
But just as wonderful in the surprise department were the amazing illustrations which never intruded upon the story and only enhanced it .,

But just as wonderful in the surprise department were the amazing illustrations which never intruded upon the story and only enhanced it .,
Other than viewing some of them online, I purposefully didn't peek ahead in the book, but waited until the illustrations were revealed as the story unfolded, never knowing what I'd find as I turned each page .,
Would there be this scene or that one next?,
And from which perspective would I get to view something--from above, from below, or from straight on?,
Which character would I get to see next?,
How much color or detail would there be?,
How much emotion would be conveyed?,
Not every page had an official illustration on it, but every page had a little something extra included that made it a treat to look at, whether the page looked marbled or had mysterious looking splotches on it .,
But even when there were full color illustrations on a page, I was able to use my imagination just as well as if there hadn't been any at all .,
Mr. Kay really did this book credit .,
I'm very happy for him since he was so worried that he wouldn't .,
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what..But getting back to the story, which I haven't even talked about yet, what I liked best about it were the growing bonds between the characters, the slippery lines between good and evil, the many forms in which bravery appeared, the hope and optimism stirring in the hearts and minds of the characters, even when all seemed lost, and finally, the magic woven within this book which had nothing to do with the spells cast .,
I don't know why I waited so long to begin this series, but in a way I'm glad I did, just so I could kick off reading it with this very special edition .,
I wish I could wait to read all the books in this form, but no way!,
I'm sure I'll have read the entire series before the next illustrated book comes out .,
Then I guess I'll just have to read them again in the illustrated form .,
I will have no problem at all doing that .,

Cidden, bir kitabU+0131n uyarlamasU+0131 bu kadar gU+00FCzel olabilir :) Hagrid'in Harry'i sevdiU+011Fini biliyordum, ama BU KADAR sevdiU+011Fini bilmiyordum .,
:) Sondaki hediyesi falan U+00E7ok gU+00FCzeldi .,
Yasak Orman sahnesinde Neville'in olmasU+0131. .,
Sevdim yani.KitabU+0131n U+00E7eviri ya da edisyonundaki bazU+0131 U+015Feyleri sevmedim .,

Garip. .,

But as I am very Type-A, I am going to review each book individually as they all have interesting aspects to them.This is the first book in the series .,

You meet Harry .,
You learn a tiny bit about who he is and why he is with his Aunt and Uncle at the very beginning of the book .,
You learn quickly to DESPISE his Aunt and Uncle and lovely cousin Dudley .,
ICK!And then you go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .,
What an awesome place .,
I know that there has to be other people other than myself that wish that this was a real place and that we could all go there .,
Ghosts, pictures that move from one frame to another and 3-headed dogs named Fluffy!You also learn about Voldemort, who is the reason Harry has to live with the Dursley's in the first place .,
Voldemort killed Harry's parents, and tried to kill Harry, but the spell backfired!,
So Voldemort is wandering around out in the world just biding his time when he can come back and finish Harry off !!There is so much going on in this book, that I feel you have to read it more than once to get it all .,
Fantastic read!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I have reread this book so many times; I think this is my 6th reread of it [possibly more] and I never kept track .,
I will be doing so from this point forward!,
:-)Reread September 18, 2016I still love this book so very much .,
I love how you discover everything right along with Harry .,
It is always such a joy to reread this book .,
I do an annual re-reading of this series around winter time .,
December is the ideal time to start because Harry Potter has always seemed like a winter type series to me .,
I don't know why or how I started this tradition but I always attempt to follow it .,
This is the first year I'll be writing a review for my rereading because I realized I never did a proper one for the books .,
I think the reason is that I don't think I can find the words to describe just how much I love and adore this series .,

J.K. Rowling created a world that I can sink into, that I can immerse myself into at any point in my life .,
I grew up with Harry, I remember reading GoF when I was 14, knowing that I couldn't have done what Harry did even though we were the same age .,
I remember realizing I was 18, that eighteen year olds didn't attend Hogwarts anymore .,
As Harry grew, I grew .,
I grew as a person, I grew as a fan of this series .,
I went from standing in line to see GoF with my mom when I was 9 to repurchasing the entire set so that I would have copies in my first apartment .,
It's always a relief to remember that Harry, Ron, and Hermione have, and never will, change .,
They have stayed constant during my life .,
It may sound so cliche but Hogwarts, and these series, will always be there .,
They are one of my childhood homes that I can visit again and again with just a flip of the cover .,
It wasn't called this at all - but for some reason the title changed in the US and there is no original title versions of this on this site, which is also strange .,

We had just finished reading all the books of Dahl and were looking for something else to be getting on with - and there was this article in the paper saying that the Fundamentalist Christians wanted this book banned.Well, let's face it, there is no higher recommendation for a book and I remain grateful to the Christian community for pointing me in the right direction with this one.After the forth book my youngest daughter started reading them to me - there are few joys in life that are surpassed by books or daughters, mixing them together was always going to be a highlight, and how could it not be?These books got better as they went on - the last one was particularly good.There are no words I can think to write that can even come near to doing this book justice .,
This is a series that can only be savoured, like a top-dollar meal in a restaurant .,
There is only one way to appreciate it, and that is to just inhale every word of it.I had kept this on my mental shelf as a series that I would read one day, just not sure about the timeline .,
It got hurried along, but I don't regret it for even a single moment .,

I'm just in Hogwarts-heaven right now and lovin' it!;-) Having just read this for the first time, I definitely missed the boat .,
My taste in books now skews a little darker .,
At the same time, I'm glad I finally read it and though I don't think it was the best book of all time or anything, I can definitely understand the hype .,
I'm sure I'll eventually read all the books, in which case I'll understand the fandom and probably be a super fan myself.#MugglesReadAlong one book down!---This book is one of my favs in the series!The magic never withers and I'm always able to find/feel something different no matter how many times I've read it .,
A true classic!I'm a 22 year old woman and this is my first time ever reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .,
It was everything that people said it was going to be .,
The world is beyond magical .,
I feel like a got a better feel of the characters .,
Neville Longbottom is my fave!,
I can't!,
I love this series too much!,
Had a bad week so I decided to re read Harry Potter (this time in english) :D You don't like this series?,
Well, fuck off then .,
You and I are N-E-V-E-R going to get along .,
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!Es war mal wieder so toll. .,
Ich liebe es Reread November 2014Obviously this isn't my first time reading Sorcerer's Stone; I think this is the 3rd reading for me .,
And as every time before, I loved it immensely .,
I really am just reminded of how incredible J.K. Rowling is at crafting a story, a whole world, and setting up the rest of the series, while still writing a smart, entertaining children's book .,
Because in reality, this first book is very young feeling, but it's never dumbed down .,

Because in reality, this first book is very young feeling, but it's never dumbed down .,
Since most people have read this or know the plot, I thought I would instead share some fun thoughts I had or noticed upon rereading this book:-What do you think the sorting hat said to Hermione, Ron, or any of the other characters when they tried it on?-Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card mentions his defeat of Grindewald, a fact that doesn't come to be important until book 6 or 7!-The Weasley twins are hilarious as always, and they know the secret passages already (probably thanks to the Marauder's Map) that shows up in book 3.-I wonder why Hermione wasn't in Ravenclaw .,
(I'm sure there is some sort of answer for this one, I had just never thought of it before).-I want Mrs. Weasley to knit me a sweater.-The Mirror of Erised's inscription backwards says, "I show not your face but your heart's desire."-In the book, when Harry first finds the Mirror of Erised, he sees a reflection of his mom, dad, and the rest of his family .,
But in the film it only shows Lily and James .,
That would've been cool to see in the film.-Apparently, chess is the only thing that Hermione ever lost at (p.217) .,
If she is so smart, don't you think she'd be really good at the strategy of chess?-After seeing Quirrell/Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, Harry starts to have nightmares about the face dripping unicorn blood .,
I wonder if this is Voldemort already using Occlumancy on Harry?-In the film, the protections that Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to get through to find the Sorcerer's Stone leave out the troll (placed by Quirrel) and the potions challenge (Snape's) .,
Would've been fun to see Hermione tackle that one.-Voldemort's face on the back of Quirrell's head is described as pale with red, slit eyes like a snake (like movie Voldemort) .,
Why isn't that how they portrayed him in the first film?!-Also, Neville's best exam grade was in Herbology .,
Aww .,
Overall, I just thought it was remarkable to note how many things Rowling references already!,
It makes me even more excited to jump right into Chamber of Secrets next!Oh shit !!,

Y pensar que es super chico igual ajaja .,
Hermione es bastante infumable a veces, pero se nota que como amiga es excelente, amo sus ironU+00EDas y su sentido del humor, me encanta !!,
Ron es otro personaje que me gusta muchU+00EDsimo, es como un gran amigo fiel .,
Hagrid es como un padre con mentalidad de niU+00F1o ajajaj, me encanta, su personalidad, su sentido del humor, sus bromas, lo fiel que es, etc. Draco es el tU+00EDpico niU+00F1o malvado, que de vez en cuando se manda de las suyas, pero al final de todo, termina perdiendo!!,
Toma Draco, por gilipollas .,
Le di 5 estrellas porque en este libro se introduce todo lo que es el mundo mU+00E1gico de Hogwarts y de todo este mundo .,

And this is his story.J.K .,
Rowling wrote a fantastic book .,
And this is not only a childrens book .,
This is an ALL-Age book .,
She wrote about a world which is magical and beauiful at the same time .,
She wrote about creatures and spells which people use today .,
I am still impressed by this author and her creativity .,
There is no book I could compare to Harry Potter.Without Harry Potter we wouldn't have Harry Potter.Especially the movies have a special place in my heart .,
Amazing!,
I'm still waiting for my letter..I've read the same book in French at the end of 2015, but I wanted to read the whole series in English to discover JK Rowling's real writing .,
I'm not disappointed at all, I'm still in love with this book !,
I'm gonna discover the next books now, because I haven't read them before.Harry Potter will always be a wonderful series, even after all these years that have gone by.Auch auf englisch ist der erste Teil von Harry Potter einfach nur toll .,

I got to enjoy the story like it was meant to be enjoyed so I know more than a few of you Potter fans wish you were me right now and got to fall in love with this series for the first time.What can I say?,
While reading this, I felt simultaneously transported back in time and into another world.The world was filled with magic and mythical creatures and the time was when I was eleven years old and filled with imagination and wonder .,
I've read my fair share of children's books, but I've never read one that so perfectly captured the feeling of how wonderful and freeing it is to be a child .,
I loved the moments when Harry, Ron, and Hermoine got to play, eat sweets, and find mischief like normal kids just as much as I liked the moments when they were learning magic and fighting monsters .,
Even the most mundane activities were written in such a wistful and intriguing way that I was afraid to miss a single word .,
Usually if I my eyes glaze over I just keep reading until I get caught up but that was impossible to do with this book .,
I was scared that if I looked away for even a moment I might miss something .,
When the story began, I hated the Dursleys with such a passion .,
A group of more miserable and hateful people has never been found .,
After a while, I had to remind myself to chill out because things were going to get better for Harry eventually .,
And that's the only way I made it though those first chapters without throwing my book across the room .,
But something happened when Harry met Ron's mom for the first time .,
I was so relieved when she was sweet and motherly towards him that I realized why the Dursleys had to be so terrible .,
There are plenty of mean and horrible people Harry has to deal with, but those bad people make the friends Harry meets seem all the more wonderful .,
After I realized how necessary the villains were to the story, I started to enjoy them more .,
When Harry and the gang got in trouble, instead of just feeling dread and worrying about them, I also looked forward to seeing how they were going to get out of their current scrape .,
There was a chemistry between all the characters in this book that was such a pleasure .,
Harry is an innocent and heroic little boy who is lucky to have a loyal and brave friend like Ron, and Hermione is the smart, mother hen .,
She worries about them both, tells them when their ideas are stupid, and then goes along to keep them out of trouble .,
And Dumbledore is insanely funny it only took two scenes for me to fall in love with him and wish he was my crazy great-uncle .,
I honestly can't think of a thing I didn't love about this book .,
I even loved the names!,
(Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington is the best name in the history of names, and I will never refer to him as U+201CHeadless NickU+201D.) Everything was so well thought out and planned, and there were more than a few surprising moments that I never saw coming .,
I am so glad that I waited as long as I did to read this .,
I have always liked to read, but when I was a kid, I didn't love it the way I do now .,
I finally know why everyone loves this book so much .,
It's not because it is the greatest piece of literature that has ever been written, It's because this book shows how joyful and fun reading can be .,
Reading doesn't have to be intimidated and hard to be good .,
The best books--the books that stick with you and make you smile when you think about them--are the ones that challenge you, teach you something useful, and entertain the heck out of you .,
This book did all that and more .,
This is the first book I have every read that I can honestly recommend everyone read .,
I'm not even sure how to do the parental guidance on this one .,
I recommend the parent read it first and then decide if their child can handle it .,
At the very least, the parent will have some fun.This review was originally posted on Kookie Krysp Reads**5/5 Stars but I wish I could give it about 9 3/4 out of 5!,
hehe .,
It's so wonderful!,
I gotta be honest, I missed the Harry Potter train whenever I was a wee tyke .,
I had never seen the movies or read the books until last year whenever my grandmom gave me and my sister the whole movie collection and told us we had to watch them because they're, "simply amazing," as she said .,
:) So, last year, me and my sister sat down and watched all of the movies, in order .,
I was absolutely amazed at how great**5/5 Stars but I wish I could give it about 9 3/4 out of 5!,

:) So, last year, me and my sister sat down and watched all of the movies, in order .,
I was absolutely amazed at how great the storyline really is, how wonderful all of the characters are and ultimately, how MAGICAL it really is .,
This past summer, my family and I went on our annual trip to Anaheim, California .,
We always go to Disneyland, Huntington Beach, and Universal Studios .,
I was really excited to hear that Universal Studios had a new "Diagon Alley," area that was supposed to be as "magical" as the Harry Potter movies .,
Let's just say, I was in absolute wonder .,
We spent almost our entire day in Diagon Alley, we only had time to ride two other rides in the whole park before closing time because we stayed there that late .,
I was amazed by how magical it all was .,
The shops, the food, the wands, the tricks, the staff, the rides, everything was completely and utterly themed for Harry Potter and I honestly felt like I was in Diagon Alley and Hogsmead .,
It was INCREDIBLE .,
So, while we were there, I decided that I HAD TO read the books .,
I wanted more of this wizarding world, I wanted to know more about the characters and everything that surrounds this world .,
So, we came home, I got on e-bay, found a brand new set of the special edition books that have spines make the castle and I bought them!,
As soon as they came in, I couldn't wait to start reading them .,
Becuase of school (I'm triple majoring in Nursing, English and Business) and because of the time I have to work (preceptorship hours for my BSN in Nursing) I haven't had near as much time to read .,
It's been difficult but I finally got caught up enough in school and finished the books that I was reading over this summer where I could start this book .,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!,
The first book in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter books .,
I must say that I was not disappointed at all .,
In fact, I'm even more in love with the world of Harry Potter and these characters that the INCREDIBLE J.K. Rowling has created .,
It's such a lovely book that explores being different, outcasted, standing up for what's right, being afraid and brave at the same time, and never losing your curiosity .,
It's such an amazing book .,
I'm so excited that I've finally got to start reading these lovely books and I can't wait to continue on!,
:) 5/5 Stars but I wish I could give it about 9 3/4 out of 5!,
hehe .,
It's so wonderful!,
Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for writing these books and creating this world .,
I believe you're never too old to discover the magic in this world and become a part of it .,
This is just excellent!,
:) xo, Rachel I can't rate Harry Potter any more than I can rate hot chocolate or weekends or the feeling of being nuzzled by a puppy .,
But I can say that the experience of reading this book now, when I'm older than Lily and James were when they had their son, was very different from the experience of reading it for the first time when I was younger than Harry .,
Before I had ever seriously said goodbye to anyone, I thought that the first chapter was comical .,

But I can say that the experience of reading this book now, when I'm older than Lily and James were when they had their son, was very different from the experience of reading it for the first time when I was younger than Harry .,
Before I had ever seriously said goodbye to anyone, I thought that the first chapter was comical .,
Now, it's a struggle not to cry alongside Hagrid, McGonagall, and Dumbledore .,
I used to immerse myself in the wizarding world without thinking too much about it .,
Now, I'm fascinated by how JKR's writing choices make that immersion possible .,
Magical cultures, histories, and economies are hinted at in a way that resembles how we usually interact with their real-life counterparts, rather than being explained through info-dumps that forcefully remind us that we're being introduced to a fictional world.I used to look up to Harry, thinking of him as a practically grown-up hero .,
Now, I'm struck by his social astuteness and his lack of pretension - I loved seeing him figure out how to share with Ron without making Ron feel embarrassed, as well as his matter-of-fact acceptance of Quirrell's speech impediment .,
I was also surprised at how manipulative he is under certain circumstances - he would indeed have done well in Slytherin .,
Mostly, I just wish I could hug him and Hedwig and the others, and protect them from the terrible things in the not-too-distant future .,
And yet, I think their willingness to confront the future is part of what makes them so lovable .,
In some ways, I still look up to them .,
Finally, this reading experience created a bridge to the version of myself that opened the book over 15 years ago .,
In the time since then, we've been inundated with other people's (mostly filmmakers') ideas of what Harry's world looks and sounds like .,
It took a bit of conscious effort, but by displacing those images I rediscovered the world that my own imagination once created - part of it modeled after people and places in my own life at the time, part of it purely invented and then seemingly forgotten, but just waiting to be brought back to life.U+201CIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live.U+201D3.5 starsIU+2019m sure this thick book became even more legendary than the author ever dreamed it would.Rowling uses cookie cutter characters to create a fascinating world of magic, wizardry, and the great divide between good and evil which has always captivated all age groups and which always will .,

Getting that invite to Hogwarts must be such fun - IU+2019m sure many normals in this world fantasize it happening to them at that age.Harry Potter is likeable, but simple .,
His friends are the same .,
The villain promises to be a fascinating one but heU+2019s not really uncovered yet save for whispers of legends and foreshadowing .,
The book was especially enjoyable at the beginning, where Harry is unfortunate in his demented average family .,
ThereU+2019s humor that works, sometimes, pushing the story along .,
The real excitement starts when Harry steps foot onto Hogwarts ground, meeting the bizarre blend of professors, other students, potions, classes, and challenges.I know the movie was rated poorly by some in comparison to the book .,
To me itU+2019s almost word for word, including dialogue .,
Some of it, such as emotion, worked better in page form .,
I do have to prefer some of the movie though, especially when playing Quidditch, because the effects made it more interesting .,
I think Rowling drug it out too long in book form, and because of this dragging on I grew a little bored at times.Overall a cute and quirky, simple novel that opens a door to a world that skyrocketed .,
IU+2019m hoping I enjoy the later novels more, just like I did with the movies.Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone by J.K Rowling - 5/5 starsI wished that I had read this book when I was younger .,

The friendship between these three will definitely be one of my favorites easily, I can already tell .,
I loved the entire book and breezed through it .,
It left my mind amazed and bewildered .,
I have watched the films countless of times and now I SEE THE MISSING PORTIONS that are so relevant to the plot .,
The book makes everything much more clear and I loved the casting of spells and the sorting hat where Harry was sorted into Gryffindor!,
Will definitely be reading this series throughout this year and I can't wait .,

Yes, that does work to an extent .,
And then I think of my younger version, reading all the crap our school teachers used to give us .,
And then I think how much fun would have been to read Harry Potter at that age .,
Why didn't anyone tell me about the book back then?,
Why didn't my parents buy it for my birthday?,

Well, almost everything .,
So mum, if you're reading this, shame on you!,
You took away from me the privilege of growing up with Harry Potter .,
That is a crime!,
A crime I say!But seriously you guys, Harry Potter is epic!,
I canU+2019t wait to get my hands on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.Naturally this was a phenomenal because it's Harry Potter and I have always loved these books since I first read them, but this edition is the brand new illustrated edition and I have to say that Jim Kay was BY FAR a wonderful choice to illustrate these because he's represented the wonder, quirk and magic of the world and characters beautifully!,
I had so many pages within this that I adored, the colour palette is beautiful and has such a great vibe, and the style is free, flowing and fabulous.ThNaturally this was a phenomenal because it's Harry Potter and I have always loved these books since I first read them, but this edition is the brand new illustrated edition and I have to say that Jim Kay was BY FAR a wonderful choice to illustrate these because he's represented the wonder, quirk and magic of the world and characters beautifully!,
I had so many pages within this that I adored, the colour palette is beautiful and has such a great vibe, and the style is free, flowing and fabulous.The story was like coming home to friends of course, and I am so excited to keep reading the next few soon!!,
5*s of course (although Harry Potter defies all rating systems)Que saudades que tinha deste mundo!,
Depois de ler o mais recente livro de Harry Potter, deu-me uma vontade imensa de voltar a reler esta saga, que marcou a minha infU+00E2ncia e adolescU+00EAncia!,
E assim comeU+00E7ou a re-leitura.Como nunca escrevi nenhuma opiniU+00E3o dos 7 livros de Harry Potter, no blogue, vou fazU+00EA-lo agora U+00E0 medida que for relendo os livros!,
por isso, podem contar com uma opiniU+00E3o em breve ;)OpiniU+00E3o aqui: https://thegirlwhoreadssbooks.wordpre..Agora .,
Vou ver o filme heheTU+00E1 liberado chorar de saudade?HU+00E1 tanto tempo que eu nU+00E3o mergulhava nessa histU+00F3ria que foi quase como se eu tivesse lendo pela primeira vez novamente .,
Quase .,
Ver os personagens tU+00E3o novos e tU+00E3o corajosos, me impressionar com os perigos que eles jU+00E1 se colocavam. .,
O mais legal de reler o livro foi que eu estava com muitos detalhes do filme na cabeU+00E7a, entU+00E3o vU+00E1rias coisas eu nU+00E3o lembrava que havia acontecido .,
Como eu disse, foi quase como ler pela primeira vez .,
Nostalgia total .,
I read it late, but still I can see how this book became so popular .,
It has everything a child needs: adventure, mystery, magic and it's well written .,
Maybe when I'll have time I'll read the rest of the books in the series.I did it backwards .,
I began with the movies and now I finished my first book!,
I loved every word of it!,
Up to the next .,
Re-reading "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" always feels like coming home The hype of Harry Potter passed me by when I was small, so itU+2019s only now (at age nineteen) that I borrowed the famed (and very tattered) novel from the library and immersed myself in the world of Hogwarts .,
It was strictly for U+201CresearchU+201D, okay?,
I canU+2019t call myself a childrenU+2019s author and yet have skipped the most impacting and controversial childrenU+2019s novel of all time .,
So first of all, I loved it .,
IU+2019m not fan of the U+201CclassicsU+201D style, but the clean prose of Harry Potter and the PhilosopherU+2019s StonThe hype of Harry Potter passed me by when I was small, so itU+2019s only now (at age nineteen) that I borrowed the famed (and very tattered) novel from the library and immersed myself in the world of Hogwarts .,

So first of all, I loved it .,
IU+2019m not fan of the U+201CclassicsU+201D style, but the clean prose of Harry Potter and the PhilosopherU+2019s Stone, the quirky description and the subtle humour could very well convert me .,
ItU+2019s written in omnipresent narrative, again, not my U+201CthingU+201D U+2013 with POV everywhere and by anyone .,
Once Harry turned eleven, we delved more into his viewing of the world, but at the beginning, we see out of everyoneU+2019 eyes .,
Even that catU+2019s .,
The character?,
Oh, the characters!,
My personal taste requires a book to be well written and have gripping characters .,
(Everything else is open for negotiation.) I loved Hagrid!,
And Dumbledore .,
And Snape (urgh) .,
And Harry!,
Ron and the Weasley twins were instant favourites of course (the latterU+2019s antics keeping me smiling the whole way through) .,
But, IU+2019ll go right ahead and say that Hermoine is my utter favourite .,
I loved her from the beginning and every aspect of her character was so well written, not to mention hilariously brought across .,
Ron and HarryU+2019s understandable disgust of her is epic .,
The only character I said, U+201CMehU+201D, at was Voldemort .,
He had so much hype around him from chapter one that I didnU+2019t think he could possibly be that scary .,
He wasnU+2019t .,
Any villain who doesnU+2019t kill his victims straight away is going to end up defeated U+2013 probably by a preteen and his little gang of snivelly nosed adventure-seekers .,
Being over ten years old, the style of childrenU+2019s books as changed since Harry Potter first hit the shelves .,
Does that affect this novel?,
No!,
It stands in a classy light of itU+2019s own .,
It canU+2019t be accused of being U+201CclichU+00E9 U+201D, because it started everything!,
ItU+2019s well written and well plotted and I think my only complaint is Harry having to spend his summer holidays back with the Dursely family .,
As to the controversial aspect?,
Witchcraft?,
Wizardry?,
Is JK Rowling promoting children to immerse themselves in the occult?,
Should we be scared of this book and ban and burn it?,
Well, apart from my personal conviction that a book should never be burned, I canU+2019t see much difference to reading about dragons and fairies, to frolicking through HarryU+2019s adventures in Hogwarts .,
JK Rowling presents a side for evil and a side for good .,
It can be argued, how is magic ever good?,
And it can also be argued, is there such a thing as magic?,
(Or fairies, for that matter!,
And I still believe in them!) Harry Potter is a fairy tale .,
Take it or leave it at that .,
If I had a small child (which I donU+2019t, beingU+2026well, a teen and all) I would probably not let them read Harry Potter until they were ten or so .,
Then we could discuss it .,
It is an epic classic, still standing after decades, and still inspiring children to imagine, have adventures, and write .,
Or find their letter to Hogwarts .,
That option might outweigh the others .,
I highly doubted that I would ever write a review for any of the Harry Potter books .,
Instead, I created a shelf called "seven greatest books ever" and threw them all in there, hoping that would be enough to display my immense love for them .,
After seeing Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows movie, I decided that I would kick start the re-reading process before the release of Part 2, so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for probably the 15th time, and began to read .,
I realized part way thI highly doubted that I would ever write a review for any of the Harry Potter books .,

After seeing Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows movie, I decided that I would kick start the re-reading process before the release of Part 2, so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for probably the 15th time, and began to read .,
I realized part way through, that even if I didn't want to review it for its literary merit, I still had much to say about the book solely regarding how it makes me feel.At twenty three years of age, the book is still everything that it was for me when I was only twelve .,
I remember seeing it in a book order (remember those?) in the sixth grade and putting a star next to it to take home to my mom .,
My mom, not wanting to buy me a book I'd never read, denied me my request, adding that it looked pretty silly anyway (the joke was on her though, she came to love them too) .,
Anyway, the next year, my cool uncle (don't we all have one?) decided he was going to buy them for my cousin and she was going to have to let me borrow them .,
So I began the Harry Potter books, and suddenly being twelve- awkward and unpopular, wasn't quite so lonely as it had always been .,
I dreamed myself right into Harry Potter's world; not in a dangerous, psychotic way, but in a starry eyed, childlike way .,
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were better friends to me than anyone I met throughout my junior high and high school years, which in a way is a bit sad, but I have no regrets.This was the first time that I've read Sorcerer's Stone since Deathly Hallows came out, and it inevitably made for a far more emotional experience than the first time around .,
What was once just good, innocent, fun can't exactly be viewed as such when you've seen the big picture .,
I literally burst into tears at the end of the chapter in which Harry and Ron finally take Hermione as their friend .,
Oh, what the heck?,
I'll go ahead and post the paragraph, in case anyone else is wanting to ride the high of that emotional wave:But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend .,
There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them .,
Knowing what they were in store for- years of utter devotion to one another made this moment so much bigger now than it had seemed at first .,
Either way though, it's a very moving moment .,
I love this book .,
I will always love this book .,
And I full intend to disown any future children of mine who can't appreciate it with me (I haven't decided as to whether or not that's a joke yet).I was expecting my return trip to Hogwarts to be something of a dampener .,
I had finished the series and after all, how many more surprises could the first book reveal?,
The magic must have faded over time and the characters must surely have achieved the status of house-guests who had overstayed their welcome .,
Predictably enough, I was wrong .,
Returning to the first book in what I can now proudly say is my most favourite series EVER was nothing short of magical .,

Predictably enough, I was wrong .,
Returning to the first book in what I can now proudly say is my most favourite series EVER was nothing short of magical .,
It was enchanting to see how the complex and multifaceted characters of the later books started off as nervous, unsure ickle-firsties .,
It was a time for firsts: a) Ill-treated, neglected 11-year old orphan Harry Potter discovers that he is a wizard - an actual, honest-to-goodness, wand-swishing wizard.b) There is a magical school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards like him and at Hogwarts, Harry Potter is a legend and so much more than a small boy who lives in a cupboard under the stairs.b) He discovers that he had brave parents who loved him dearly and lost their lives to the most powerful dark wizard in existence in a misguided attempt to save their tiny son.c) It will be the first time that he will meet his soon-to-be best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, not knowing that it would be the start of many unforeseen and memorable adventures for the trio.For me, the charm lay in reacquainting myself with my favourite cast of characters: the great and twinkly-eyed Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, stern Prof. McGonagall with a staunchly hidden soft-center, quivering Neville Longbottom who is brave enough to stand up to his friends, nasty Draco Malfoy, lovable Hagrid, the irrepressible Fred and George and of course, delightfully detestable Severus Snape .,
I also liked the fact that J.K.Rowling carved out a story that was a blend of fantasy and realism .,
She refused to patronize her young readers .,
She spoke about death in a manner that doesn't usually finds it's way into a children's book .,
With minimal sugar-coating, she created a world that was rife with pain, loss and love.In this book, Harry Potter faces his vile enemy for the very first time with nerve and bravery .,
He gets his first opportunity to prove that he is more than just a legendary kid with a mysterious past.The book sets an adequate pace, lays the foundation for future awesomeness and needless to say..the rest is history.I'm just going to be honest here: It is impossible for me to write an unbiased review of Harry Potter.I know Harry Potter has it's flaws, I know J.K. Rowling makes mistakes .,
But Harry Potter is one of those series where you could give me a list naming all its faults, . .,
and I honestly couldn't care less.I grew up with Harry, and it will always be my favourite book series .,
No matter if I'm happy or sad, I will always pick it up again eventually .,

No matter if I'm happy or sad, I will always pick it up again eventually .,
So, now that you've been warned, let's review this book (or, rather: this edition) The StoryI don't really need to go into much detail, I think everyone knows what the first book is about: Harry's first year at Hogwarts and his first encounter with Voldemort and magic .,
I love Rowling's writing and the pace of the plot .,
There really is not a single dull page in this one .,
The EditionI wanted to re-read Philosopher's Stone for a while now, but with all the TBR books in my shelf, I never really allowed myself to .,
So I was more than happy when I got this beautiful book for christmas .,
I don't need to tell you that the illustration in this are amazing, because if you took one look at the cover you know that Jim Kay can draw .,
Now, what might be more interesting: Is it worth buying?For every Potterhead: YES DEFINITELYFor everyone that just liked Harry Potter: Mhh, if you own a copy of the normal edition, it might not be necessary to buy this one, because the text inside is exactly the same, the only bonus are the illustrations .,
Even if you don't already own a copy, I don't know if it would be wise to buy this, because this book really is huge .,
Alas, hard to transport .,
No taking this book to work or school to read during break .,
But: If you don't plan to bring it with you wherever you go, why not?,
For me, this book is definitely worth the money and if I ever were to have kids, this is the book I'm going to read them .,
This is the book that made me love reading .,
When I was younger I used to hate reading .,
I couldn't do it and I had no interest in learning it, but I could memorize .,
So in kindergarten reading groups that was exactly what I did .,
I memorized .,
I memorized the reading group books and passed through them all without ever learning how to read .,
It was my first grade teacher that figured me out and spent four weeks teaching me to read .,
I owe a lot to that woman .,
Still, I didn't really like to do it .,

It wasn't until second or third grade my mom brought this home and handed it to me and told me to give it a shot .,
Chapter one I handed it back and said I didn't like it, she handed it back and told me to try again .,
Rinse and repeat for a few chapters until something amazing happened .,
I didn't want to give the book back .,
I didn't want to put it down to go eat dinner and I certainly didn't want to put it down and go to bed .,
I stayed up until I was falling asleep on the pages and then I took it to school and started my bad habit of reading in class .,
Then I read through lunch and recess and silent reading time until I finished this book .,
I devoured all the others when I could get my hands on them but between Harry Potter books I didn't know what to do with myself .,
So my parents did a little digging around and found me another book I liked and then another and another until I became the family bookworm .,
I started borrowing books from my older sister, I started reading books to my younger brother, I read just about everything and anything I could find and I loved every minute of it .,
It's really hard to rate a book that I grew up on, but if any book deserves five stars, it's this one because it helped turn me into the person I am .,
The series itself got me through a lot of hard times and I love going back to it and re-reading it because it feels like coming home .,

We meet again .,
It seems we got off on the wrong foot the last time.It took me more than ten years to read this book for the second time .,
A full review, and a full explanation of my experience with this series, to come.Rating and some words on the actual quality of the book and series will come later as I progress through the sequels .,
Other than that, I will mostly focus on my own personal thoughts.Why have I not read Harry Potter before now, itU+2019s totally amazing!,
From the first page till the last one I was hooked .,
I always thought I wouldnU+2019t enjoy a book about a wizard boy who is 11U+2026but damn I was so wrong!,
Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are probably the best characters ever .,
They are smart, loyal, brave, funny, and so much more; you canU+2019t help but love them .,
Honestly, I canU+2019t wait till I get started with the rest of the series.U+062F U+0642 U+06CC U+0642 U+0627 U+0646 U+0645 U+06CC U+062F U+0627 U+0646 U+0645 U+0627 U+06CC U+0646 U+0686 U+0646 U+062F U+0645 U+06CC U+0646 U+0628 U+0627 U+0631 U+0647 U+0633 U+062A U+06A9 U+0647 U+0647 U+0631 U+06CC U+067E U+0627 U+062A U+0631 U+062E U+0648 U+0627 U+0646 U+06CC U+0631 U+0627 U+0627 U+0632 U+0633 U+0631 U+06AF U+0631 U+0641 U+062A U+0647 U+0627 U+0645 .,

I can't believe it has been 19 years since I've last read this novel .,
I absolutely adored it even after all these years .,
By far my favorite series ever written .,
I look forward to re-reading the other books in the series throughout the year .,
This is never gonna be less than 5 stars, no matter how many times we read it .,
The squealing & excitement for the whole last chapter was greater than ever .,
Neville getting his points is pretty much everyone's favorite.Reading is truly like getting together with old friends .,
Magical ones at that.Anyone heard of this?,
It's not bad!,
It's about a kid who goes to school..no really, it's more interesting than it sounds!,

Wow this was amazing .,
I loved it so much .,
Especially with all the magic and the adventures!!!,
I need the next book now :oI've been putting off to start this series for so long, and I have no idea why .,
It was just as amazing as I expected.Can't wait to continue with it.There's no doubt in my heart that I'll keep rereading this book 'till the day I die .,
The illustrations only adds to the magic .,

There must be something tragically wrong with me .,

I might only have just finished book one (yeah, IU+2019m just a little behind the times), but IU+2019ve realised something .,
Harry Potter is a Mary Sue, Gary Stu, Marty Stu, whatever you want to call him .,
Let me say it again.HARRY POTTER IS A SUE.No wonder it was boring and bothering me so much .,
I can hear you future readers (at present I have exactly none) demanding to know why, just why, I think he is a Sue, and how dare I?,
Those of you who havenU+2019t fainted, that is.*puts on mafia boss accent* You wanna know why?,
Let me count the ways .,
If you could just keep track on your fingersU+2013oh, it looks like youU+2019ll need your toes as wellU+2013that would be really helpful.Right .,
Here we go.1 .,
HeU+2019s hated by all the nasty (some of them ridiculously evil) people.2 .,
And liked by all the good ones.3 .,
He has a cool scar, black hair, and green eyes .,
Like, yeah .,
He looks cool .,
This is the reason I stay away from the black hair/green eyes combo in my own writing: itU+2019s really something that gets doled out by most authors to their specialest favouritest characters .,
And boy, is Harry Potter special or what?4 .,
HeU+2019s famous .,
Not only that, but everyone bows to him in the street .,
I think we just discovered BuddhaU+2019s successor.5 .,
HeU+2019s rich .,
Insanely rich .,
What are the odds?6 .,
He got into the best school for magic around .,
Without even applying.7 .,
HeU+2019s a Gryffindor, the most fantabulous house in the school.8 .,
HeU+2019s fantastic at broomsticking even though heU+2019s never had any practice whatsoever.9 .,
Immediately, instead of getting punished for breaking the rules, he gets put on the Quidditch team even though itU+2019s unheard of for someone so young to be there .,
And this is after the teacher sees one single display of catching a Remembrall .,
Ever heard of beginnersU+2019 luck?,
Adrenaline-fuelled ability, perhaps?,
Heightened senses?,
With all this, she still decides that Harry should be in the Quidditch team.10 .,
Continuing the theme of complete and utter Sueness: FREE BROOMSTICK!,
Not only that, itU+2019s the latest in broomstick technology.11 .,
He got given his broomstick by a teacher .,
I will leave you to guess the phrase that applies here .,
Starts with U+2018tU+2019 and ends with U+2018eacherU+2019s petU+2019 .,
Wow .,
You got it .,
Tell me, have you applied for Mensa yet?12 .,
He then impresses everybody on the Quidditch team with his special specialness to such an extent that heU+2019s likened to the greatest Quidditch player in a hundred years (who was also definitely older than Harry when he played Quidditch).13 .,
Invisible cloak .,
HeU+2019s got all this, and then to add to it, he gets an invisible cloak.14 .,
HeU+2019s smart.15 .,
HeU+2019s brave.16 .,
HeU+2019s good at magic .,
These last three combined are a Sueness Overload in themselves.17 .,
And yet, even with all these qualities, heU+2019s so generous and brave, is purported to have such good judgement, etc., that you feel as if the urge to like him is being shoved down your throat, stirred until properly combined, and left to set for three hours.18 .,
This is the part that made me almost throw up: Hermione, for no good reason, throws her arms around Harry and tells him how great he is, and that sheU+2019s basically not worth half of what he is .,
Just stuff some more Sueness down our throats, why donU+2019t you, J?19 .,
Harry just escaped major Sue-ity again because Neville LongbottomU+2019s final points are the ones that win Gryffindor the House Cup/Trophy/thing .,
Still, Ron and Hermione win a generic fifty points each .,
Harry, of course, has to get sixty .,
Minor Sue-ness.20 .,
Yeah, he loses Gryffindor a massive 150 points, but he gets it all back, doesnU+2019t he?,
Being treated like an outcast doesnU+2019t really seem to have made an impression on him at all.21 .,
Instead of being punished for heading into the third-floor corridor, he is rewarded .,
Now, make no mistake, I do see that there are times when we should break the rules for the right reasons .,
But surely, to maintain order, shouldnU+2019t the U+2018perpetratorsU+2019 be punished on the surface of things?,
Surely Harry should be given grunt work or detention or something, right?,
Wrong.22 .,
The way he was saved from the evil Lord Voldemort is by nothing other than Pure Love .,
*cue sparkles*23 .,
Dumbledore turns out to have given Harry the cloak .,
Surely, having been a teacher for many years, he would recognise what mischief kids get up to, and would really NOT want a boy whose friends include the brother of Fred and George Weasley to have access to an invisible cloak .,
Or, if it comes to that, any kid at all .,
T-E-A-C-H-E-R-S-P-E-T.I wouldnU+2019t care if HP only displayed a couple of these characteristics, but heU+2019s got the whole lot!,
The thing that really drives me up the wall is that surely this should be the ultimate guide for what not to do when writing a book, and yetU+2026 and yetU+2026 itU+2019s a bestseller .,
ItU+2019s not sour grapes that keep me writing this post .,
ItU+2019s sheer confuzzled amazement.The writing style is boring and forgettable .,
No description to speak of, no real thoughts .,
There are some allusions to historical figures and terms, and so on, but they arenU+2019t presented in an interesting way .,
And couldnU+2019t we have at least met Nicholas Flamel?The morals in Harry Potter and the PhilosopherU+2019s Stone are negligible at best .,
ItU+2019s just me, me, me propaganda in disguiseU+2014one lying, sneaking, and even U+2018immobilisingU+2019 episode after another .,
And thatU+2019s from the so-called U+2018goodU+2019 characters.ClichU+00E9 after clichU+00E9 abounds in this book .,
ItU+2019s there in DumbledoreU+2019s white beard .,
ItU+2019s there in HarryU+2019s surprisingly quick Quidditch triumph .,
ItU+2019s there in Professor QuirrelU+2019s turban .,
And most of all, itU+2019s there in Draco Malfoy, a character so flat he couldU+2019ve been made out of paper and then run over with a steamroller and his original shape would have been slightly rounder.Added to which, the plot is so unoriginal .,
Can anyone say U+2018CinderellaU+2019?,
Orphaned child mysteriously left with a mean, boring family who doesnU+2019t want him and treats him terribly .,
Discovers that he really belongs to a world beyond his wildest dreams .,
And that heU+2019s very, very rich .,
Almost immediately, heU+2019s at home there .,
Sure, he has his enemies, but who doesnU+2019t?,
And they get dealt with anyway .,
Added to which, it turns out that his parents are super-cool.If thatU+2019s original, then IU+2019m Neville LongbottomU+2019s true love .,
Turns out everybody who keeps calling this original is Neville's honeybunchkins.I had to struggle to finish this book .,
Really struggle .,
I had it out from the library for nine weeks because I kept putting it down for ten days or so, then realizing I should probably finish it to see if it got better .,
IU+2019d pick it up and realise that IU+2019d forgotten what had happened before, meaning I had to go back to the beginning and start all over again .,
This, as you may well imagine, drove me nuts.Eventually, with the help of SparkNotes, I managed to figure it out and IU+2019ve just taken book 2 out of the library .,
IU+2019m wondering if it gets any better .,
After all, J.K. RowlingU+2019s run out of Cinderella storyline .,
Considering how much people love this series (to me at this point in time, they are inexplicably popular), IU+2019m not going to end with a pessimistic U+201CI donU+2019t think soU+201D .,
I might go with something more like this:ItU+2019s got to, right?,
Right---------*Disclaimer: As I am not at this point in time a Harry Potter fan, IU+2019ve probably gotten a couple of things wrong, although IU+2019ve checked and double-checked to the best of my ability .,
(If you see any errors, please comment and let me know.) However, even if a few things are a bit off, there are still about twenty points on this list .,

Friendship, Loyalty, Judgmental attitude, everything is somehow squeezed into it.The HP world: I've always felt that some of the best books are those which don't describe a lot and manage to tickle your imaginary bones .,
Yes, a lot of things have been minutely described, the look of the characters, some of the Hogwarts rooms, but there is a lot left out which somehow you piece together yourself, like Jenga, you know there are some missing pieces and you can picture the tower in its entirety if you want to!Characters: Even Hedwig seemed to have a personality of its own!,
And can we have some more Draco please?,
I loved the trio (I think they are called the golden trio?) Hermoine was so cute but I would stay so far away from such girls in school (because, you know, I so want to be Slytherin!) I couldn't help but relate a few of my school friends to Ron .,
Harry's character was a bit calm and I expect him to come out of his cave in the next book .,
The faculty was so intriguing, and now I know why Snape is so talked about .,
And shoutout to the Big Friendly Giant, Hagrid!Pace: I didn't really care about it .,
I'm not even sure if the book was fast or slow .,
It was well put together and something or the other was constantly happening .,

Son las mejores.I am 18 yrs late to this party and to make a review on this book in 2016 is probably silly .,
This was published few years after I was born and gotten its hype in the early 2000s, well based on where I'm from, Philippines .,
My cousins were so utterly obsessed on the films (apparently they're not into books, only me and my uncle loves to read) and they would watch HP films over and over again .,

I lost count on how many times they've watched it in our family room, every time they'd get .,
Back then I think they're crazy .,
The wizard world just did not interest me .,
I was into something only grown-ups were allowed to read .,
But I still did since I was fff excited to grow-up only to find out adulting is never fun at all .,
Also, what I was reading back then were works of Sidney Sheldon, and all those other crime-mystery novels I could easily get off of our shelf.Then there came the regret .,
*cringe*Not reading HP when I should have, years ago, was my choice .,
I guess the hype was to blame since everyone was talking about HP left and right and since I was a rebel, I did not gave-in .,
I also did not watched the films although we have all the CDs back home .,
I didn't know what I was getting myself into but what I now know was, although I've missed so much on enjoying this magical series when I was younger, I could still catch-up on it and experience it all, and feel like I'm a kid again .,
As cliche as it may sound, it never is too late for Hogwarts.I may have lost those years, but Harry Potter will always be there to bring me to a world where good triumphs evil, where friendship is true and gold, where everything is possible, and where Magic does exists.The illustrations in this book are stunning, and re-reading it with the images alongside the text for the first time brings a whole new experience .,
The perfect illustrator was chosen too in my opinion, with the artwork an excellent combination of cute, creepy, and magical .,
Cannot wait for the next books to all be released in this edition!,
This is less a review, and more a sort of miniature memoir of my Harry Potter experience .,
Gushy emotions and etc follow, so feel free to skip this review with no more than my recommendation that if you have not read this series you should do so immediately.Every so often when I'm sick in bed; a little depressed; or just generally cold and want nothing more than to snuggle up with blankets and forget the world for a few days, I go on a Harry Potter marathon .,

I read every single one of the books - in order - over the course of around two days (I've read them so often that I can devour them in almost a single go now) followed by as many of the films as I can fit into the time I have left, before I'm forced back into reality .,
I am one of the Harry Potter generation .,
I was four when this first book was published, fourteen when the series concluded, and around the same age as the characters in the films when they eventually came out .,
I still remember my mother insisting that I was too young to read this (at the age of 5) and hiding it under the sofa cushions so I could read in secret anyway.It's a series that I grew up with, and as such, cannot comment on its literary merits without bias .,
All I know is that these books are a comfort, and feel almost like family .,
They may not technically be the best books I have ever read, but for a reading experience they are truly unparalleled.30 Day Book Challenge, Day 3: Favourite series .,
(It has to be, there is no other series of books I've read this many times, and will read again another hundred .,
I can (and sometimes do) read the entire series in three days or less now, as I am so familiar with the words I can simply slip through them for the comfort of the story..)Oh go to hell .,
These things are like crack.So I just finished the 7th one and I have no intention of re-reading them, though I do have fond memories of them .,
My most recent encounter with Harry Potter was on an airplane a couple of days ago .,
This humongous 16 year old kid from North Dakota was sitting next to me reading the 5th book .,
He smelled like cereal and farts and was audibly mouth-breathing for the whole flight .,
I tried to engage him in conversation periodically to get his little whistleOh go to hell .,

He smelled like cereal and farts and was audibly mouth-breathing for the whole flight .,
I tried to engage him in conversation periodically to get his little whistle to quiet down for a few minutes at a time .,
We chatted about the little bastards at Hogrwarts and it kind of got me misty..not for the books, but for how terrible high school was even though I didn't realize it at the time .,
And this kid clearly didn't either .,
He just wanted to read his book and make it home .,
I wanted to tell him that in 10 years he wouldn't even remember what his goddamn school looked like .,
Instead I tried to convince him that what he heard about Dumbledore dying in the 6th one wasn't true .,
Stay strong, brother .,
Reread: December 7, 2015 This time I used an audiobook narrated by stephen fry and although I found some voices weird, I like most of it and will continue listening to it until I finish all of the 7 books!,

I was introduced to the world of Harry Potter at the age of eight when I watched the first Harry Potter movie .,
I was enthralled .,
When I turned nine, I noticed that many of my classmates were carrying around these huge books, so I decided to pick up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .,
I can honestly say it changed my life .,
Before HP I did like to read, but it wasn't really all that big of a deal to me .,
When I finished the first Harry Potter book, it was like a spell was cast on me (hehe) .,
I went out and got the rest of the books immediately and I flew through each one .,
When there were no more HP books to read, I went into a sort of withdrawal, counting down the days until the next installment became available .,
I went and watched all the movies on opening weekend .,
I was utterly obsessed .,
The thing that I am most grateful for is the love of reading that was instilled in me as a result of JK Rowling's books .,
Once I got a taste of the excitement of reading, I couldn't stop .,
And that, my friends, is why reading is now my favorite thing to do .,
That is why I began to write my own stories, plays, and poems, and am currently working on a novel that I hope to publish one day .,
I owe all this to JK Rowling .,
I can't thank her enough for what her books have done for me .,
The story of Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old boy horribly abused and neglected by his "family," if you can even call the Dursleys a family, was one that saddened me when I first read of it .,
It still saddens me to this day .,
Still, as a little kid, whenever I went through some hard times, I always told myself that Harry had it worse than me and he endured .,
I aspired to be like Harry .,
If he could deal with the Dursleys, then I could deal with whatever life threw at me .,
Harry Potter is the kind of kid I would love to have as a friend .,
He's brave, humble, and loyal .,
I find myself forgetting that he's a fictional character as I read, but at the same time wishing with all my heart that I could meet someone like him .,
And then we have Ron .,
Ron was hilarious, what with his dry humor and sarcasm that never came across as bitter or like he was trying too hard .,
While I noticed that he was self-conscious about his family's financial situation, he wasn't all "woe is me" about it .,
He was a good and loyal friend to Harry.As for Hermione, I adored her .,
I found myself connecting with her on such a personal level .,
I could relate to almost everything she went through .,
I also happen to have a mane of bushy brown hair, brown eyes, buck teeth (before I got braces), and a love of books and libraries .,
I too am a huge goody-two-shoes that many people would consider smart .,
But most of all, I have a habit of shooting my hand up in the air every time a teacher asks a question .,
Snape would probably despise me .,
Hermione was practical, smart, responsible, and a great friend .,
Her amazing cleverness and skill in magic is even more commendable because of the fact that she's Muggle-born .,
She'd had no prior experience with magic of any kind before coming to Hogwarts, and still she came out top of her class in her first year .,
Take that, Draco!,
Speaking of Draco, allow me to rant about the obnoxious git .,
He was the most contemptible, pompous, jealous, spoiled little brat I've ever encountered in a book .,
He seemed to have absolutely nothing better to do than follow Harry and his friends around and ruin their lives in any way possible .,
Ugh .,
Someone needs to hit this kid .,
Still, there's a part of me that feels bad for Draco too .,
I think all of his hatred for Harry and his friends is really jealousy .,
Think about it this way .,
Harry had great friends, Draco has dumb, mean cronies .,
Harry is famous, Draco doesn't get any attention .,
Harry's great at quidditch, Draco's not really good at anything (though he does excel in douchebaggery) .,
While the bad still outweighs the good, we have to remember that he's just a lonely, jealous kid that needs to lash out at someone.Now lets talk about one of my favorite characters: Severus Snape .,
I love him .,
Is that so wrong?,
I adore that man .,
My opinion of him has never changed .,
Sure, I knew he was a jerk in all the books and I got so angry at him at those times .,
At the same time, though, I was thoroughly amused by his sarcastic, caustic wit .,
You have to admit, he's funny, mysterious, complex, and even sexy, in his own weird way .,
As I continued with the series, I grew stronger feelings for him .,
Stronger annoyance at his bouts of meanness, stronger understanding of why he did what he did, and finally, in the last book, a stronger love and respect of his character .,
The first time I read Sorcerer's Stone, I was so confused!,
Did he hate Harry or didn't he?,
Was he trying to kill Harry or save him?,
This is what I love most about Snape .,
The inner machinations of his mind are an enigma (if you know where that line is from, go buy yourself an ice cream) .,
Then we have Hagrid: the sweetest, cutest giant of them all .,
I love his adorable accent, his love of deadly animals, and how much of a great father figure he is for Harry, Ron, and Hermione .,
I think his ludicrous belief that deadly creatures are actually harmless stems from his own personal experience .,
At first Hagrid seems threatening and hostile because of his size and wild appearance, when really he is a huge sweetheart .,
In this way, he feels he can relate to the dangerous creatures that he loves .,
Except the majority of these creatures don't turn out to be sweethearts like Hagrid.As for the Dursleys, I cannot deal with them .,
I despise these people .,
Can't stand them for the life of me .,
Somehow, I almost find myself hating them more than I hate Voldemort, especially Petunia .,
God damn it woman, this kid is your BLOOD relative .,
He is your sister's son, and you treat him like a prisoner .,
You wouldn't even treat strangers that way!,
As much as I despised this family, I found them funny as well, particularly Vernon's angry explosions .,
And last, but most certainly not least, there is Albus Dumbledore .,
I love him for his cute craziness, as well as his wisdom .,
I've never seen a better combination of the two .,
He is a wonderful father figure for Harry .,
Still, the mystery surrounding him frustrates me .,
What did he see in the Mirror of Erised, dammit?!,
The world will never know.All in all, this series remains my favorite of all time .,
Thank you, JK Rowling, for all you've done for me and for millions of other people all over the world."Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."Very true, isn't it?My words while reading: stunning, terrific. .,
(can't stop myself from praising this book)One of the best books ever!,
My emotions are still in the influence of this book's ending .,

He lives with his uncle and aunt (I didn't like them as they were so rude with Harry), who don't tell him he is a WIZARD!,
Even though they knew it.My Feelings--- A very appealing and effective character .,
I liked him very much.One thing I didn't like about him: (view spoiler)[ I was expecting some more magic from him but he didn't do more then once or twice, as much as I remember .,
(hide spoiler)]RonBio--- One of Harry's best friends.My Feelings--- A good one .,
I also liked him almost as much as I liked Harry .,
HermioneBio--- Also one of Harry's best friends .,
She has a very brilliant mind .,
My Feelings--- Actually, I didn't get any feelings while reading her .,
I don't know why?,
Although she is very well written .,
But I liked her dialogues with Ron .,
That's sort of..HUMOROUS.VoldemortBio--- A bad wizard .,
Main antagonist of this series, I assume and the killer of Harry's parents .,
He also tried to kill Harry but couldn't and He vanishes after that and nobody knows where he is?My Feelings--- He seems a powerful antagonist I will ever read .,
he didn't appear much .,
This book just gives us the introduction of his existence .,
But I am sure I will enjoy reading him in the next books.Albus Dumbledore(Headmaster of Hogwarts) and Hagrid(Keeper of Hogwarts) .,
Both of them seem nice persons to me.OVERVIEWHarry finds out he is a wizard when Hagrid gives him the letter from Hogwarts for admission .,
Harry's life changes completely while studying in Hogwarts when they(Harry, Ron and Hermione) run across the forbidden section of the 3rd floor of Hogwarts .,
(view spoiler)[ There is a stone named Sorcerer's Stone which can extend your life and transform any material into gold .,
This stone is hidden in that section of the 3rd floor and a dog(who is very big in size and have three heads), and many enchantments are guarding it .,
(hide spoiler)]A very big spoiler: (view spoiler)[ Voldemort is after this stone because he becomes too week after killing trying to kill harry .,
If he gets the Stone he will become powerful, again .,
(hide spoiler)]THINGS I LIKEDEverything!,
from beginning to ending except for one minor thing (see next section).QuidditchI liked this sport a lot .,
When I came to know about it I thought "Author will skip this and announce the winner" BUT author wrote this sport in such a brilliant way that I want more on this sport .,
There is a book on this and I will read that book soon.Last ChapterJust one line: "Anyone can betray anyone."This book contains a good deal of very entertaining scenes .,
I liked the imagination of author.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE (not that much)Nicolas Flamel's IntoductionThis book took little long time to introduce Nicolas (friend of Dumbledore and (view spoiler)[the maker of Sorcerer's Stone (hide spoiler)]), 2 chapters (arround 30 pages) .,
I couldn't like it much because Harry was wondering he had heard/read that name before but he didn't remember it right now .,
I can understand .,
BUT 2 CHAPTERS!,
Seriously!,
Even though we knew where Harry had read that name .,
In the train when he was coming to Hogwarts .,
It didn't look good to me or I couldn't find any fair reason to make this topic that long.I didn't completely hate that fact .,
I liked it but not that much I liked the whole things in the book.RECOMMENDATIONEveryone should read it regardless of their tastes, I mean, favourite genre .,
I don't think there would be a person on this planet (silly thing to say) who would dare to hate this book .,
I have become a very big fan of this series .,
It is not a surprise who wouldn't be .,
I highly recommend this book to those who hasn't started reading .,
This book would be a great start for them.CONCLUSIONI must say author has done a good deal of hard work .,
She wrote every scene in such a way that there would be no need of any visual form of this .,
I could visualize every scene of this book very easily while reading .,
I didn't thought I would read this type of writing style after Rick Riordan's .,
She is on second position in my list of Author's-Writing-Style .,
SORRY!,
I can't replace Rick Riordan's style with anybody's .,
I liked his style more than anybody's .,
I am really looking forward to read Parcy Jackson series BUT you know, 2 series of 10 books (5 in each) is more than enough books for me to read right now .,
BUT Sooner or later I will read that series too.According to fact I mentioned above, I would like to give:**** 5 Lifelong Shinning Stars ****Point out my mistakes and my misunderstanding about this book if there are any .,
I would be happy to see that!Thanks for your attention!QUOTES I LIKED"He didn't know what was going to - but it had to be better than what he was leaving.""..hard work and pain are the best teachers..""Petrificus Totalus!""It was one of those occasions when the true story is even more and exciting than the wild rumors.""..you couldn't have everything in life.""'The truth' Dumbledore sighed .,

I re-read it at least 5/6 times and growing up I found it every time more entertaining and meaningful .,
The world is amazing, the characters are amazing (every single one), the story is amazing, everything is amazing xDI think almost everyone knows the story. .,
So no plot/summary from me hahaThis series is and will ever be a HUGE part of my life and everything started with this particular book.Last but not least: The illustrated edition, which is stunning!,
The pictures are just eye candy, I like how it's written in columns and the full page illustrations are everything awww ** (The illustration of Quirrell is pretty disturbing and I LOVE IT xD)Sorry if it was a little messy, it's probably not even a review lol but I wanted to share a little piece of myself with you :')Yes, I realise I already own two copies of this book BUT this one is illustrated - that makes all the difference surely?,
It can't possibly be wrong to buy a book that looks this beautiful can it?As soon as I saw images of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: Illustrated Edition I knew I had to have it, as a huge fan of the series and someone who already owns several print versions as well as the ebook of each Harry Potter story there was no way I could miss out on this beautiful new editionYes, I realise I already own two copies of this book BUT this one is illustrated - that makes all the difference surely?,

There is absolutely no point in me writing another review of the story (you can read my original one HERE) because I'm pretty sure that most of the people who are going to be looking at buying this book are already going to be Harry Potter fans so instead I'm going to focus on the quality of the book and the illustrations.To put it simply this book is STUNNING .,
I had high expectations but was totally blown away by how beautiful this book is, it brings back the magical feeling of reading Harry Potter for the first time and I think it's definitely a perfect edition to read with children .,
Jim Kay has done a fantastic job of giving new life to the characters, he's managed to make them his own (which must have been quite hard to do considering how well everyone knows the actors from the movies) while still making them instantly recognisable.The book itself is a lot larger than I expected and has me wondering if they'll have to publish the later books in more than one edition .,
The quality is brilliant with lovely glossy pages and gorgeous illustrated end pages .,
This is the kind of book that you want to treasure and it would make a perfect gift for any Harry Potter fan .,
I can't wait to see the illustrated editions of the rest of the series and will definitely be purchasing them as soon as they're published.I'm going to finish this review with a couple of pictures so you can see just how beautiful some of the illustrations are: Harry in the cupboard under the stairs An owl delivery The Sorting Hat Beautiful end pages It wasnU+2019t much of a shock when the world learned, upon the completion of the Harry Potter octology, that J.K. Rowling was formerly a high ranking agent in MI6 .,

In the early U+201890s the UK was just emerging from the shadow of Thatcherism and a dozen years of painful domestic reform; the Soviet Union had issued its dying fetid breath and the resulting power vacuum offered a unique opportunity for the country to return to its former glory .,
RowlingU+2019s memoranda and comminiquU+00E9 had always leaned towards the florid; she was the natural choice when the nationU+2019s intelligence agency decided to U+201CretireU+201D one of their most decorated agents and move her into a new role .,
It turned out to be one of the greatest propaganda coups in Western Civilization.The formerly defunct MI7, created specifically in the early 1900s for the type of work Rowling would be asked to do, was clandestinely revived with the resources to support a lone agent with a singular purpose: create a new British hero .,
What they did not want was a James Bond reboot - a cavalier, womanizing anti-hero that righted the worldU+2019s ills at the draw of a gun .,
The new world required a new kind of icon, someone with whom the pre-teens of the U+201890s could relate .,
U+201CIU+2019ve got this,U+201D Rowling was rumored to have said .,
A classic understatement, in every sense.Book One of the Potter series establishes all of the important tropes and themes that any propogandist worth her salt would employ .,
Rowling even put her prowess at anagrams to good use .,
Harry Potter: Try Hero Part .,
HarryU+2019s feckless aunt, representing the American hegemony, is a personal favorite .,
Petunia Darsley: Easily Upturned .,
Potter is the offspring of two famous practitioners of magic, their deaths representative of the twin pasts of former British rule: supremacy of international commerce and the resulting colonialism .,
The young Harry doesnU+2019t know about his past - he must learn about it in a classic unfolding narrative that reveals how special he (i.e .,
the UK) really is .,
The tutelage and mentorship of Hogwarts has been shown to be a thinly veiled allusion to the European Union .,
Online chatrooms and water cooler discussions over the past 20 years have been filled with opinions on which EU member is represented by Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, etc. - suffice to say that it is another testament to RowlingU+2019s brilliance that she has never offered any opinions to the discussions; allowing the punters their pet views, however misguided, only strengthened the allegory.It is said that the creation of the storyU+2019s villain was RowlingU+2019s most difficult task .,
To take on the USA directly, the UKU+2019s closest ally and the last global power, was strictly off limits .,
Still, that didnU+2019t stop the speculation that America was indeed the antagonist (the whole U+201CdonU+2019t-speak-his-nameU+201D thing taken too literal), but as declassified documents have shown, RowlingU+2019s intention from the start was for Voldemort to be the representation of all the evilU+2019s of British past, for if the UK was to ever achieve its new ascendancy, it must first not be afraid to speak - and acknowledge - its former horrors; it must learn from those mistakes and grow strong with the help of its new world allies in hope of one day achieving that new Golden Age of the British Empire.From time to time I play a "What if?" game with my sister (view spoiler)[Yes, we're both adults (view spoiler)[Sort of .,

It is a fast, easy read, but like I said earlier it was defiantly written for someone younger.I would give this book a 3.5 stars, so I am rounding it up to 4 stars!What can I possibly say about Harry Potter?,
The boy who made everyone, whether child or adult, fall in love with him?,
Everything has been said..I just want one of those..So I can..And then I will..Because..I loved this book, I loved how there was a mystery that Harry had to solve among being new to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry .,
It was beautifully written, and although marked as a "Childrens book", I being a teenager still loved it .,
When you find out the teacher that was working for Voldemort I gasped so loud my mother received a noise complaint .,
I read it in the summer and finished it in a matter of days .,
Overall: 5 starsI have only seen the Harry Potter movies up to now, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first book in the series .,
I actually liked reading this more than seeing the movie of it.This was great .,
I can't believe I've waited so long to read it. .,
better late than never, I suppose .,
Review to come, and expect to see another six HP reviews from me in the coming months!There's no words :') I think I love this book more every time I read it!Tornare ad Hogwarts U+00E8 sempre un toccasana..I'm the only person in the world with mixed feelings about the Harry Potter books .,
Most readers love them .,
There are non-readers who are indifferent to them as they are to all other books; others who go solely by the fact that they're "children's" books and therefore believe it's ridiculous for adults to read and enjoy them; and of course a legion of similarly anti-literacy folk who have decided the Harry Potter books are immoral .,

Lewis, and storiesI'm the only person in the world with mixed feelings about the Harry Potter books .,

These people, who read and enjoy Tolkien, C.S .,
Lewis, and stories about Merlin and King Arthur, have concluded that the Potter universe is an evil place because it has magic and witches .,
All righty, then .,
I suppose there are readers who genuinely dislike the Harry Potter books .,
I haven't come across them, but they must be out there somewhere .,
And of course there must be readers who say they dislike them when what they mean is, they're wildly jealous that they didn't write them.I don't belong in any of those categories .,
I admire the fine writing, characterization, dialogue, and world-building Rowling has done .,
And exactly because her writing is so good, the one flaw I've found pains me to the point that I can't read these with the pure pleasure they give so many others.The only person I've talked to about this who's been willing to listen long enough to understand what I'm saying is the one person I know who hasn't read the books and has no plans to .,
He thinks I make a valid point .,
Everyone else I've attempted to engage on this topic has responded, "You're saying something bad about Harry Potter .,
You must be bad .,
I hate you .,
Please leave my home." Or words to that effect .,
I'll grant you that accepting flaws in things we love is a little-taught skill in this world .,
It's almost as rare as seeing good qualities in those we hate .,
This is as true with books as it is with people, and it's tragic .,
I have yet to meet someone who can acknowledge the admirable qualities of books they can't stand .,
I don't mean genuinely bad books, the kind that will be pulped a year after they were printed (if they last that long) or that will never make it to paper in the first place not because technology is awesome but because *nobody* wants to waste the paper on these works .,
No, I mean books that have stood the test of time but who have as many haters as lovers.Perfect example: Little Women .,
People adore this book, or they despise it.Listen up: "Little Women" is corny, mawkish, and sentimental .,
It's also wise, funny, and strong .,
Whether you like the book or you hate it, if you can't admit that all of this is true and this can all be true at the same time about the same book, you have a serious ego problem .,
You can't admit that the book you love could have anything wrong with it .,
("Krinkle, krinkle, 'ittle 'tar"?,
Really?,
That's not cringe-inducing?,
Calling a grown woman "Marmee" isn't cringe-inducing?,
Having the one black child at Jo's school for boys be the best singer isn't seriously cringe-inducing?) .,
Or else you refuse to entertain the idea that anything you hate could have anything right about it .,
(Marmee's advice to Meg about the difference between the flashing tempers of the March girls and the temperament of the man Meg married stands the test of time very well, as do plenty of the other observations of humanity -- when Jo laughingly admits that she's well enough to go on a carriage ride with Laurie, but not well enough to do disagreeable chores, and then karma kicks her in the arse .,
Which it tends to do a lot in this book.)Put your ego aside when thinking about and discussing literature .,
Good books are not saints .,
They should be admired, enjoyed, learned from, and reread; but they should also be critically examined .,
And if I've done all that with the Harry Potter books and I've found something I think is a serious flaw, it would be nice to be able to discuss that, rather than be glared and yelled at (yes, both have happened, and yes, I'm still angry) because I have the unmitigated gall to find something wrong with Saint Jo.For anyone who's still reading: I'm very uncomfortable with one aspect of the world Rowling has created .,
Specifically, I don't think her justification for hiding the existence of magic from the world of ordinary humans stands up well in a court of ethics.This is a review of the first book, so I'll only go into what she says here .,
When Harry Potter first learns who is parents really are, Hagrid is furious at the Dursleys for not having told him anything about what he calls Harry's world .,
"Our world, I mean .,
Your world .,
My world .,
Yer parents' world." It's terribly wrong not to have told Harry who and what he is, and who and what his parents were .,
Agreed .,
How, then, is it all right to hide what is, after all, the real world from the majority of its inhabitants?,
How is it all right to scorn them for not having magic while at the same time doing everything to keep them from knowing magic exists?Don't say there's no scorn .,
"Muggle" is hardly a term of endearment .,
(Yes, I'm jumping ahead of myself and I promised I wouldn't, but "mud-blood" is nothing but an extension of the condescension contained in "Muggle.") And as for the attitude towards the mundane world, look at Hagrid -- one of the good guys, certainly, and a very appealing character:"Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way .,
He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.'I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,' he said, as they climbed a broken-down escalator."We manage because you won't let us do otherwise .,
And then you sneer at the job we do.Let me ask you something: Do you really believe that "separate but equal" can be both?,
That's not how it works in the real world, and it's not how it works in Potter's world .,
The magical beings there are an elite minority, and they like it that way .,
They have the power .,
They're hanging on to it by force (more about that in later books), even when that puts the inhabitants of the mundane world at risk (WAY more about that in later books).Let me ask you something else: If you read and enjoy Austen's novels in the way that many people do -- taking pleasure in imagining yourself a member of that world -- you imagine yourself as one of the genteel, right?,
Not one of the servants .,
We see very little of them, and they have miserable lives .,
The power situation in Austen's time was horribly imbalanced and unfair .,
Austen wasn't in much of a position to do anything about it; but at least she didn't have her characters brag all the time about how awesome it was to be of the land-owning class, and how pathetic those stupid servants are.In fact, the one character I can think of who does complain about servants is Aunt Norris, and she's an out-and-out villain .,
Her observations on the serving class are meant to reinforce just what a nasty piece of work she is.One person I know claimed that in the Potter universe, the magic-users keep their existence and powers a secret in order to protect themselves .,
That's contradicted later -- I think in book #3, in which Harry reads a textbook about how much real witches enjoy being burned at the stake because it tickles and doesn't do them any harm -- but for now I'll just point out what Hagrid says when Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic "keeps it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country.""Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems .,
Nah, we're best left alone."If Rowling wanted to make a universe in which a failed attempt had been made in the past to live on equal terms with the non-magic world, and that attempt had led to great suffering and many lives lost on both sides, that would be perfectly tenable .,
(And fascinating .,
Somebody, write that book .,
Okay, I will.) If she wanted to claim that magic-users would be persecuted by the ordinary humans, and the magicians might have the magic but the mundane world had the sheer numbers and a lot of nasty technology on their side, that would certainly work .,
And then I could read these books without a qualm.Instead, she's created a world in which a ruling class cheerfully admits that they like having all the really cool stuff and they're jolly well not going to share with those foolish mortals who are so stupid, they have to struggle up broken escalators.What troubles me even more than her making this decision (which, as I've pointed out, is not the only way to go if you want to have a world of hidden magic) is how enthusiastically her readers have embraced it .,
There are "No Muggles Allowed" posters and Facebook pages .,
Created and enjoyed by people who don't seem to realize that, just as they'd more likely be a servant than gentility in Austen's world, odds are good they'd be Muggles in Rowling's .,
People who have felt odd and left out all their lives naturally embrace the idea that secretly, they're special and strong -- magical, even .,
I only question the idea that having wonderful abilities has to go hand in hand with lording it over those who don't .,
How is the Potter universe's attitude toward non-magic users any different from Malfoy's gloating over his entirely inherited monetary wealth, and sneering at Ron's poverty?I'm very uncomfortable with the Potter universe because I don't have the ego to believe I'd be one of the special ones .,
I'm rereading these with my son because he doesn't remember them very well and his grandmother kindly lent us an entire hardcover library of the British editions .,
This journey has its pleasures, but it's the last I'll take to the Potter world .,
It's no place for Muggles.UPDATE: I'm now about a hundred pages into the British edition of the last Harry Potter book, and I'm already seriously considering rereading the whole series just to have the entire, incredibly complex plot fresh in my head for once .,
Yes, the things that bug me philosophically about this series still bother me; but the writing is just too good for even cranky old me to resist .,
The audio book was a whole new experience U+2764 U+FE0FBrillante!!!,

This is the magical place where book worms are born!!HP turns reluctant readers into series bookworms and devourers of book series, and this is true for my eleven year old daughter .,
I began reading the Harry Potter series to her two years ago and she quickly fell in love with the HP world and characters .,
She laughed, cried, celebrated with and cheered for HP and his friends .,
She can even remember the names of each of the characters in the whole series!,
Reading Harry Potter has opened up a world of books for her and now she's reading Gail carriger's Waistcoats & Weaponry book three in the Finishing School series and she has already finished reading The Naughtiest Girl in the School series, a few YA (middle grade) paranormal books, The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset and my YA horror book Warm Bodies, and she loved it!,
I think my little bookworm is about to raid my stash of books and I better move my romance/grown up books out of the way until she's a bit older.Once again, I finished reading Harry Potter and Philosopher's Stone but this time I read it with my nine year old son .,
He's a reluctant reader who loves the outdoors and computer games so I decided to use HP to improve his reading skills and perhaps help him discover love of books.He loves watching the HP movies (only the first three) but this is the first time he has read Harry Potter and Philosopher's Stone and he tells me the book is better than the movie!,
I'm so proud of him!,
He's upset the movies left out Peeves the Poltergeist, the prankster ghost and his new favourite character .,
He's already quoting The Philosopher's Stone (and he's adding a few twists of his own) and it's pretty funny and adorable!,
We've already started Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, It's going to take us a long time to finish the HP series but it'll all be worth it in the end .,
Already a new generation is discovering the phenomenal, magical and beautiful series that is Harry Potter and I'm so happy to play a small part in this discovery .,
J.K. Rowling's, humour, incredible, imaginative and easily accessible writing skills makes reading HP is as easy as..U+201CSwish and flick.U+201D Awful in every way .,
The whole book is centered on lame, even deplorable ideas .,
First, it divides people into the wizardly and the non-wizardly in a class system .,
That's a fairly lame idea already, but other than deriding some of the snobby elitists among the wizardly class, it is itself ridiculously elitist, presenting its only non-wizardly people as an overblown, idiotic parody of middle class small-mindedness, conformity, and materialism, and making the elevation into the wizard class anAwful in every way .,

Second, it makes the magical into the mundane .,
Otherworldly and magical things, things beyond the everyday, are trivialized by transposing them into a world of magic shops and wizard schools essentially no different from non-magic shops and non-wizard schools .,
(It doesn't help that all the magical things are stock s, with absolutely no originality or imagination.)Outside its center of lameness, the book fails in all its basic storytelling s .,
It's written in a completely standardized kids-book style, full of simplistic exaggerations, stock phrases, and twee comments from the narrator .,
Even if that style didn't irritate me with its obviousness and simplification, it's utterly indistinct here: the words have no verve .,
It does nothing of note to create suspense, excitement, pathos, vivid imagery, or anything else .,
And the dialogue is flat and unnatural, lacking any distinct voices.Similarly, all its characters are clichesU+2014the know-it-all girl, the goofy, good-hearted guy, the classist snob, etc.U+2014that are given no definition or nuance beyond their stereotypes .,
Actually, they're so vague that they lack even the definiteness of their stereotypes .,
The villains are given still less: Snape is mean and punishes kids unfairly, Voldemort is evil and kills people, and that's it .,
And the characters' personality and feelings are related in the most simplistic ways .,
Harry Potter himself is just a cliched cipher of wish-fulfillment, the mistreated kid with no friends who's really the most special of all kids and destined for greatness.The overarching narrative is still another cliche: a journey away from home, in which kids learn and grow, and a move into an upper-class world full of possibilities and glamor and excitement .,
Within that, everything is just more lame cliches of school life and childhood friendships .,
There's also the kids being tested, doing some of that learning and growing, by foiling an evil plot .,
But the evil plot is painfully contrived (especially the ridiculous bit where all the characters conveniently get to show what they're good atU+2014blech), so undeveloped that it barely registers, and carrying no weight .,
It also revolves around the ultimate cliche of misdirection: the person you least expect did it!,
And he's a non-character, defined only by being nervous and stuttering enough to be the person you'd least expect.Finally, Quidditch is the stupidest sport ever.U+041E U+0431 U+0438 U+0447 U+0430 U+043C U+0442 U+0430 U+0437 U+0438 U+043A U+043D U+0438 U+0433 U+0430, U+043A U+0430 U+043A U+0442 U+043E U+043F U+044A U+0440 U+0432 U+0438 U+044F U+0442 U+043F U+044A U+0442, U+0442 U+0430 U+043A U+0430 U+0438 U+0441 U+0435 U+0433 U+0430, U+0441 U+043C U+044F U+0442 U+0430 U+043C, U+0447 U+0435 U+0442 U+043E U+0432 U+0430 U+0435 U+0441 U+0432 U+044F U+0442, U+043A U+043E U+0439 U+0442 U+043E U+0432 U+0441 U+0435 U+043A U+0438 U+0442 U+0440 U+044F U+0431 U+0432 U+0430 U+0434 U+0430 U+043E U+043F U+043E U+0437 U+043D U+0430 U+0435.Aviso antes de empezar que esta no es una reseU+00F1a especial ni el relato de cU+00F3mo comenzU+00F3 mi amor por la literatura .,

Nowadays, mainly girls, are reading stuff that are marketed for older and more mature readers, focused on topics they know nothing about yet and probably shouldn't read about due to not being ready to get the grasp of it and a whole, objective vision of their own after reading said stories (for example, "BDSM" stuff that in reality is not BDSM but a "how-to-be-abused-by-a-bastard" guide. .,
You know which book I'm talking about .,
And that one is not the only book with abuse being glamorized.) This book, even though it's not the very best written book ever, focuses on the value of friendship, family and team work .,
It portrays flawed, yet strong characters .,
And not only male characters, but also female, which is currently hard to find nowadays .,
Women, girls, are normally being depicted as weak and needy, whose only purpose is to serve love a man in order to find their lives complete, and whose happiness depends solely and exclusively in said man .,
And to get him, in many books friendship is torn apart just for the sake of getting their love interest .,
In my opinion, we're sending the wrong message to young girls .,
Many do believe that, indeed, they need a boyfriend to be happy .,
That if they don't have one, their worth is less or there's something wrong with them .,
Society itself promotes the message that if you're a woman and you don't get a man, you failed at life .,
All I can ask myself is why.In the other hand, Harry Potter shows brave characters, all in its own particular way .,
Characters that through each book continue to grow and develop .,
That's why I recommend anyone, young or not, to read these books .,

I couldn't find anything worth reading in the works of Stephenie Meyer (except that it had been published).Okay so I think I'm the only person standing on this earth who has not read the Harry Potter series yet, and here, this is my first ever book for J K Rowling .,

No regrets .,
Harry Potter is perfection.In times like this, when the world has gone to shit and I feel so lost and afraid, I turn to friends and the comfort of my own security .,
Harry Potter is my old friend, my security blanket .,
Listening to the audiobook, narrated by Jim Dale, for the first time .,
UPDATE: Still magical and hilarious .,
If you're not a Potterhead then CRUCIO to you ;-)Ahh this book brings me so much happiness .,
It says a lot when a story is just as good the 5th time around .,
I always forget how much dialogue they took directly from the book when making the first movie, it just proves how amazing J.K. Rowling is as a writer .,
Anyways, not much else I can say about this masterpiece..I always cry when Neville gets house points at the end!!"Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while .,

Oh look!,
A cute, funny children's book, just the right length, with a nicely constructed, self-contained plot and a good ending.Well, obviously we want to turn it into a huge, bloated, ridiculously self-important seven-volume series .,
Nothing else would make sense .,

It's a favorite of mine and I'm sure every bookworm who's out there can appreciate and understand the reason why.I was one of those little kids that run around dressed up like Harry .,
For the record, I really did .,
I would wear those round glasses and swish and flick my wand around and I took so pride in doing so.It took me some time to read the books because I didn't use to be a bookworm, I only started appreciating the magic of books, like two years ago .,
I read this last year and after seeing the movie countless times I still didn't feel like reading something forcefully or something I knew what its story was going to be, although I did.J.K .,
Rowling created a world that is so genuine, so detailed, so real .,
She took a word, magic, and she gave new meaning to it, creating spells, traditions to follow magic throughout this magnificent journey .,
She created these three real, passionate, and amazing characters that we all love and in a way we grew together .,
This is my childhood .,
No, not the books .,
But I was fan of the movies ever since the first one and maybe I wasn't one of the lucky ones to read the book from the beginning I still have a word at saying that we were lucky to grow up into the Harry Potter generation.This, as you all know, is the first novel in the series and it's an introduction mostly .,
Its size is not so big but trust me it's a wondrous book that makes every little kid's fantasy (and why not kid-grown ups) run wild .,
I love this and how juvenile it is .,
Harry, Ron, Hermione, they're all so cute and small, they're just little kids, chasing down the adventure.We all know who Harry and his sidekicks are .,
We all know about his lightning-shaped scar .,
We all know what he's been through when he was just a little boy.So, I dare you, if you're my age, 19 that is, and you're a fan of the movies but have never given this book the chance it deserves, read the hell out of it .,
It's never to late.Thanks for reading my review..more  .,
"I think we must expect great things from you, Mr Potter..After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Names did great things - terrible, yes, but great."The feels and memories this read has brought back is unreal .,
Can't say more than this is: From beginning to end ~ Everything was: Harry Harry my dearest Harry this book was you finding out who you are and that you were not just any ordinary boy .,
Harry Potter:  .,
Harry Potter has and always will have a special place in my heart, so my rating comes as no surprise .,
However, my rereading of the first book this time around was quite special because I read the recently published illustrated version .,
I must say that the illustrations very much enhanced the story and made it even more magical .,
They are unique because they don't look like what we see in the movies, but at the same time they were exactly as I would've pictured them to be .,

I know I loved it, and I can't wait till the second edition comes out .,
Harry Potter changed my life .,
If I hadnU+2019t read Harry Potter when I did I would not be the same person today .,
What I am today, in a part is due to Harry .,
I cannot really say enough to make you understand how much Harry Potter means to me .,
Publishers have my sympathy .,
If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize .,
I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range .,
If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number ofPublishers have my sympathy .,

If I hadn't had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time .,
And I've read it twice to my daughter, Celyn .,
We read the first 5 some years back, and now she's 12 we're going to read the whole lot .,
She's very disabled and can't read for herself (she can't hold the book or see the page for starters..) Having just finished I've checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2 .,
So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review. .,
I liked the book .,
I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children's book or why so many adults are so taken with it .,
JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily .,
She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child .,
Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences?,
If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn't been left to give the solution to the potion test . .,
or the key hadn't been left in the same room as the door that wouldn't yield to magic . .,
would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure?,
Yes . .,
it was more fun this way, but . .,
dammit . .,
kids aren't stupid..But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one. .,
it's all good .,
Celyn certainly enjoyed it .,
She's on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that 'muggles' are somehow lesser .,
That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we're invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so) .,
But all the time I read this I'm feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing .,
I will report back on book 2 when we're done .,
Es la primera vez que leo Harry Potter (lo sU+00E9, verdad?,
Pero oye nunca es demasiado tarde para leer un libro) y me ha encantado .,
HacU+00EDa la mitad del libro hubieron algunas partes que me aburrieron un poco pero lo demU+00E1s me gustU+00F3 y mucho .,
Tengo ganas de seguir leyendo las aventuras de Harry por que creo que acabarU+00E9 muy enamorada de esta saga .,
I am not going to review Harry Potter, that is just an impossible task .,
However, after reading many people's personal stories linked to Harry Potter I got inspired to share mine as well!,
It'll be a long and boring reminiscing..My childhood was not exposed to J.K.Rowling .,
In fact, Harry Potter remained untouched until I was 12 years old.I was an avid inhaler reader of spooky books .,
Many children at that age were probably attending Hogwarts already (Harry Potter was booming back then) but I wasI am not going to review Harry Potter, that is just an impossible task .,

In fact, Harry Potter remained untouched until I was 12 years old.I was an avid inhaler reader of spooky books .,
Many children at that age were probably attending Hogwarts already (Harry Potter was booming back then) but I was stuck in another planet where your worst nightmares can come to life .,
Other times, I'll be battling off angry ghosts from lighthouses, zapping aliens with laser guns, dodging dungeon trolls, wrestling off demonic doppelgangers, getting haunted by talking dummies and going back and forth from one dimension to the next .,
Sometimes, I was scouring places for clues to solve puzzling mysteries.I suppose you can say that my childhood was still just as adventurous minus witches & wizards & magical schools.Finally, I was burnt out from all my usual, preferable book series .,
I have completed all the Spooksville adventures Christopher Pike had offered, I've read The Book of Nightmares by John Peel countless times already that I made myself sick of it, I was dead tired of R.L.Stine's repetitions in his Goosebumps books, and I didn't own enough copies of The Secret Five series by Enid Blyton .,
I had nothing else to read aside from childish picture books .,
Then come one day when my sister came home with a bulging plastic bag from Times bookstore .,
When we spilled out the content together, there were 4 books and Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was among them.You see, when I was first introduced to Harry Potter, I did not start with The Sorcerer's Stone as I should have but instead, the starter book for me was The Chamber of Secrets (My sister was a bit of a noob at book buying .,
She didn't realize she bought the second book instead of the first!) .,
I remembered thinking how VERY ODD and UNIQUE this world of witchcraft & wizardry was .,
And believe me, I've read some strange stuffs before Harry Potter came into the picture.I knew I had missed out on a few details from the first book but I've watched the movies and they were enough to provide me the information I needed to know.Here's where the plot twist come to play - right after I was done with The Chamber of Secrets, I extinguished Harry Potter out of my mind .,
My sister and I did not want to own the rest of the books either .,
Plus, I simply wasn't that interested to continue reading and thought it was quite pointless to read the books when the movies were at my reach .,
(You are more than welcomed to kick the old me in the shins .,
I can't believe I was so unimaginative!)It was 4 years later, at 16, when I re-returned to this series .,
I was quite late to jump into bandwagon, I know but damn it, the last movie ended quite a while ago and I've rewatched and rewinded them all so many times than I can count .,
I fucking missed Harry Potter .,
Well, I was still side-eyeing the books mistrustfully but one day, when I was feeling rebellious, I bought the entire box set (my old copy of The Chamber of Secrets was long lost) and here I am, doing my 5th reread of the series.Stories are even more magical to read than to watch onscreen .,
That much I realized .,
I feel like kicking myself even as I write this for thinking, once, that the Harry Potter movies are better than the books .,
I didn't truly or fully apprecite the written words before but J.K.Rowling had given me a WAKE UP!,
call and I have her to thank for that.This being my fifth reread, I was worried the analytical reader in me will shred the book apart and nitpick every single details but to my surprise, I did not .,
I still love every single moment as much as I had the first time around .,
I still found The Dursleys reaction to magic hilariously comical, Hermione's and Ron's banters are adorable and rip-roaringly funny at times (oh, they were so meant to be) and I enjoyed J.K.Rowling's ability to weave up an entire new bizarre world with its own set systems and good lord, her food description is absolutely fantastic .,
My mouth waters even at the thought of Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Juice, Butterbeer and every single meals the house elves at Hogwarts have to offer .,
I'd even try a taste at Bertie Bott's Every Flavour beans.In a nutshell, this entire series is utterly magical (Need I say more?) and I won't ever forget this anytime soon .,
I am only 9 years late to the party, but I have finally started this series!!,

How could I not give this book 5 stars?,

ItU+2019s time for a little confession: I have survived eighteen years without ever having read any Harry Potter book or having watched any Harry Potter movie .,
I remember seeing glimpses of the third or fourth movie in my childhood on a friendU+2019s birthday, but thatU+2019s about everything which connected me with the world of Harry Potter .,
More recently, a friend of mine forced me to finally watch the movies, not understanding how I could still have had a relatively enjoyable childhood without the presenceItU+2019s time for a little confession: I have survived eighteen years without ever having read any Harry Potter book or having watched any Harry Potter movie .,
I remember seeing glimpses of the third or fourth movie in my childhood on a friendU+2019s birthday, but thatU+2019s about everything which connected me with the world of Harry Potter .,
More recently, a friend of mine forced me to finally watch the movies, not understanding how I could still have had a relatively enjoyable childhood without the presence of Harry Potter in it .,
So here I am, having read the first book approximately ten years too late, and regretting to never have read it before.The novel actually has a lot of flaws which I could start to criticize right now .,
But apart from the assumption that it would gain me some enemies, what would be the point of it?,
This book is magical exactly the way it has been written .,
Even its flaws made me laugh or at least chuckle, and during every other page of the book, I wanted to be a part of Hogwarts .,
I always thought of the HP series as being set in a world designed for children, but now I understand how wrong my thinking was .,
Furthermore, I canU+2019t stop comparing it to the Chronicles of Narnia, which are set in another magical world U+2013 yet the writing seems so much more childish .,
RowlingU+2019s style addresses children, teens and adults alike, and thatU+2019s what I admire most about her writing.IU+2019m only 57 days older than the first book of the Harry Potter series as of its publication date, yet it has needed 6746 days before I finally entered the world of Hogwarts along with Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Neville Longbottom and all the other well-known characters connected with the series, and two more days before I finished the first year in Hogwarts .,
The only possible way for me to make good for avoiding RowlingU+2019s book for such a long time is to read all the six following novels .,
Soon.And to await the arrival of my own Hogwarts letter .,
U+201CIt was agony to touch a person marked by something so good.U+201D I'm not going to attempt to review this book, but I'll leave you all with this .,
We all need a hug sometimes, especially after rereading Harry Potter .,
GOODREADS SUCKS!,
GOODREADS SUCKS!,
GOODREADS TOTALLY SUCKS!,
Why can't I rate this book a million or billion or even more than trillion of stars rating here on Goodreads?,
WHY?,
WHY?,
WHY?,
Five stars rating is absolutely not enough, solve this problem now, Goodreads!,
Or is there any option to give it that kind of rating?,
If there is, then, send me an owl.FULL REVIEW TO COME .,
Obviously 5 star .,
Again .,
The illustrations in this edition were absolutely stunning and I can't wait for the rest of them to be out!,
First read 1997Many many rereadsMost recent reread 2014Dear HarryI have been meaning to write this for a long time now .,
This isnU+2019t a review on your journey, this is simply my feelings and words I wish I could tell you .,
I still remember the first time I bought your first book .,
(I had to buy it again from another publication that actually continued with your books!) I had been without any interesting books to read for months and your book caught my attention since I had read about your popularityFirst read 1997Many many rereadsMost recent reread 2014Dear HarryI have been meaning to write this for a long time now .,
This isnU+2019t a review on your journey, this is simply my feelings and words I wish I could tell you .,
I still remember the first time I bought your first book .,
(I had to buy it again from another publication that actually continued with your books!) I had been without any interesting books to read for months and your book caught my attention since I had read about your popularity in Britain so I got all excited and bought the book immediately .,
People barely knew you where I lived and I can claim I was among the first who gave you a chance .,
At the time, your books werenU+2019t found easily anyway and werenU+2019t published all over the country .,
I read your book and I really liked it but I wasnU+2019t really in love .,
I did look forward to your second book and I was disappointed to find out that there were no copies available where I lived and your third book wasnU+2019t even out yet .,
I waited and waited and slowly word spread about you and the second copy appeared .,
I read it and..something changed .,
I was falling in love.There was a girl in my class that I barely knew .,
I recommended you to her, she read it and something changed between us too .,
More than 10 years later, she is still one of my closest friends .,
Just like that, you helped to connect us.I am not a genius but I found school days very boring .,
I was fine getting good grades without paying any real attention at the classroom and certain days were almost unbearable but then..you became a part of my life and I finally had you and your world to think about .,
I could think and fantasize about you, your journey, your future and I finally had a book to look forward to year after year .,
Time passed and my teenage years were spent with you .,
When I think back, you gave me some of my best memories from that time .,
Then came a time that almost anyone that read books, knew about you .,
I stumbled upon a new site that had been created by kids in my country and I started to talk with one of the admins .,
She was both a Harry Potter fan and a Lord of the Rings fan and we clicked immediately!,
I will never forget how she kept calling me by mobile phone when my family moved into a new house and I didn't have access to phones or Internet .,
She would talk to me for hours and helped me to keep my sanity!,
She moved to Japan a few years ago and I have very little contact with her now, but I will always remember her and what she did for me.Years later, as a university student, I met a pair of twin sisters .,
They were very very shy at the time, or should I say at first contact, and I didnU+2019t know how to connect with them or whether I even wanted to .,
Then we realized we all love you, we started talking about you and then found other things we all liked. .,
and today, they are my best friends, they always try to be there for me and I always try to be there for them .,
We have our differences but we also have our similarities and our love for you is one of them.Harry, thank you for letting me into your world .,
Thank you for becoming a part of my world .,
Thank you for being there when I needed you .,
Thank you for giving me these fun and treasured memories .,
Thank you for helping me find people like me .,
Thank you for everything!,
I will always cherish you.You live forever in my mind and my heart.Yours sincerely  .,

The first time I saw the movie, I was shocked!,
(Yeah, I watched the movies before reading the books, and the books are so much better than the movies, but it helped me a lot in imagining this magic world).Lets leave the characters now, what is this book particularly about?The Philosopher's/sorcerer's stone.What is this?Who owned this stone?Who protects it?Who want to steal it?,
and why?What will happen to the trio?Who is "You-Know-Who"?I won't tell, for sure .,

THEYAbsolutely fabulous!!,
I'm happy that I got to read an illustrated, non-altered version of Harry Potter year 1 .,

THEY LOVED IT!,
And now they are fixing to watch the first movie .,
I also found the illustrated version of book 2 "The Chamber of Secrets" (that was just released on 10/4/16) .,
So after they finish the first movie, we will be starting book 2 together!,
My kids are officially little wizards now and in love with the magical world of Harry Potter!,
I'm bouncing off the walls with happiness and can't wait to start book 2 with them!5 Stars. .,
No puedo creer todo lo que dure para animarme a leer este libro (culpo a las pelU+00EDculas por eso) es probablemente el mejor inicio de saga que he podido leer, sin duda de ese tipo de historias que te marca para toda la vida, creo que si no hubiera pelU+00EDculas el impacto (al menos en mU+00ED) hubiera sido mU+00E1s grande, pero aU+00FAn y con eso lo ame .,
I wasn't sure if I was going to write a review of these books, but I try to write a review of all of the books that I read, and it's been kind of nagging at me that I didn't write one for this .,
It's hard to write a review for a book that is so dang popular and well known .,
What is there to say that's new?,
I dunno .,
I think pretty much everything's been said, but still I wanted to write a review for this, and to talk about these books, even if I'm just rehashing everything that's already been done.I wasn't sure if I was going to write a review of these books, but I try to write a review of all of the books that I read, and it's been kind of nagging at me that I didn't write one for this .,

What is there to say that's new?,
I dunno .,
I think pretty much everything's been said, but still I wanted to write a review for this, and to talk about these books, even if I'm just rehashing everything that's already been done .,
I remember when these first came out, I never really wanted to read them .,
I thought of them as "kid's books" and even though I read YA, my overly-critical half just kept saying that these weren't for me .,
I don't know if it was the cover, or the insta-popularity of the books or what, but I didn't read them .,
I avoided them like the plague .,
Until a friend of mine was reading the 5th book, and was so engrossed in it that he would do the "..yes, yes, I'm paying attention.." nod while his eyes remained glued to the page .,
And as a reader myself, I know that look .,
So I asked to borrow the book he was reading, and he refused .,
He told me that if I was going to read it, I'd have to READ it, starting with the first book .,
So the next day, he lent me the first and second books, both of which I finished in record time, and then I understood .,
And I never looked back .,
There's something about these books that is just. .,
magical .,
Yeah, yeah, cliche, I know .,
But it's true .,
Yes, they are about magic, but they are about so much more than that .,
They are about love, and friendship and loyalty and trust and betrayal and commitment and all the things that we aspire to have and to be as humans .,
They are about understanding and forgiveness and learning who we are when it really matters .,
And all of these things are buried in this shell of fun and adventure and mystery that makes them irresistible .,
I decided to read these again in the original UK editions, because I know that the US editions were "Americanized", and I wanted to re-experience them in their true form .,
I dislike when things are changed from their original format, I hate abridgments and condensed versions etc. I want to experience the story how the author wrote it, how it was meant to be experienced without some guy in a suit somewhere trying to make it "accessible" to me .,
I like the feeling that I get of learning something of another culture through the words they use, and the meaning that they give the words .,
This is why they taught us reading comprehension in third grade, so that we can read and LEARN .,
Learning doesn't have to be boring and tedious, it can be fun if we allow it to be .,
But it seems that we've lost that ability .,
Sad .,
Anyway, I re-read the first book, now appropriately titled "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone", and I was surprised at how emotional I felt reading it, especially after knowing where it all ends .,
It was like seeing friends that you've missed for years again, and while it makes you happy to see them, it's also sad because you know they'll have to go again too soon .,
That's how I felt, like I was seeing friends and that my time with them is short .,
That's kind of a silly way to feel, because they are forever, and I can visit anytime I want to, but I felt that way anyway .,
Especially meeting Ron again .,
He's my favorite character for an absolute reason, which is because he is so loyal and funny and true, and he gives his whole heart when he gives it at all .,
I wish that there were more people like Ron .,
I can't wait to re-read the rest of the series and see if this feeling remains .,
I love discovering the hidden gems that Rowling has left for us to find, in mythology and history and legend and word-play and in life .,
Who wouldn't love these books?,
This book was given to me by an english chick in a hostel in Central America .,
It was supposed to make me want to read the rest of the catalogue; it did not .,
The worst part of this book is how stupid that stupid wizard game is .,
How do they not realize they should just save their energy until the end when the one ball that wins the game comes into play?,
It is infuriating to me that people play this game on quads across the country, a game that is intended to be played while flying on broomsticks.This book was given to me by an english chick in a hostel in Central America .,

Why do some children's books make some people think they are big readers because they are able to focus on children's literature .,
For my time, I will pick up Roald Dahl any day of the week over this series .,
Reread 19/04/15So glad I decided to reread this, it was just what I needed to get me out of this weird slump I was in!,
Just as amazing as the first time I read it!!,
J.K Rowling is queen  .,
Edit (December 5, 2015):First re-read I've ever done in my life .,
I must say, this book isn't quite the best thing in the world .,
It has many tropes I really hate (speshul snowflake, villain that only wants to take over the world for no reason, etc), but there's something magical about it and all those aspects for some reason make me smile.It's amusing how innocent everything was when it all started .,

Harry Potter is not my favourite series ever, or the one that has affected me the most (that place is saved for The Monstrumologist by Rick Yancey), but certainly it's one of the best and it kind of made my childhood (I grew up with the movies, actually, not with the books, but I was, in any case, attached to the story since a kid) .,
J.K., I'm sorry for saying you're not a goddess in my The Cuckoo's Calling review.______________________There's no way to properly review this thing, so I'm just gonna tell you how I met the Harry Potter series..There was a little girl named Vanessa who always wanted to do the contrary to what people wanted her to do .,
If she had a chore to do, she would do it as long as they let her alone .,
If mom or dad or one of her brothers or her sister or anyone in her family told her to do it, she would immediately refuse, because she takes no orders .,
She's her own boss.As she was like that, then if something was popular, she would not do/read/watch/whatever it .,
Well, there was this particular little series that everyone had read .,
It had movies and everyone loved them.Do you know what she did?,
She promised herself she would never read them .,
She had already watched the movies (the ones that were out) and she rather liked them, but she would not touch the books, because doing so would mean she was just like everyone else, and she was special (yeah, I was that arrogant).Some years later.October 15th, 2011.It was a gray day and it was her brother's birthday .,
Mother wanted to gift his son something that he would enjoy, but not videogames or stuff like that .,
She wanted something with more educational value - say, a book.Mother knew Vanessa's brother liked the HP movies (up until the sixth one), and as there was a book fair at his school (which was mine too), and the books upon which the movies were based were there .,
She bought the first and gave it to his son for his birthday.Some of her mother's friend had also given Vanessa's brother several of the other boks in the series .,
It seemed as if they had planned the whole thing.Of course Vanessa thought there was a hidden purpose there .,
She thought her mother had bought the books so she wouldn't resist on picking them (I told you I was arrogant, didn't I?).She was wrong .,
That was not her mother's purpose, but in the end, Vanessa couldn't resist the pull .,
She wanted and didn't want to read the books.Wanted them for some reasons:U+00B7 She had always been intrigued by them.U+00B7 She was the reader in the house .,
She couldn't stand the fact that her brother (who hated - and still hates - reading) was going to read more books than her (don't even tell me).U+00B7 A "friend" of hers was bragging she had read the HP books in less than one week and she wanted to prove her she could do the same.Didn't want them for some reasons:U+00B7 Reading them would mean she was a common girl (I was an insufferable 13-year-old girl - don't blame me).U+00B7 She would break her promise if she read them.U+00B7 If she read them, she would do what everyone else wanted her to do, and as you know, she hates being told what to do.After a long time of deep philosophizing (aka one day), she decided she would read them .,
What could be the worst thing to happen?It turns out she loved the first book .,
Her reaction upon starting it was something like this:After that, she wanted the next ones .,
She borrowed the books from his brother and read them all up to the 5th one (those were the ones we had) in one week .,
She felt sorry for not doing it any sooner..Yeah, I was and still am like that .,
I'm really glad I decided to read the books .,
They all have amazing plots, fantastic character development, writing that improves over the books, great story and world building, etc. What else can I need?,
"There are all kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, smiling."It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends."I love this book, with all my heart .,
That's why this review is so hard to write .,
Who has never heard about Harry Potter, the guy who lived?,
I always say that the The book thief was the first book I have ever read, but then, there's this one .,
That I read sooo long ago, that I didn't remember a single thing about it .,

That I read sooo long ago, that I didn't remember a single thing about it .,
I know all almost all lines by head because I've watched the movie thousands of times, but there's nothing like reading the book .,
It's like myself talking to my brother after I finished it:Me: Gu, (his name is Gustavo - when we went to the USA, nobody understood his name .,
Is that an unusual name?) did you know that after Ron plays chess, there was another test?,
A potion one?,
My brother: REALLY?,
Why wouldn't they show that at the movie?,
I bet it was amazing, potions and all .,
Hermione solve it, right?,
Imagine if I guessed it correctly like her?,
Me: Don't know, Gus .,
Would you read the book, then?,
There are thousands of things you will only know about HP if you read itMy brother: Nah, I hate reading .,
My point is: like myself before I reread this, my brother and other people who never read this book and only watched the movie will never know the things that also happened .,
LIKE HOW MANY TIMES NEVILLE IS PRESENT ON THE SCENES!,
How Hermione is way geekier, Ginny is SO young, the way Hagrid speaks .,
And still, there are things that never seizes to amaze me about these books: friendship, loyalty, love, magic .,
They are present in every page of this, every scene, every line .,
The way Hermione becomes their friend was always one of the things I liked the most .,
She's so different from Harry and Ron, and still, she fits .,
She learns, she takes risks, she goes with Ron and Harry in their adventures because she is brave, in her own way .,
She has a heart of gold, like my mom used to say, just like Harry .,
"There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them."I have to talk about Harry, as well .,
He is just. .,
oh my .,
He is this eleven year old kid who lived with his mean aunt and uncle for his entire existence to discover that he is , actually, a wizard .,
So he goes to this school, finds out is famous and that his parents were killed for one of the best bad wizards out there .,
He doesn't know how to do magic, it's his first time making friends, in an entire new school in a total different environment, and still, he does good .,
Because he's kind, courageous, strong-minded, smart .,
He's an excellent friend, an excellent student .,
(unless when he's not sneaking around lol but still, he does it for the greater good) .,
Harry Potter is not only one of these books you love, it speaks to you .,
It makes you care about people who are not real, and still, you love them .,
You have all the dvds, all the books .,
You watched every movie in the movie theater as soon as they were released .,
It was a tradition, something you waited the whole year for .,
And no, you didn't cry like a baby in the last one .,
Not in Leville's speech, because how has he grown! .,
Not in Snape's scene, not when Harry "dies." And you definitely didn't cry when the movie ended .,
It's just. .,
it's a love for a series that will never die, you know?,
I loved every aspect of this .,
I loved how the movie was as faithful as possible, loved the authors playing these characters so well, loved how different and important each one of them is .,
Snape, Dumbledore, Hermione, Ron, Neville Longbottom, George and Fred, Harry, of course .,
I just can't wait to read the next one and be mesmerized all over again."After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure."  .,
It's impossible not to date myself through this review, but I first read Harry Potter when I was young enough to wish for a Hogwarts letter of my own .,
I'm now rereading the exact same hardcovers that I bought as they were released, mostly because my mother is a saint and mailed them all to me in San Francisco:I'm rereading this book while drinking a glass of wine (HA!!), and on this pass I really think it's the optimal children's book .,

It opens an entire world while still following a compact, interesting plot, and it makes me laugh on every single page .,
It's amazing that the Dumbledore who says, at the first feast, "Nitwit!,
Blubber!,
Oddment!,
Tweak!" can be the same person as the Dumbledore of the rest of the series, but somehow that is believable and wonderful .,
5/5 this book made me cry happy tears but maybe it was the alcohol  .,
Rather than write a review of this book, I will instead share memories I have about the series.*Making fun of my high school girlfriend for reading the books, borrowing this one from her, sitting in a chair in my parents' office and reading the first few pages, and apologizing for ever making fun of her .,

When you re-read a book and you get goosebumps from reading certain parts. .,
I will forever love this series which was a huge part of my childhood and early teenage years .,
I have forgotten how many times I have re-read these books by now, but I like finally being able to re-read it all in English .,
So different yet the same, and oh so wonderful .,

It's brilliant!,
I especially love the incredibly soulful sketch of Harry on page 238.Loved this, all of it - but no point in reviewing and remarking on what the world already knows .,

On to #2... .,
Obviously a re-read for me.Loved reading this book for the second time and having the illustrated version be the edition to experience it all again .,
Rowling is such a master storyteller .,
Not many writers have achieved creating such beloved characters .,
The illustrations were beautiful and that close to ending scene with Dumbledore is perfection .,
So much love and detail was put into these unique characters .,
Hagrid, I will always love you .,
Rereading this was a good choice!,
I think I'm going to reread this every year to be honest .,
My advice to anyone who hasn't read this?,
READ IT!,
As always, this story feels like coming home.A noteworthy development: This is the first time I've cried reading book one .,
I'm always prepared to cry while reading five and seven, but this was unexpected to say the least, especially given the countless number of times I've read this book .,
The Mirror of Erised scene just really hit me this time around .,
And I really appreciate Chris Columbus and Steve Kloves for making such a faithful film adaptation .,

This book remains pure magic.update: HAHA I just finished this only to have Doc pick it up .,
1/6/16He's only 8 pages in but he already hates the Dursleys more than he already did from watching the films (and lemme tell you, he despised them to begin with) .,
He especially detests Uncle Vernon .,
He also says he never got the vibe from the films of how utterly paranoid they are regarding magic and the Potters.1/13/16He still loves the zoo boa constrictor's "Thankssss, amigo."Also, "YER A WIZARD, HARRY."1/21/16He really gets a kick out of the way Hagrid speaks, he says it sounds like he's from Appalachia -- coming off reading Spencer's Mountain, it seems to be a good grounding point .,
And he picked up on Fantastic Beasts in the list of course books, and liked that I have the little copy of that one downstairs too :) Oh and he says he must not have paid much attention to the movie before, because the twin cores thing between Harry's and Voldy's wands really got his attention .,
Also, George's line: "We'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat!" to which I had to respond "George!,
-- Only joking, Mum." And then he just stared at me with the face of Who-even-are-you.I am LOVING this.3/1/16He finished it a few days ago (maybe it's been a week now?) and is on to book two .,
This edition has a sneak peek of the next book in the back, and he started reading that the other night before stopping and saying "Hang on, the second book's downstairs .,
Why am I reading this when I can just go get the book-" ROFL .,

Absolutely amazing!,
I don't know why it took me so long to start this series but I'm so glad I finally did .,
There are so many scenes in the book that were left out of the movie completely that I'm glad I got to experience by reading the book .,
I can't wait to jump into the second book of Potter's journey!,
June 2016 - Rereading my all time favorite series is the BEST .,
EVER .,
Even up to this day, it never lose its charm .,
My reading journey started on this series and it will always remained in my heart .,
I feel so nostalgic .,
If you haven't read this series, it's never too late .,

I really don't have any amount of words that I can string together to tell you how this book makes me feel .,
J.K. Rowling will always set the bar for how a series should be written, because Harry Potter is written with love, and it makes all the difference .,

Este libro me ha emocionado!ReseU+00F1a: http://elmarcapaginas-loco.blogspot.c. .,
I realize many people have said this and many people can express this way better than I can, but I'll try .,
I don't know how many times I've read the books so far in my life (I guess around the 5 times) but every time I start reading this series again I realize why this is my favourite series ever (and I'm 99.9% sure it will be never surpassed) .,
I have tried to explain this to others, but I never quite manage to tell why I love these books so much .,

And I don't know what the Nobel Prize comitee is thinking but if there is one person who changed the world by books it's J.K. Rowling .,
There are many other really, really good books, but if I try to compare them to Harry Potter it mostly goes sth like this:Books I like:1 .,
Harry Potter2 .,
The other books (Including Percy Jackson, Throne of Glass and The Mortal Instruments) (This is so hard :/ I can't do this)when reading 'normal' books, it often goes as follows:I read one hour, then I go on Goodreads/YouTube/I watch the news/whatever for some time (like an hour), I pick up the book again etc. when I'm reading Harry Potter things go more like this:I read for 3 hours, then I'm like oh I need to check the news, I watch the news for 5 minutes and I'm like but what am I actually doing?,
This is nonsense I'D RATHER BE READING And that makes that I can read 5 pretty big books in just one week and feel like I should have read more .,
And at the same time it makes me ache because I know I've only got two books left .,
AHHHHHHHHHH(time for another reread)  .,
There is no way I could EVER write a review for this book, so I'm just going to say a few words and leave it at that  .,
.,
Uploaded with ImageShack.usMy neverending thanks to Litchick for organizing this colossal group read .,
I can't believe it's been 15 years since I last touched these pages .,
"It was the best [re-read of my] life, better than winning at Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls  .,

"Happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light."Since 1997, the Harry Potter series has enchanted readers, both young and old .,

Legendary British author, J.K. Rowling's debut novel has gained international acclaim since its initial publication, winning a total of seven awards .,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the magic began .,
The novel begins at the small, quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey where the book's eleven year-old protagonist, Harry Potter, lives in the cupboard under the stairs .,
He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys: Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their son, Dudley .,
His only living relatives treat him poorly, making Harry's childhood miserable.Harry's unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain .,
As the novel unfolds, Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world, befriends other students, and comes face-to-face with adversity .,
The twists and turns, mounting suspense, and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life-changning and unforgettable.Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable, realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses .,
These characters, as some people would say, possess a certain amount of depth .,
Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels .,
Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero: courage, tenacity, and an inclination to protect others .,
Harry is willing to sacrifice everything, including his own life, to ensure the safety of others .,
Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves, whatever the cost.I must admit, Rowling's imagination is extraordinary .,
Her original vision of a young boy sporting a lighting scar who attended boarding school was transformed into a seven book series teeming with the unimaginable .,
Rowling's creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people, magical creatures, and thrilling enchantments .,
The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless .,
No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book.As the plot unfolded, readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series .,
Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook .,
These seemingly insignificant details, however, have a large impact upon later events within the book .,
My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired .,
The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second book.While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone falls under the "Fantasy" genre, Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel, especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome .,
First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrid's three-headed dog, Fluffy .,
The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology; according to legend, Cerberus, a three-headed dog, ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld .,
The only means of subduing Cerberus (and Fluffy, consequently) is the playing of a lyre .,
Additionally, the Hogwarts motto, "Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus," is Latin for "Never tickle a sleeping dragon." Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the series.I am most impressed not with the books themselves, but with the author whose rags-to-riches life story has inspired countless people worldwide .,
J.K. Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire, England .,
She was accepted at the University of Exeter, where she studied Classics .,
She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation, having suffered from multiple sclerosis .,
Several years later, Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter, Jessica .,
The unhappy couple separated 13 months after their marriage .,
Homeless, penniless, and caring for a newborn, Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide .,
We almost lost the brilliant, talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon .,
Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations .,
Despite her challenges, Rowling's perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to life.Overall, this series is the most memorable from my childhood .,
I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters, suspenseful plot, and flawless writing style .,
I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater, eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis .,
For Halloween last year, in fact, I dressed up in an old pair of robes, pulled on a wig, and drew a scar on my forehead .,
And to this day, I find myself reciting quotes from the series .,
I was crushed after the release of the final book, feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series .,
Looking back, I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series, committing it to memory .,
The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time; it has helped to shape the person I am today .,
There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,
Let's be honest here .,
If you're reading my reviews and haven't read this series, you're probably an adult, which means two things .,
One is that you have lived through this series releasing 7 novels, 8 movies, and becoming a cultural phenomenon .,
If you're here, you felt that societal pressure to read this, or one of your friends won't shut up until you do (probably) .,
There is little chance the hype can withstand reality .,
And that is partly because.There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,

you aren't eleven years old .,
This book is written for children .,
Yes, the books get darker and more mature (and much better) later on, but this one is for middle school aged kids.This is my first time rereading book 1 in at least 6 years .,
This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book .,
The main characters are dumb, the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment, and in order for some events to make any sense, one has to create their own head-canon .,
Typically at such points, I stop, remind myself that this is a children's book, and get a glass of Maker's 46.But forgive them I do .,
Rowling creates a fantastic world, characters, and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it .,
If I were reading this for the first time today, I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me .,
But I do know that having read the rest of the series, it didn't even cross my mind not to finish this reread, despite seeing all of the problems .,
The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry, so while we never get adult novels, we do get much "better" writing in later books .,
If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off, I encourage you to keep going for another couple of books.As a final note, my rating for this book is for the series .,
I can't honestly rate this book by itself at this point .,
I first picked up The Philosopher's Stone about seven years ago .,
I'd gone from reading true crime and biographies, to having just finished the Twilight saga, when the Harry Potter series was recommended to me .,
From memory I think I read the first two chapters and then put it down .,
It felt really young and I felt it just wasn't for me .,
So I moved on .,
After starting my IG account I was constantly bombarded with people telling me how amazing the series was and how I had to read it .,

And it just goes to show that even if a book is not meant for you when you first pick it up, it doesn't mean that at another time it won't be something that you love .,
Because this book. .,
This book was brilliant!,
It was enchanting and captivating and magical .,
I was completely engrossed from the very first page .,
I absolutely adored the friendship between Harry and Ron, and the dynamic was completed once Hermione was accepted into the little group .,
And Hermione, boy she was awesome!,
She had me grinning from ear to ear .,
I'm so intrigued by Snape, and I can't wait to peel back all his layers to see what he has hidden .,
And then there's the gentle giant that is Hagrid .,
My heart is so full of love for him .,
My favourite character so far!,
I can't tell you how incredibly happy I am to have given this series a second chance .,
I can now officially say I'm well on my way to being a Potterhead!,
Because everyone on the planet excluding me and maybe some of the Kardashians have read this series, I'll skip the plot summary and go for a less formal review .,
I can see why so many people adore Harry Potter .,

Each of the characters has a distinct personality, and Rowling's simple writing style leaves room for brevity and enough imagery to pull you into the setting .,
Story-wise, she includes all of the necessary s: foreshadowing, conflicts that escalate to the climax, a pretty satisfying plot twist, etc.I'll probably read one other book in between each installment of this series .,
I'm looking forward to seeing the characters mature and the plot become darker as many others have said it will!,
Rereading this magical book with these beautiful illustrations was such a new experience .,
Generally I had so much fun rereading this because I discovered so many little details I hadn't noticed the first time .,
But this new excitement of a page turner was amazing .,
I was so excited to see if there was going to be an illustration on the next page and how it would look like .,
Highly recommend .,

So I've watched almost all the movies and then at a certain point I stopped and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch the last three movies, not until I would have read the series. .,
Well after 14 years I've finally had the courage to start this Saga and I'm so ashamed that I've waited so long. .,
This book is adorable, perfect, I loved it!!!,
And I've already started the second one!!!,
Have to make up for all the years I've lost!,
D: But I've chosen to read it in my language, italian ;). .,

-----Dopo quattordici anni sono finalmente riuscita a trovare il "coraggio" per iniziare questa saga .,
Eh si, coraggio .,
Dopo il trauma subito da piccola avevo paura di riprendere questo testo .,
Ogni volta che pensavo alla saga di Harry Potter mi rivedevo piccola, seduta accanto alla mia professoressa d'inglese che mi invitava a leggere e cerchiare tutte le parole che non comprendevo (che erano tantissime, considerando che ero appena uscita da ESL - classe per alunni stranieri nelle scuole americane - da pochissimo) .,
E quindi successivamente non ho mai piU+00F9 voluto saperne di HARRY POTTER!,
Dannazione!!!!,
. .,
quanto mi pento di non aver trovato il coraggio prima. .,
per fortuna Harry Potter U+00E8 in grado di stupire non solo i bambini!!!,
Dopo un paio di mesi dalla lettura del testo la scuola ci portU+00F2 a vedere il nuovo film di Harry Potter al cinema, ma che dire. .,
il film mi rapU+00EC completamente .,
Non vi era nessuno che mi osservava, solo io ed Harry .,
Ed iniziai a vedere anche i film successivi .,
Ma poi dopo il quarto mi imposi di fermarmi .,
Dovevo leggere la Saga di Harry Potter!,
. .,
beh dopo tanti anni eccomi qui!!!,
Harry forgive me!!!,
But I'm all yours now. .,
ready to fly to Hogwarts with you!Questo libro U+00E8 dolcissimo!!!,
Harry, Ron, Hermione. .,
ohhh can't wait to see how the love between the two grows!!!,
che non stanca mai, che ti tiene incollata alle pagine!,
Un testo davvero unico, con protagonisti straordinari. .,
e sto solo all'inizio!,
Non vedo l'ora di continuare. .,
beh in realtU+00E0 giU+00E0 sto leggendo il secondo!,
Misteri, magia, amici, nemici, incanti, scope volanti, pozioni, intrighi, lotte,, tanti ingredienti squisiti che non possono non suscitare una forte emozione .,
Amore .,
STUPENDO!!!I need more!!!!Ok, so this was my first time reading this book (don't judge me) .,
While I wasn't quite as enamored with it as the thousands of adoring fans (the ones who have read them over and over and over) have been, this wasn't a bad read .,
I did have to keep reminding myself that this was a children's book, and I'm WAY past the target age!,
My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,

My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,
I'm actually looking forward to reading the rest of the books, just to see how the books, and the characters, grow up .,
I haven't seen the movies, but I don't live under a rock either, and I know that each book progressively ages with the characters, turning from children's books with child-like problems, to books with adult issues and adult responses from the characters .,
I'm really hoping that things in the next books aren't so easy for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to solve .,
That's probably my biggest complaint, and why it "only" got four stars from me: everything was too easy, that the mysteries were laid out too simply and were easily solved .,
They were clever, and again, I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't written with me in mind.This first book was entertaining, as I've said, but it wasn't a five-star read (I'm going to be in trouble for that statement, I think!) .,
It reminded me of a mash-up between the old Hardy Boysancy Drew books (kids solving crimes with skills well beyond their age or abilities) and Scooby-Doo .,
Yes, Scooby-Doo!,
Especially at the end when the real bad guy was revealed (it wasn't who they thought it was), and the bad guy's reaction was, "Darn you, meddling kids!" (or something very similar) .,
:DOn to the next book!I started reading this for the Nth time 3 days before the death of Alan Rickman, who played Snape in the adaptations- in my opinion the best thing about them .,
It was sad, heartbreaking really, to think of his character just beginning his journey again for me through this reading, while the man who played him so excellently had just passed away .,
I love the adventure and magic of these books, but I especially love the journey we take with Snape's character .,
He is everything .,

[re-read August 2015] I won't write a full review, since pretty much everyone knows how this book goes!,
I'm just amazed by the amount of foreshadowing!,
JK Rowling must have exactly known how the story would evolve .,
I don't mind that this book is short, when I think of OOTP for example, I find the beginning (before they go to Hogwarts) too long and often boring. .,

Yeah, there were problems .,
But I'm not organized, I don't wanna die, and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff.I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire .,
(So it wasn't the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was -then- Elijah Wood before he was uglier.) What made me want to read them?,
The Dursleys .,
I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious (they are hilarious .,

No, not the mythology references .,
Yaaay she read Shakespeare .,
My Uncle Remus did too .,
Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series (I do love that) .,
I loved the Aberforth goat stuff .,
I loved the names of Lockhart's books (Gadding with Ghouls, Year with the Yeti, etc.) and the little humor stuff she slips in .,
I can still quote asshole-y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with (Potter stinks!) and can't remember the basic plot twists .,
I was a card carrying Potterite (laminated!) .,

I do miss wondering what was going to happen next .,

I'm jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind .,
Yeah, I've got my own stories .,
But I don't think I have as much fun with mine (probably because I'm not a sadistic murderer like she is) .,
I liked the books better before they grew up .,
Rowling couldn't write a love story for anything .,
I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry .,
My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together .,
I love the togetherness .,
(Aberforth was eventually important in the last book .,
That almost ruined it.)P.s .,
In case I didn't look dorky enough. .,
I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans .,
They were all like: "Americans are so dumb that you don't understand what Philosopher means." I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions, JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place (it doesn't mean Just Kidding .,
The publishers thought boys wouldn't read a female author), and their effing ugly covers (English kids lose so often .,
No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken's books!) .,
I did know that jumper meant sweater .,
It's not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle.I found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,
When they were released there were not a lot of children's books that were set in the world of magic .,
I think for me the greatest thing about this book is, it teaches children and adults alike that, you can achieve anything you wish even when you think that it is impossible .,
I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughoutI found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,

I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughout the book, she is more of a straight-laced student but she befriends Ron and Harry .,
She tells them it is to keep them out of trouble, but I believe deep down she is actually happy that she has found people that like a bit of adventure, it is something new to her .,
One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is, why Harry was left with the Dursley's after the death of his parents .,
Although it is clear that Harry is not treated very well at all, I think this was the best place for Harry to grow up .,
Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability, they teach Harry a very valuable lesson..kindness, when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts, he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursley's .,
They also have taught him how to stand up for himself when he is taunted by Draco Malfoy.Rowling has the ability to create a world that every reader of these books wishes to enter and never leave .,
With owls that deliver the mail, a magical school where anything is possible and lets not forget the moving pictures, Hogwarts is a place that will live in the hearts of fans for years to come .,
All and all a great start to what looks like a fantastic series .,
If you are a fan of all things magical and have not delved into the world of Harry Potter yet, I would highly recommend you give this series a chance.I'm a huge fantasy reader , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story bI'm a huge fantasy reader U+26AF U+035B , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story begins with Harry living with his uncle Dursley after Hogwarts send thousands of messages for Harry, Hagrid finally comes to take Harry with him to Hogwarts and Harry got to know about how he's parents really died and they're stories oh and he got to know he's a wizard too!,

Like the centaurs talking about the innocent being the first to die?,
And just so many things just mentioned that come up later, the dragon in Gringotts, Dittany, Sirius Black, Etc.There's also a lot of things I've forgotten weren't in the movie, which is crazy!,
But so good .,
I love it just as much IF NOT EVEN MORE.This is such a wonderful read!!,
I always love rereading Harry Potter but with the illustrations it just added so much to the story that you get new surprises through the images while reading!,
This is just fantastic!,
Finally I would be doing a review of the book that made me plunge into the wonderland of texts.Catch you soon on this space .,

Having suffered through so many years of school required reading, I couldnU+2019t look at a book without thinking of essays!,
Not to mention my distaste for writing at the time .,
All that changed however, with one book that was so magnificent, it must have been a gift from God!,
It completely altered my view of books .,
What was this holy novel, you might be asking?,
U+2026It wasnU+2019t Harry Potter .,
It was The Hunger Games .,
As my eyes were opened to the Young Adult genre, my love of reading began .,
Shortly after reading The Hunger Games, I made a deal with my friend, who passionately loved the Harry Potter books and had been trying to get me to read them for quite some time .,
If she read the first Hunger Games book, IU+2019d read the first Harry Potter book .,
Flash forward a few months, and wouldnU+2019t you know it, my friend read the whole trilogy!,
Did I breeze through all seven Harry Potter books in a week?,
HAHAHAHAHA, NO.You want to know the best part?,
That was 3 years agoU+2026I had been hearing about Harry Potter since I knew how to read, but really disliked the concept of it .,
It's just about some stupid boy who goes to a school for wizards!,
Also, I've heard it rips off Lord of the Rings, so I'm going to stay as far away from it as possible..See, the funny thing about this is, I actually knew nothing about Harry Potter .,
Nothing .,
Zip .,
Nada .,
I hadn't even seen more than 5 minutes of the movies!,
*gasps* After having a hundred or so people threatening me to read it, out of fear for my life, I complied .,
I certainly am glad I did .,
It was incredible!,
Absolutely stupendous!,
The Characters "So light a fire!" Harry choked .,
"Yes..of course..but there's no wood!""HAVE YOU GONE MAD!" Ron bellowed .,
"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT!,
Harry.Undoubtedly, my favorite part of this beautiful book was its beautiful characters .,
Harry, Hermione, Ron, Fred, George..I love them all!,
Ironically, Harry was my least favorite of the trio .,
Not that I didn't like him, but he just didn't have as distinct of a personality as Hermione and Ron .,
However, I still admired his loyalty and selflessness .,
I'm really excited to see how his character develops throughout the series.Hermione.Is it bad if I see a lot of myself in Hermione?,
Haha .,
I can be the occasional smart-alec who gets all up in your business..so, naturally, I love Hermione Granger .,
She wasn't a Mary Sue!,
She was intelligent, loyal, and feisty!,
There really should be more heroines like her .,
I also have brown hair, brown eyes, and am Muggle-born..We're practically the same person.Ron.He was pretty great too .,
Having four siblings (two of which, are twins), I can relate to him .,
Ron and Hermione's bickering was positively priceless, and he had more than a few memorable remarks .,
He was the comedy relief of the whole book, and it wouldn't be the same without him.Malfoy .,
I was really hoping this little git would get devoured by Fluffy.Other characters .,
Hagrid, was hilarious, and is it strange if I am particularly fond of Hedwig?,
Dumbledore didn't really have that much screen time, so I don't really know what to think of him..yet .,
My favorite, or should I say favorites, are definitely Gred and Froge .,
*wink* I swear, I was cracking up over every dialogue they had .,
As a matter of fact, I loved all the Weasleys .,
U+201CNow, you two U+2013 this year, you behave yourselves .,
If I get one more owl telling me you've U+2013 you've blown up a toilet or U+2013""Blown up a toilet?,
We've never blown up a toilet.""Great idea though, thanks, Mum.U+201D The World Building I finally see why everyone admires J.K. Rowling .,
Hogwarts and the wizard world she creates is whimsically ingenious .,
Honestly, why can't Quidditch be a real sport?,
It's fantastic!,
I want to ride a broom stick and hit flying balls into peoples' faces!,
All flavor jelly beans?,
How awesome is that?,
Apparently, you can buy them from Amazon..including earwax flavor (Eww, wasn't licorice bad enough?) .,
I'm not kidding, look it up!,
Rowling did a marvelous job of luring me into Potter's world .,
The only aspect of the universe that puzzles me, is where exactly is Hogwarts?,
Is it in a different universe from our reality?,
If so, how are Harry and Ron (I started a wee bit on Chamber of Secrets..as soon as I finished this one) able to fly a car there?!,
What I Loved U+269C The protagonist and side characters .,
Lovely, lovely, lovely characters .,
Rowling did a spectacular job of creating such a hilarious and realistic cast.U+269C The plot was highly entertaining .,
Though a little short, Harry and his friends' adventure was incredibly entertaining and I am especially curious about what other secrets Hogwarts holds..U+269C Rowling's writing was pleasant and engaging .,
A little simple, yes, but short and sweet .,
What else should I expect from a Middle Grade novel?U+269C The plot twist in the end .,
I'm not going to lie, I felt quite childish that I didn't see it coming .,
It was so obvious, yet I was too busy laughing over Harry swallowing Quidditch balls to notice what was right in front of me.U+269C The villains .,
*claps* Well done, Rowling .,
Well done .,
What I Didn't Love U+269C The pacing .,
A short novel?,
Understandable .,
An abrupt ending?,
Inexcusable .,
Final Thoughts I hope all you Muggles are happy now!,
I finally did it!Harry Potter was so wonderful!,
I really should've read it all those years ago .,
The characters were exceptional, story incredible, writing amiable..honestly, what else can I say, other than it truly was a magical book .,
I'll absolutely be finishing this series .,
:)WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .,
THIS IS EPIC .,
FUCKING EPIC .,
_____________________________________________________________Guys my little sister just came put to me with this book in her hand and asked if I wanted to BR with her .,
She looked so happy when I said yes .,
It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,
I'd heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon, but still I didn't feel compelled to read the books .,
I've been reader all my life but I don't know, I was kinda undecided about it .,
Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watchingIt was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,

Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watching the films, so what may I am losing about the story (oh boy!,
how wrong I was!) .,
I had some good surprises because I wasn't reading the books like in the third movie .,
When I watched the fourth film, Goblet of Fire, I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book BUT it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books .,
Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish, he had an edition on English of the first book, this one, and since by then I already was reading on English, he lent me the book .,
Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books .,
I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that it's not mine, still I don't want to have books, etc. .,
that are not mine under my care .,
Still, my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish .,
Since I wasn't SO convinced to read the books, I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book .,
I started to reading it. .,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Right in the first pages, when Hagrid mentioned WHO lent him out the flying motorcycle!!!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Keep on mind that I already watched 4 films by then, so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle, mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Then, I knew that J.K. Rowling was a wicked genius!!!,
And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book, since certain character that appears in the first book, then I said "Oh, boy, what a boring chapter, why did J.K. bothered to create such unimportant character?" and I was starting to read the fifth book and. .,
"Mmh. .,
where I heard about this character before..where?..mmmh..OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
NO!!!,
IT CAN'T BE!!!" .,
By then, I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW!,
Yes, it was the same character!!!,
Right in the first book!!!,
So, re-confirmed like for the umpteenth time. .,
J.K. Rowling is a wicked genius!!!,
I enjoyed a lot reading the first book .,
J.K. Rowling has a very interesting style of writing .,
Also, the first book is very good combining the magical world with the normal things that people has to do when kids are beginning school .,
Going to buy the school supplies .,
Having to deal different kind of teachers .,
Some good, some strict, some both .,
The forming of friendships with schoolmates .,
Indeed a wonderful and magical book .,
Highly recommended.I absolutely adore this new edition of Harry Potter and I hope that they will make illustrated versions of all of the books (although they might get quite big..) Getting to experience this story once again, after not having read the book for a long time and this time with beautiful illustrations to complement the story was a truly magnificent experience .,
J.K. Rowling is the queen!!Harry Potter is and will always be one of my all time favorite series First book down for readalong!,
Doesn't matter how many times I read these books, they're always just as amazing as the first time around!,
So amazing!,
NOW WHERE IS MY LETTER FOR HOGWARTS?!,
I WANT IT!!!,
After two years of ESL my english teacher decided to assign me a book to read, and every day for a couple of hours she would stay with me and I'd have to read, circle all the words I didn't know and so much more. .,
the book assigned was Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .,
After reading that book I started hating Harry Potter so much that I didn't want to see another book of his. .,

So I've watched almost all the movies and then at a certain point I stopped and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch the last three movies, not until I would have read the series. .,
Well after 14 years I've finally had the courage to start this Saga and I'm so ashamed that I've waited so long. .,
This book is adorable, perfect, I loved it!!!,
And I've already started the second one!!!,
Have to make up for all the years I've lost!,
D: But I've chosen to read it in my language, italian ;). .,
It's funny how a bad memory can influence you .,
Stupid Me!!!,
I almost risked never reading this wonderful saga.. .,

HARRY POTTER Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen and who the bad guy was, I was still surprised!,
Rowling has a way of capturing you completely!,
She has bewitched me completely!!!!!!Me after reading Harry Potter!,
-----Dopo quattordici anni sono finalmente riuscita a trovare il "coraggio" per iniziare questa saga .,
Eh si, coraggio .,
Dopo il trauma subito da piccola avevo paura di riprendere questo testo .,
Ogni volta che pensavo alla saga di Harry Potter mi rivedevo piccola, seduta accanto alla mia professoressa d'inglese che mi invitava a leggere e cerchiare tutte le parole che non comprendevo (che erano tantissime, considerando che ero appena uscita da ESL - classe per alunni stranieri nelle scuole americane - da pochissimo) .,
E quindi successivamente non ho mai piU+00F9 voluto saperne di HARRY POTTER!,
Dannazione!!!!,
. .,
quanto mi pento di non aver trovato il coraggio prima. .,
per fortuna Harry Potter U+00E8 in grado di stupire non solo i bambini!!!,
Dopo un paio di mesi dalla lettura del testo la scuola ci portU+00F2 a vedere il nuovo film di Harry Potter al cinema, ma che dire. .,
il film mi rapU+00EC completamente .,
Non vi era nessuno che mi osservava, solo io ed Harry .,
Ed iniziai a vedere anche i film successivi .,
Ma poi dopo il quarto mi imposi di fermarmi .,
Dovevo leggere la Saga di Harry Potter!,
. .,
beh dopo tanti anni eccomi qui!!!,
Harry forgive me!!!,
But I'm all yours now. .,

Un testo davvero unico, con protagonisti straordinari. .,
e sto solo all'inizio!,
Non vedo l'ora di continuare. .,
beh in realtU+00E0 giU+00E0 sto leggendo il secondo!,
Misteri, magia, amici, nemici, incanti, scope volanti, pozioni, intrighi, lotte,, tanti ingredienti squisiti che non possono non suscitare una forte emozione .,
Amore .,
STUPENDO!!!I need more!!!!,
Ok, so this was my first time reading this book (don't judge me) .,
While I wasn't quite as enamored with it as the thousands of adoring fans (the ones who have read them over and over and over) have been, this wasn't a bad read .,
I did have to keep reminding myself that this was a children's book, and I'm WAY past the target age!,
My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,

I'm actually looking forward to reading the rest of the books, just to see how the books, and the characters, grow up .,
I haven't seen the movies, but I don't live under a rock either, and I know that each book progressively ages with the characters, turning from children's books with child-like problems, to books with adult issues and adult responses from the characters .,
I'm really hoping that things in the next books aren't so easy for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to solve .,
That's probably my biggest complaint, and why it "only" got four stars from me: everything was too easy, that the mysteries were laid out too simply and were easily solved .,
They were clever, and again, I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't written with me in mind.This first book was entertaining, as I've said, but it wasn't a five-star read (I'm going to be in trouble for that statement, I think!) .,
It reminded me of a mash-up between the old Hardy Boysancy Drew books (kids solving crimes with skills well beyond their age or abilities) and Scooby-Doo .,
Yes, Scooby-Doo!,
Especially at the end when the real bad guy was revealed (it wasn't who they thought it was), and the bad guy's reaction was, "Darn you, meddling kids!" (or something very similar) .,
:DOn to the next book!,
I started reading this for the Nth time 3 days before the death of Alan Rickman, who played Snape in the adaptations- in my opinion the best thing about them .,
It was sad, heartbreaking really, to think of his character just beginning his journey again for me through this reading, while the man who played him so excellently had just passed away .,
I love the adventure and magic of these books, but I especially love the journey we take with Snape's character .,
He is everything .,

[re-read August 2015] I won't write a full review, since pretty much everyone knows how this book goes!,
I'm just amazed by the amount of foreshadowing!,
JK Rowling must have exactly known how the story would evolve .,
I don't mind that this book is short, when I think of OOTP for example, I find the beginning (before they go to Hogwarts) too long and often boring. .,

But I'm not organized, I don't wanna die, and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff.I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire .,
(So it wasn't the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was -then- Elijah Wood before he was uglier.) What made me want to read them?,
The Dursleys .,
I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious (they are hilarious .,
I love it when Vernon tells everyone that Harry attends "St .,
Brutus' Center for Incurably Criminal Boys" .,
His Japanese golfer joke .,
When playing trivia games with friends I'd piss myself with excitement if I got a muggle question .,
"Vernon's drill company is called Grunnings!,
Yes!,
I'm more amazing than all of you put together!" Wonder why no one plays reindeer games with me anymore..) I love muggles.I loved the stupid shit .,
No, not the mythology references .,
Yaaay she read Shakespeare .,
My Uncle Remus did too .,
Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series (I do love that) .,
I loved the Aberforth goat stuff .,
I loved the names of Lockhart's books (Gadding with Ghouls, Year with the Yeti, etc.) and the little humor stuff she slips in .,
I can still quote asshole-y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with (Potter stinks!) and can't remember the basic plot twists .,
I was a card carrying Potterite (laminated!) .,
Sigh .,
I do miss wondering what was going to happen next .,
I miss having that place to retreat to in my mind .,
I'd go on my favorite Harry forum and have fun making up theories (I was right about EVERYYTHING *coughs*) .,
I'm jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind .,
Yeah, I've got my own stories .,
But I don't think I have as much fun with mine (probably because I'm not a sadistic murderer like she is) .,
I liked the books better before they grew up .,
Rowling couldn't write a love story for anything .,
I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry .,
My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together .,
I love the togetherness .,
(Aberforth was eventually important in the last book .,
That almost ruined it.)P.s .,
In case I didn't look dorky enough. .,
I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans .,
They were all like: "Americans are so dumb that you don't understand what Philosopher means." I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions, JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place (it doesn't mean Just Kidding .,
The publishers thought boys wouldn't read a female author), and their effing ugly covers (English kids lose so often .,
No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken's books!) .,
I did know that jumper meant sweater .,
It's not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle .,
I found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,
When they were released there were not a lot of children's books that were set in the world of magic .,
I think for me the greatest thing about this book is, it teaches children and adults alike that, you can achieve anything you wish even when you think that it is impossible .,
I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughoutI found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,

I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughout the book, she is more of a straight-laced student but she befriends Ron and Harry .,
She tells them it is to keep them out of trouble, but I believe deep down she is actually happy that she has found people that like a bit of adventure, it is something new to her .,
One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is, why Harry was left with the Dursley's after the death of his parents .,
Although it is clear that Harry is not treated very well at all, I think this was the best place for Harry to grow up .,
Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability, they teach Harry a very valuable lesson..kindness, when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts, he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursley's .,
They also have taught him how to stand up for himself when he is taunted by Draco Malfoy.Rowling has the ability to create a world that every reader of these books wishes to enter and never leave .,
With owls that deliver the mail, a magical school where anything is possible and lets not forget the moving pictures, Hogwarts is a place that will live in the hearts of fans for years to come .,
All and all a great start to what looks like a fantastic series .,
If you are a fan of all things magical and have not delved into the world of Harry Potter yet, I would highly recommend you give this series a chance .,
I'm a huge fantasy reader , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story bI'm a huge fantasy reader U+26AF U+035B , I remember the first time when I got this book I was 9,growing up on this series until today I still get excited like the first time I did read it,this shows how amazing is J.K Rowling writing is, she's just takes us to a world we never been to."There is not good and evil, there is only power and those too weak to seek it."There once was a boy named Harry,who constantly conquered death.But in one final duel between good and badhe may take his final breath.The story begins with Harry living with his uncle Dursley after Hogwarts send thousands of messages for Harry, Hagrid finally comes to take Harry with him to Hogwarts and Harry got to know about how he's parents really died and they're stories oh and he got to know he's a wizard too!,

I LOVE Harry Potter, fantastic start to the series.Reread December 2014 for #HarryXmasToYouThere are SO MANY foreshadowing things I never noticed before!,
Like the centaurs talking about the innocent being the first to die?,
And just so many things just mentioned that come up later, the dragon in Gringotts, Dittany, Sirius Black, Etc.There's also a lot of things I've forgotten weren't in the movie, which is crazy!,
But so good .,
I love it just as much IF NOT EVEN MORE .,
This is such a wonderful read!!,
I always love rereading Harry Potter but with the illustrations it just added so much to the story that you get new surprises through the images while reading!,
This is just fantastic!,
Finally I would be doing a review of the book that made me plunge into the wonderland of texts.Catch you soon on this space .,

But we're not stupid-we know we're called Gred and Forge.U+201D Originally posted on Stellar Scrutiny Book Blog.Well, it turns out all those Muggles were rightU+2026 I didnU+2019t enjoy reading until a few years ago .,
Having suffered through so many years of school required reading, I couldnU+2019t look at a book without thinking of essays!,
Not to mention my distaste for writing at the time .,
All that changed ho U+201CYou haven't got a letter on yours," George observed .,

Having suffered through so many years of school required reading, I couldnU+2019t look at a book without thinking of essays!,
Not to mention my distaste for writing at the time .,
All that changed however, with one book that was so magnificent, it must have been a gift from God!,
It completely altered my view of books .,
What was this holy novel, you might be asking?,
U+2026It wasnU+2019t Harry Potter .,
It was The Hunger Games .,
As my eyes were opened to the Young Adult genre, my love of reading began .,
Shortly after reading The Hunger Games, I made a deal with my friend, who passionately loved the Harry Potter books and had been trying to get me to read them for quite some time .,
If she read the first Hunger Games book, IU+2019d read the first Harry Potter book .,
Flash forward a few months, and wouldnU+2019t you know it, my friend read the whole trilogy!,
Did I breeze through all seven Harry Potter books in a week?,
HAHAHAHAHA, NO.You want to know the best part?,
That was 3 years agoU+2026I had been hearing about Harry Potter since I knew how to read, but really disliked the concept of it .,
It's just about some stupid boy who goes to a school for wizards!,
Also, I've heard it rips off Lord of the Rings, so I'm going to stay as far away from it as possible..See, the funny thing about this is, I actually knew nothing about Harry Potter .,
Nothing .,
Zip .,
Nada .,
I hadn't even seen more than 5 minutes of the movies!,
*gasps* After having a hundred or so people threatening me to read it, out of fear for my life, I complied .,
I certainly am glad I did .,
It was incredible!,
Absolutely stupendous!,
The Characters "So light a fire!" Harry choked .,
"Yes..of course..but there's no wood!""HAVE YOU GONE MAD!" Ron bellowed .,
"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT!,
Harry.Undoubtedly, my favorite part of this beautiful book was its beautiful characters .,
Harry, Hermione, Ron, Fred, George..I love them all!,
Ironically, Harry was my least favorite of the trio .,
Not that I didn't like him, but he just didn't have as distinct of a personality as Hermione and Ron .,
However, I still admired his loyalty and selflessness .,
I'm really excited to see how his character develops throughout the series.Hermione.Is it bad if I see a lot of myself in Hermione?,
Haha .,
I can be the occasional smart-alec who gets all up in your business..so, naturally, I love Hermione Granger .,
She wasn't a Mary Sue!,
She was intelligent, loyal, and feisty!,
There really should be more heroines like her .,
I also have brown hair, brown eyes, and am Muggle-born..We're practically the same person.Ron.He was pretty great too .,
Having four siblings (two of which, are twins), I can relate to him .,
Ron and Hermione's bickering was positively priceless, and he had more than a few memorable remarks .,
He was the comedy relief of the whole book, and it wouldn't be the same without him.Malfoy .,
I was really hoping this little git would get devoured by Fluffy.Other characters .,
Hagrid, was hilarious, and is it strange if I am particularly fond of Hedwig?,
Dumbledore didn't really have that much screen time, so I don't really know what to think of him..yet .,
My favorite, or should I say favorites, are definitely Gred and Froge .,
*wink* I swear, I was cracking up over every dialogue they had .,
As a matter of fact, I loved all the Weasleys .,
U+201CNow, you two U+2013 this year, you behave yourselves .,
If I get one more owl telling me you've U+2013 you've blown up a toilet or U+2013""Blown up a toilet?,
We've never blown up a toilet.""Great idea though, thanks, Mum.U+201D The World Building I finally see why everyone admires J.K. Rowling .,
Hogwarts and the wizard world she creates is whimsically ingenious .,
Honestly, why can't Quidditch be a real sport?,
It's fantastic!,
I want to ride a broom stick and hit flying balls into peoples' faces!,
All flavor jelly beans?,
How awesome is that?,
Apparently, you can buy them from Amazon..including earwax flavor (Eww, wasn't licorice bad enough?) .,
I'm not kidding, look it up!,
Rowling did a marvelous job of luring me into Potter's world .,
The only aspect of the universe that puzzles me, is where exactly is Hogwarts?,
Is it in a different universe from our reality?,
If so, how are Harry and Ron (I started a wee bit on Chamber of Secrets..as soon as I finished this one) able to fly a car there?!,
What I Loved U+269C The protagonist and side characters .,
Lovely, lovely, lovely characters .,
Rowling did a spectacular job of creating such a hilarious and realistic cast.U+269C The plot was highly entertaining .,
Though a little short, Harry and his friends' adventure was incredibly entertaining and I am especially curious about what other secrets Hogwarts holds..U+269C Rowling's writing was pleasant and engaging .,
A little simple, yes, but short and sweet .,
What else should I expect from a Middle Grade novel?U+269C The plot twist in the end .,
I'm not going to lie, I felt quite childish that I didn't see it coming .,
It was so obvious, yet I was too busy laughing over Harry swallowing Quidditch balls to notice what was right in front of me.U+269C The villains .,
*claps* Well done, Rowling .,
Well done .,
What I Didn't Love U+269C The pacing .,
A short novel?,
Understandable .,
An abrupt ending?,
Inexcusable .,
Final Thoughts I hope all you Muggles are happy now!,
I finally did it!Harry Potter was so wonderful!,
I really should've read it all those years ago .,
The characters were exceptional, story incredible, writing amiable..honestly, what else can I say, other than it truly was a magical book .,
I'll absolutely be finishing this series .,
:)  .,
WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .,
THIS IS EPIC .,
FUCKING EPIC .,
_____________________________________________________________Guys my little sister just came put to me with this book in her hand and asked if I wanted to BR with her .,
She looked so happy when I said yes .,
It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,
I'd heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon, but still I didn't feel compelled to read the books .,
I've been reader all my life but I don't know, I was kinda undecided about it .,
Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watchingIt was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,

Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watching the films, so what may I am losing about the story (oh boy!,
how wrong I was!) .,
I had some good surprises because I wasn't reading the books like in the third movie .,
When I watched the fourth film, Goblet of Fire, I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book BUT it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books .,
Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish, he had an edition on English of the first book, this one, and since by then I already was reading on English, he lent me the book .,
Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books .,
I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that it's not mine, still I don't want to have books, etc. .,
that are not mine under my care .,
Still, my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish .,
Since I wasn't SO convinced to read the books, I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book .,
I started to reading it. .,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Right in the first pages, when Hagrid mentioned WHO lent him out the flying motorcycle!!!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Keep on mind that I already watched 4 films by then, so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle, mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Then, I knew that J.K. Rowling was a wicked genius!!!,
And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book, since certain character that appears in the first book, then I said "Oh, boy, what a boring chapter, why did J.K. bothered to create such unimportant character?" and I was starting to read the fifth book and. .,
"Mmh. .,
where I heard about this character before..where?..mmmh..OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
NO!!!,
IT CAN'T BE!!!" .,
By then, I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW!,
Yes, it was the same character!!!,
Right in the first book!!!,
So, re-confirmed like for the umpteenth time. .,
J.K. Rowling is a wicked genius!!!,
I enjoyed a lot reading the first book .,
J.K. Rowling has a very interesting style of writing .,
Also, the first book is very good combining the magical world with the normal things that people has to do when kids are beginning school .,
Going to buy the school supplies .,
Having to deal different kind of teachers .,
Some good, some strict, some both .,
The forming of friendships with schoolmates .,
Indeed a wonderful and magical book .,
Highly recommended .,
I absolutely adore this new edition of Harry Potter and I hope that they will make illustrated versions of all of the books (although they might get quite big..) Getting to experience this story once again, after not having read the book for a long time and this time with beautiful illustrations to complement the story was a truly magnificent experience .,
J.K. Rowling is the queen!!Harry Potter is and will always be one of my all time favorite series  .,
First book down for readalong!,
Doesn't matter how many times I read these books, they're always just as amazing as the first time around!,
So amazing!,
I realize many people have said this and many people can express this way better than I can, but I'll try .,
I don't know how many times I've read the books so far in my life (I guess around the 5 times) but every time I start reading this series again I realize why this is my favourite series ever (and I'm 99.9% sure it will be never surpassed) .,
I have tried to explain this to others, but I never quite manage to tell why I love these books so much .,
And I don't know what the Nobel Prize comitee isI realize many people have said this and many people can express this way better than I can, but I'll try .,

I have tried to explain this to others, but I never quite manage to tell why I love these books so much .,
And I don't know what the Nobel Prize comitee is thinking but if there is one person who changed the world by books it's J.K. Rowling .,
There are many other really, really good books, but if I try to compare them to Harry Potter it mostly goes sth like this:Books I like:1 .,
Harry Potter2 .,
The other books (Including Percy Jackson, Throne of Glass and The Mortal Instruments) (This is so hard :/ I can't do this)when reading 'normal' books, it often goes as follows:I read one hour, then I go on Goodreads/YouTube/I watch the news/whatever for some time (like an hour), I pick up the book again etc. when I'm reading Harry Potter things go more like this:I read for 3 hours, then I'm like oh I need to check the news, I watch the news for 5 minutes and I'm like but what am I actually doing?,
This is nonsense I'D RATHER BE READING And that makes that I can read 5 pretty big books in just one week and feel like I should have read more .,
And at the same time it makes me ache because I know I've only got two books left .,
AHHHHHHHHHH(time for another reread)  .,
There is no way I could EVER write a review for this book, so I'm just going to say a few words and leave it at that  .,
.,
Uploaded with ImageShack.usMy neverending thanks to Litchick for organizing this colossal group read .,
I can't believe it's been 15 years since I last touched these pages .,

"Happiness can be found in the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light."Since 1997, the Harry Potter series has enchanted readers, both young and old .,

Legendary British author, J.K. Rowling's debut novel has gained international acclaim since its initial publication, winning a total of seven awards .,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the thrilling first installment of the series where all of the magic began .,
The novel begins at the small, quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey where the book's eleven year-old protagonist, Harry Potter, lives in the cupboard under the stairs .,
He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys: Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon, and their son, Dudley .,
His only living relatives treat him poorly, making Harry's childhood miserable.Harry's unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain .,
As the novel unfolds, Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world, befriends other students, and comes face-to-face with adversity .,
The twists and turns, mounting suspense, and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book life-changning and unforgettable.Rowling has a rare talent for creating believable, realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses .,
These characters, as some people would say, possess a certain amount of depth .,
Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels .,
Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero: courage, tenacity, and an inclination to protect others .,
Harry is willing to sacrifice everything, including his own life, to ensure the safety of others .,
Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves, whatever the cost.I must admit, Rowling's imagination is extraordinary .,
Her original vision of a young boy sporting a lighting scar who attended boarding school was transformed into a seven book series teeming with the unimaginable .,
Rowling's creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people, magical creatures, and thrilling enchantments .,
The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless .,
No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded, allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the book.As the plot unfolded, readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series .,
Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook .,
These seemingly insignificant details, however, have a large impact upon later events within the book .,
My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired .,
The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second book.While Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone falls under the "Fantasy" genre, Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel, especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome .,
First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrid's three-headed dog, Fluffy .,
The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology; according to legend, Cerberus, a three-headed dog, ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld .,
The only means of subduing Cerberus (and Fluffy, consequently) is the playing of a lyre .,
Additionally, the Hogwarts motto, "Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus," is Latin for "Never tickle a sleeping dragon." Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the series.I am most impressed not with the books themselves, but with the author whose rags-to-riches life story has inspired countless people worldwide .,
J.K. Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire, England .,
She was accepted at the University of Exeter, where she studied Classics .,
She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation, having suffered from multiple sclerosis .,
Several years later, Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter, Jessica .,
The unhappy couple separated 13 months after their marriage .,
Homeless, penniless, and caring for a newborn, Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide .,
We almost lost the brilliant, talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon .,
Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations .,
Despite her challenges, Rowling's perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to life.Overall, this series is the most memorable from my childhood .,
I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters, suspenseful plot, and flawless writing style .,
I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater, eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis .,
For Halloween last year, in fact, I dressed up in an old pair of robes, pulled on a wig, and drew a scar on my forehead .,
And to this day, I find myself reciting quotes from the series .,
I was crushed after the release of the final book, feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series .,
Looking back, I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series, committing it to memory .,
The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time; it has helped to shape the person I am today .,
There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,
Let's be honest here .,
If you're reading my reviews and haven't read this series, you're probably an adult, which means two things .,
One is that you have lived through this series releasing 7 novels, 8 movies, and becoming a cultural phenomenon .,
If you're here, you felt that societal pressure to read this, or one of your friends won't shut up until you do (probably) .,
There is little chance the hype can withstand reality .,
And that is partly because.There's a decent chance you won't like this book .,

you aren't eleven years old .,
This book is written for children .,
Yes, the books get darker and more mature (and much better) later on, but this one is for middle school aged kids.This is my first time rereading book 1 in at least 6 years .,
This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book .,
The main characters are dumb, the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment, and in order for some events to make any sense, one has to create their own head-canon .,
Typically at such points, I stop, remind myself that this is a children's book, and get a glass of Maker's 46.But forgive them I do .,
Rowling creates a fantastic world, characters, and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it .,
If I were reading this for the first time today, I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me .,
But I do know that having read the rest of the series, it didn't even cross my mind not to finish this reread, despite seeing all of the problems .,
The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry, so while we never get adult novels, we do get much "better" writing in later books .,
If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off, I encourage you to keep going for another couple of books.As a final note, my rating for this book is for the series .,
I can't honestly rate this book by itself at this point .,
I first picked up The Philosopher's Stone about seven years ago .,
I'd gone from reading true crime and biographies, to having just finished the Twilight saga, when the Harry Potter series was recommended to me .,
From memory I think I read the first two chapters and then put it down .,
It felt really young and I felt it just wasn't for me .,
So I moved on .,
After starting my IG account I was constantly bombarded with people telling me how amazing the series was and how I had to read it .,

This book was brilliant!,
It was enchanting and captivating and magical .,
I was completely engrossed from the very first page .,
I absolutely adored the friendship between Harry and Ron, and the dynamic was completed once Hermione was accepted into the little group .,
And Hermione, boy she was awesome!,
She had me grinning from ear to ear .,
I'm so intrigued by Snape, and I can't wait to peel back all his layers to see what he has hidden .,
And then there's the gentle giant that is Hagrid .,
My heart is so full of love for him .,
My favourite character so far!,
I can't tell you how incredibly happy I am to have given this series a second chance .,
I can now officially say I'm well on my way to being a Potterhead!,
Because everyone on the planet excluding me and maybe some of the Kardashians have read this series, I'll skip the plot summary and go for a less formal review .,
I can see why so many people adore Harry Potter .,

Each of the characters has a distinct personality, and Rowling's simple writing style leaves room for brevity and enough imagery to pull you into the setting .,
Story-wise, she includes all of the necessary s: foreshadowing, conflicts that escalate to the climax, a pretty satisfying plot twist, etc.I'll probably read one other book in between each installment of this series .,
I'm looking forward to seeing the characters mature and the plot become darker as many others have said it will!,
Rereading this magical book with these beautiful illustrations was such a new experience .,
Generally I had so much fun rereading this because I discovered so many little details I hadn't noticed the first time .,
But this new excitement of a page turner was amazing .,
I was so excited to see if there was going to be an illustration on the next page and how it would look like .,

So I've watched almost all the movies and then at a certain point I stopped and I promised myself that I wouldn't watch the last three movies, not until I would have read the series. .,
Well after 14 years I've finally had the courage to start this Saga and I'm so ashamed that I've waited so long. .,
This book is adorable, perfect, I loved it!!!,
And I've already started the second one!!!,
Have to make up for all the years I've lost!,
D: But I've chosen to read it in my language, italian ;). .,
It's funny how a bad memory can influence you .,
Stupid Me!!!,
I almost risked never reading this wonderful saga.. .,

-----Dopo quattordici anni sono finalmente riuscita a trovare il "coraggio" per iniziare questa saga .,
Eh si, coraggio .,
Dopo il trauma subito da piccola avevo paura di riprendere questo testo .,
Ogni volta che pensavo alla saga di Harry Potter mi rivedevo piccola, seduta accanto alla mia professoressa d'inglese che mi invitava a leggere e cerchiare tutte le parole che non comprendevo (che erano tantissime, considerando che ero appena uscita da ESL - classe per alunni stranieri nelle scuole americane - da pochissimo) .,
E quindi successivamente non ho mai piU+00F9 voluto saperne di HARRY POTTER!,
Dannazione!!!!,
. .,
quanto mi pento di non aver trovato il coraggio prima. .,
per fortuna Harry Potter U+00E8 in grado di stupire non solo i bambini!!!,
Dopo un paio di mesi dalla lettura del testo la scuola ci portU+00F2 a vedere il nuovo film di Harry Potter al cinema, ma che dire. .,
il film mi rapU+00EC completamente .,
Non vi era nessuno che mi osservava, solo io ed Harry .,
Ed iniziai a vedere anche i film successivi .,
Ma poi dopo il quarto mi imposi di fermarmi .,
Dovevo leggere la Saga di Harry Potter!,
. .,
beh dopo tanti anni eccomi qui!!!,
Harry forgive me!!!,
But I'm all yours now. .,
ready to fly to Hogwarts with you!Questo libro U+00E8 dolcissimo!!!,
Harry, Ron, Hermione. .,
ohhh can't wait to see how the love between the two grows!!!,
che non stanca mai, che ti tiene incollata alle pagine!,
Un testo davvero unico, con protagonisti straordinari. .,
e sto solo all'inizio!,
Non vedo l'ora di continuare. .,
beh in realtU+00E0 giU+00E0 sto leggendo il secondo!,
Misteri, magia, amici, nemici, incanti, scope volanti, pozioni, intrighi, lotte,, tanti ingredienti squisiti che non possono non suscitare una forte emozione .,
Amore .,
STUPENDO!!!I need more!!!!,
Ok, so this was my first time reading this book (don't judge me) .,
While I wasn't quite as enamored with it as the thousands of adoring fans (the ones who have read them over and over and over) have been, this wasn't a bad read .,
I did have to keep reminding myself that this was a children's book, and I'm WAY past the target age!,

My son and daughter-in-law, along with the RMFAO group, have been after me to read these books .,
I'm actually looking forward to reading the rest of the books, just to see how the books, and the characters, grow up .,
I haven't seen the movies, but I don't live under a rock either, and I know that each book progressively ages with the characters, turning from children's books with child-like problems, to books with adult issues and adult responses from the characters .,
I'm really hoping that things in the next books aren't so easy for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to solve .,
That's probably my biggest complaint, and why it "only" got four stars from me: everything was too easy, that the mysteries were laid out too simply and were easily solved .,
They were clever, and again, I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't written with me in mind.This first book was entertaining, as I've said, but it wasn't a five-star read (I'm going to be in trouble for that statement, I think!) .,
It reminded me of a mash-up between the old Hardy Boysancy Drew books (kids solving crimes with skills well beyond their age or abilities) and Scooby-Doo .,
Yes, Scooby-Doo!,
Especially at the end when the real bad guy was revealed (it wasn't who they thought it was), and the bad guy's reaction was, "Darn you, meddling kids!" (or something very similar) .,
:DOn to the next book!,
I started reading this for the Nth time 3 days before the death of Alan Rickman, who played Snape in the adaptations- in my opinion the best thing about them .,
It was sad, heartbreaking really, to think of his character just beginning his journey again for me through this reading, while the man who played him so excellently had just passed away .,
I love the adventure and magic of these books, but I especially love the journey we take with Snape's character .,
He is everything .,

[re-read August 2015] I won't write a full review, since pretty much everyone knows how this book goes!,
I'm just amazed by the amount of foreshadowing!,
JK Rowling must have exactly known how the story would evolve .,
I don't mind that this book is short, when I think of OOTP for example, I find the beginning (before they go to Hogwarts) too long and often boring. .,

It wasn't as fun after Order of the Phoenix and the bitching commenced .,
Yeah, there were problems .,
But I'm not organized, I don't wanna die, and I never really cared how it ended as much as I cared about focusing on the cool little stuff.I got into the series after Prisoner of Azkaban came out and before Goblet of Fire .,
(So it wasn't the movies or that Daniel Radcliffe was -then- Elijah Wood before he was uglier.) What made me want to read them?,
The Dursleys .,
I thought they sounded wonderfully delicious (they are hilarious .,
I love it when Vernon tells everyone that Harry attends "St .,
Brutus' Center for Incurably Criminal Boys" .,
His Japanese golfer joke .,
When playing trivia games with friends I'd piss myself with excitement if I got a muggle question .,
"Vernon's drill company is called Grunnings!,
Yes!,
I'm more amazing than all of you put together!" Wonder why no one plays reindeer games with me anymore..) I love muggles.I loved the stupid shit .,
No, not the mythology references .,
Yaaay she read Shakespeare .,
My Uncle Remus did too .,
Not even that she listened to The Smiths and The Beatles while coming up with the series (I do love that) .,
I loved the Aberforth goat stuff .,
I loved the names of Lockhart's books (Gadding with Ghouls, Year with the Yeti, etc.) and the little humor stuff she slips in .,
I can still quote asshole-y things that Draco Malfoy taunted them with (Potter stinks!) and can't remember the basic plot twists .,
I was a card carrying Potterite (laminated!) .,
Sigh .,
I do miss wondering what was going to happen next .,
I miss having that place to retreat to in my mind .,
I'd go on my favorite Harry forum and have fun making up theories (I was right about EVERYYTHING *coughs*) .,
I'm jealous of JK Rowling for having that place in her mind .,
Yeah, I've got my own stories .,
But I don't think I have as much fun with mine (probably because I'm not a sadistic murderer like she is) .,
I liked the books better before they grew up .,
Rowling couldn't write a love story for anything .,
I hated it whenever Ron was mad at Harry .,
My favorite Buffy seasons to watch when depressed are the first three because the core group are still together .,
I love the togetherness .,
(Aberforth was eventually important in the last book .,
That almost ruined it.)P.s .,
In case I didn't look dorky enough. .,
I used to get into rabid debates about the English to American changes with the transatlantic fans .,
They were all like: "Americans are so dumb that you don't understand what Philosopher means." I delivered eighteen shots to their stomach with my comebacks about Lee not being black in their versions, JK Rowlings name being JK in the first place (it doesn't mean Just Kidding .,
The publishers thought boys wouldn't read a female author), and their effing ugly covers (English kids lose so often .,
No Edward Gorey for Joan Aiken's books!) .,
I did know that jumper meant sweater .,
It's not just a Hayden Christensen vehicle .,
I found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,
When they were released there were not a lot of children's books that were set in the world of magic .,
I think for me the greatest thing about this book is, it teaches children and adults alike that, you can achieve anything you wish even when you think that it is impossible .,
I also think the theme of friendship is important, people can be friends whether you agree with everything about them or not, Hermione is a great example of that throughoutI found the idea of this series of books wonderful .,

She tells them it is to keep them out of trouble, but I believe deep down she is actually happy that she has found people that like a bit of adventure, it is something new to her .,
One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is, why Harry was left with the Dursley's after the death of his parents .,
Although it is clear that Harry is not treated very well at all, I think this was the best place for Harry to grow up .,
Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability, they teach Harry a very valuable lesson..kindness, when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts, he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursley's .,
They also have taught him how to stand up for himself when he is taunted by Draco Malfoy.Rowling has the ability to create a world that every reader of these books wishes to enter and never leave .,
With owls that deliver the mail, a magical school where anything is possible and lets not forget the moving pictures, Hogwarts is a place that will live in the hearts of fans for years to come .,
All and all a great start to what looks like a fantastic series .,
If you are a fan of all things magical and have not delved into the world of Harry Potter yet, I would highly recommend you give this series a chance .,

But so good .,
I love it just as much IF NOT EVEN MORE .,
This is such a wonderful read!!,

But we're not stupid-we know we're called Gred and Forge.U+201D Originally posted on Stellar Scrutiny Book Blog.Well, it turns out all those Muggles were rightU+2026 I didnU+2019t enjoy reading until a few years ago .,
Having suffered through so many years of school required reading, I couldnU+2019t look at a book without thinking of essays!,
Not to mention my distaste for writing at the time .,
All that changed however, with one book that was so magnificent, it must have been a gift from God!,
It completely altered my view of books .,
What was this holy novel, you might be asking?,
U+2026It wasnU+2019t Harry Potter .,
It was The Hunger Games .,
As my eyes were opened to the Young Adult genre, my love of reading began .,
Shortly after reading The Hunger Games, I made a deal with my friend, who passionately loved the Harry Potter books and had been trying to get me to read them for quite some time .,
If she read the first Hunger Games book, IU+2019d read the first Harry Potter book .,
Flash forward a few months, and wouldnU+2019t you know it, my friend read the whole trilogy!,
Did I breeze through all seven Harry Potter books in a week?,
HAHAHAHAHA, NO.You want to know the best part?,
That was 3 years agoU+2026I had been hearing about Harry Potter since I knew how to read, but really disliked the concept of it .,
It's just about some stupid boy who goes to a school for wizards!,
Also, I've heard it rips off Lord of the Rings, so I'm going to stay as far away from it as possible..See, the funny thing about this is, I actually knew nothing about Harry Potter .,
Nothing .,
Zip .,
Nada .,
I hadn't even seen more than 5 minutes of the movies!,
*gasps* After having a hundred or so people threatening me to read it, out of fear for my life, I complied .,
I certainly am glad I did .,
It was incredible!,
Absolutely stupendous!,
The Characters "So light a fire!" Harry choked .,
"Yes..of course..but there's no wood!""HAVE YOU GONE MAD!" Ron bellowed .,
"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT!,
Harry.Undoubtedly, my favorite part of this beautiful book was its beautiful characters .,
Harry, Hermione, Ron, Fred, George..I love them all!,
Ironically, Harry was my least favorite of the trio .,
Not that I didn't like him, but he just didn't have as distinct of a personality as Hermione and Ron .,
However, I still admired his loyalty and selflessness .,
I'm really excited to see how his character develops throughout the series.Hermione.Is it bad if I see a lot of myself in Hermione?,
Haha .,
I can be the occasional smart-alec who gets all up in your business..so, naturally, I love Hermione Granger .,
She wasn't a Mary Sue!,
She was intelligent, loyal, and feisty!,
There really should be more heroines like her .,
I also have brown hair, brown eyes, and am Muggle-born..We're practically the same person.Ron.He was pretty great too .,
Having four siblings (two of which, are twins), I can relate to him .,
Ron and Hermione's bickering was positively priceless, and he had more than a few memorable remarks .,
He was the comedy relief of the whole book, and it wouldn't be the same without him.Malfoy .,
I was really hoping this little git would get devoured by Fluffy.Other characters .,
Hagrid, was hilarious, and is it strange if I am particularly fond of Hedwig?,
Dumbledore didn't really have that much screen time, so I don't really know what to think of him..yet .,
My favorite, or should I say favorites, are definitely Gred and Froge .,
*wink* I swear, I was cracking up over every dialogue they had .,
As a matter of fact, I loved all the Weasleys .,
U+201CNow, you two U+2013 this year, you behave yourselves .,
If I get one more owl telling me you've U+2013 you've blown up a toilet or U+2013""Blown up a toilet?,
We've never blown up a toilet.""Great idea though, thanks, Mum.U+201D The World Building I finally see why everyone admires J.K. Rowling .,
Hogwarts and the wizard world she creates is whimsically ingenious .,
Honestly, why can't Quidditch be a real sport?,
It's fantastic!,
I want to ride a broom stick and hit flying balls into peoples' faces!,
All flavor jelly beans?,
How awesome is that?,
Apparently, you can buy them from Amazon..including earwax flavor (Eww, wasn't licorice bad enough?) .,
I'm not kidding, look it up!,
Rowling did a marvelous job of luring me into Potter's world .,
The only aspect of the universe that puzzles me, is where exactly is Hogwarts?,
Is it in a different universe from our reality?,
If so, how are Harry and Ron (I started a wee bit on Chamber of Secrets..as soon as I finished this one) able to fly a car there?!,
What I Loved U+269C The protagonist and side characters .,
Lovely, lovely, lovely characters .,
Rowling did a spectacular job of creating such a hilarious and realistic cast.U+269C The plot was highly entertaining .,
Though a little short, Harry and his friends' adventure was incredibly entertaining and I am especially curious about what other secrets Hogwarts holds..U+269C Rowling's writing was pleasant and engaging .,
A little simple, yes, but short and sweet .,
What else should I expect from a Middle Grade novel?U+269C The plot twist in the end .,
I'm not going to lie, I felt quite childish that I didn't see it coming .,
It was so obvious, yet I was too busy laughing over Harry swallowing Quidditch balls to notice what was right in front of me.U+269C The villains .,
*claps* Well done, Rowling .,
Well done .,
What I Didn't Love U+269C The pacing .,
A short novel?,
Understandable .,
An abrupt ending?,
Inexcusable .,
Final Thoughts I hope all you Muggles are happy now!,
I finally did it!Harry Potter was so wonderful!,
I really should've read it all those years ago .,
The characters were exceptional, story incredible, writing amiable..honestly, what else can I say, other than it truly was a magical book .,
I'll absolutely be finishing this series .,
:)  .,
WHY DIDN'T I READ THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER .,
THIS IS EPIC .,
FUCKING EPIC .,
_____________________________________________________________Guys my little sister just came put to me with this book in her hand and asked if I wanted to BR with her .,
She looked so happy when I said yes .,
It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,
I'd heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon, but still I didn't feel compelled to read the books .,
I've been reader all my life but I don't know, I was kinda undecided about it .,
Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watchingIt was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter .,

Then, the films came out, and I started to watch them, and still I wasn't eager to read the books, since I thought, hey, I am watching the films, so what may I am losing about the story (oh boy!,
how wrong I was!) .,
I had some good surprises because I wasn't reading the books like in the third movie .,
When I watched the fourth film, Goblet of Fire, I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book BUT it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books .,
Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish, he had an edition on English of the first book, this one, and since by then I already was reading on English, he lent me the book .,
Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books .,
I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that it's not mine, still I don't want to have books, etc. .,
that are not mine under my care .,
Still, my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish .,
Since I wasn't SO convinced to read the books, I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book .,
I started to reading it. .,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Right in the first pages, when Hagrid mentioned WHO lent him out the flying motorcycle!!!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Keep on mind that I already watched 4 films by then, so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle, mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga!,
OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
Then, I knew that J.K. Rowling was a wicked genius!!!,
And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book, since certain character that appears in the first book, then I said "Oh, boy, what a boring chapter, why did J.K. bothered to create such unimportant character?" and I was starting to read the fifth book and. .,
"Mmh. .,
where I heard about this character before..where?..mmmh..OH MY GOODNESS!!!,
NO!!!,
IT CAN'T BE!!!" .,
By then, I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW!,
Yes, it was the same character!!!,
Right in the first book!!!,
So, re-confirmed like for the umpteenth time. .,
J.K. Rowling is a wicked genius!!!,
I enjoyed a lot reading the first book .,
J.K. Rowling has a very interesting style of writing .,
Also, the first book is very good combining the magical world with the normal things that people has to do when kids are beginning school .,
Going to buy the school supplies .,
Having to deal different kind of teachers .,
Some good, some strict, some both .,
The forming of friendships with schoolmates .,
Indeed a wonderful and magical book .,
Highly recommended .,
I absolutely adore this new edition of Harry Potter and I hope that they will make illustrated versions of all of the books (although they might get quite big..) Getting to experience this story once again, after not having read the book for a long time and this time with beautiful illustrations to complement the story was a truly magnificent experience .,
J.K. Rowling is the queen!!Harry Potter is and will always be one of my all time favorite series  .,
First book down for readalong!,
Doesn't matter how many times I read these books, they're always just as amazing as the first time around!,
So amazing!,

It did get me curious enough to pick up the first book .,
I remember falling love with everything about it, finishing the book quicker than I had finished one before and immediately hungry for the next one.At the time, I didn't know popular the series was. .,
I just knew I loved it and had to read them as quickly as possible .,
By the time I discovered these beautiful books, the first four were already out and OoTP was released not long after. .,
needless to say, I caught on quickly as to how big the fandom was .,
I loved the it all though, it felt like a big family :) I loved to hear people swap theories while waiting in line, and soak the whole atmosphere as we all eagerly waited for the bookstore to open (ours never had midnight release parties but they did open extra early).This is part of my book family :) ---  .,
I never thought it was possible to make Harry Potter BETTER, but Jim Kay has definitely managed it!,

and The Philosopher's Stone is a relatively quick read with either very good, wonderful writing or some of the worst writing imaginable .,
Thankfully, most of the time it was simple children's story writing, which made me feel at home with the book right away.I'll say that the world was rather more lacklustre than I ever really remembered it being .,
It's quite a small world, really, in this first book and there's not an awful lot of world-building, but such a short book I think that's fair enough .,
The plot felt a little badly-stitched together in some places, as if they'd be written separately and then threaded together later .,
There were a few eye-roll moments, and some really ridiculous moments, but there were also some lovely moments, great characters I'd forgotten about and overall a nice flow to how it all panned out.The thing I'm most looking forward to is the development of Hermione .,
I don't really like Harry all that much, and Ron is just one of those "oh, you're here" characters to me, and my favourite Luna won't be turning up for another four books or so, although I didn't remember that Hermione had been purposefully described as Bossy and I'm so excited to see how she changes in the books .,
Honestly, she was always my favourite.I'm glad I'm re-reading the series .,
I'm so glad I'm not going to become obsessed: I'm so glad I'm not going to remove it from my heart altogether, too .,
It's taken a while, and I needn't have been scared to do this, but that's what happens with Harry Potter, I suppose .,

It's sprawling in your bed on a weekend just enjoying a good book that doesn't nag you, but it entertains you .,
It's a great book and you can see why JK Rowling went from being a struggling single mother to a kajillionaire because she is just that good.Not perfect, no writer is, but great enough.It's still very good .,
But dang it, I hate that Hagrid got everyone in trouble!,
Just finished my third reading of this book, which is saying something for someone who doesn't typically re-read anything .,

This is where it all began, where we were introduced to Harry Potter, Rowling's magical world, a series of exciting adventures and the excellent characters and environments she has given to English literature .,
It set the standard for contemporary fantasy .,
Rowling make full use of classic literary and mythological references, freeing herself from the confines of the merely topical, while giving it all a daring sense of newness .,
This series will live forever .,
The number of times I've read this book has gotten out of hand and yet, I can never get tired of reading Harry Potter.Although I believe I should mark this as my first time reading the books in English; all the previous times has been the translated version .,

Wow..nggak kerasa sudah 15 tahun sejak saya kenalan sama Harry Potter dan terpesona pada dunia buatan Madame Rowling ini .,
Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review, tapi sebelum itu, rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir ini.Saya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah, sekitar akhir 1997 .,

Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review, tapi sebelum itu, rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir ini.Saya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah, sekitar akhir 1997 .,
Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilih-milih buku bekas ketika shopkeeper-nya menawari saya buku ini .,
Dia berpromosi kalo ini buku bagus banget dan sayang banget kalo ampe gak saya beli .,
Dia juga bilang kalo Harry Potter ini lagi happening banget di Inggris sana.Waktu itu saya kenal internet cuma sebatas email dan chatting doang, gak pernah browsing .,
Saya pun bukan tipe yang langganan majalah ato koran, jadi saya benar-benar gak tahu kalo ada buku berjudul Harry Potter yang lagi booming .,
Saya malah curiga kalo buku ini adalah buku jelek yang gak laku .,
Ya logikanya aja, kalo emang tuh buku buagus banget kok udah ada yang jual second-nya di Bras Basah?,
Dan kalo emang laris buanget, kenapa juga si shopkeeper maksa-maksa saya buat beli?,
Tebakan saya sih ini buku gak laku dan si shopkeeper mo nepu saya (Oh..how stupid I was).Akhirnya buku Harry Potter 1 itu saya beli juga karena sang shopkeeper menjamin saya boleh tukar dengan buku lain kalo nggak puas .,
Dan begitulah awalnya saya kenal sama Harry Potter.Rasanya saya gak perlu menulis sinopsis buku ini ato bahkan memberi tahu buku ini termasuk dalam genre apa .,
I mean, seriously?,
Sudah 15 tahun lebih sejak demam Harry Potter melanda dunia, it's been all over the news .,
Kalo bahkan ampe detik ini Anda nggak tahu garis besar cerita Harry Potter, berarti Anda emang gak berminat sama buku ini .,
Then why bothers now?,
;)Jadi lebih baik saya membahas apa yang saya rasakan sewaktu membaca kembali buku ini setelah 15 tahun berlalu.Yang pertama saya rasa sih "aura"nya yang beda .,
Sewaktu pertama baca Harry Potter dulu, teman-teman saya gak ada yang ngeh sama buku ini (yah sebenernya ampe sekarang temen saya yang baca buku ini juga sedikit sih :| ) .,
Jadi saya heboh sendiri, bahas buku ini sendirian (dan dapat tatapan loe-ngomong-apa-sih dari teman-teman) bahkan fangirling pun sendirian #kasian .,
Sekarang ini, berkat GR dan BBI, saya jadi kenal banyak orang yang juga ngefans sama Harry Potter bahkan ampe baca bareng .,
Jelas vibe-nya beda banget .,
Dan itu menyenangkan .,
Horeeeee..saya masuk golongan mainstream #hehe.Yang kedua, saya mengubah pandangan saya tentang Harry di buku pertama .,
Awal baca dulu, saya beranggapan Harry ini kepo banget .,
"Kenapa sih pusing banget sama kemungkinan Sorcerer Stone dicuri sama Voldemort?,
Kenapa gak kirim Hedwig aja ke Dumbledore sih buat warning?"-- itu adalah pertanyaan saya dulu.Sekarang saya ngerti kenapa.Seperti yang dibilang Harry, Dumbledore tahu bahwa Harry butuh untuk mencoba melawan karena pertarungan dengan Voldemort itu personal untuk Harry .,
Gimana pun, Voldemort lah yang membunuh orangtua Harry .,
Dan Harry sadar kalo Voldemort bisa kembali menyerang dia.Tapi terutama, karena Harry sadar bahwa kembalinya Voldemort dapat membuat dia kehilangan dunia sihir.He was nothing in the muggle world .,
Gak punya siapa pun dan apa pun .,
Lalu dia menemukan semuanya di dunia sihir : sahabat, kebahagiaan dan terutama : penerimaan .,
Penerimaan yang tak pernah dia dapatkan sebelumnya .,
Gak heran kalo Harry berkeras mempertahankannya .,
I'd do the same if I were him .,
I'd fight the nastiest wizard if I have to in order not to let something most precious being taken from me .,
So I could understand Harry's determination to fight Voldemort even when he's still a kid.Ketiga, ternyata saya sudah suka Ron dari buku ke 1 X).Jangan salah, dari trio itu Ron memang favorit saya kok .,
Saya suka Ron karena kalimatnya yang witty dan rada sarkastis, belum lagi sindirannya yang tajam .,
Tapi kualitas itu baru keliatan di buku kedua (ato malah ketiga?) .,
Yang pasti bukan di buku pertama.Dulu saya gak ngerti apa yang bikin saya bersimpati sama Ron sejak awal .,
Sekarang saya tahu .,
Karena Ron orang pertama yang "menerima" Harry .,
Dia gak meremehkan Harry seperti yang dilakukan Malfoy, tapi dia juga gak memujanya secara berlebihan .,
Dia menganggap Harry sama normalnya dengan dia, and that's enough.Keempat, saya makin kagum dengan persahabatan Ron dan Hermione .,
They're true bestfriends.Tanpa ragu Ron dan Hermione menemani Harry untuk melawan Voldemort walopun mereka tahu resikonya .,
I mean, saya ngerti kesetiaan Ron dan Hermione pada Harry di buku ke-7 .,
They've come a long way .,
Tapi di buku 1?,
Saat mereka baru kenal 1 tahun kurang serta belum ngeh seberapa parah kondisinya kalo Voldemort kembali berkuasa?,
That's great.Kelima, perubahan karakter Neville kerasa banget ya .,
Neville yang penakut dan gak berani membela dirinya sungguh berbeda dengan Neville di buku ke-7 .,
I forgot how awkward, clumsy and shy Neville was .,
But let's talk about him on the later book.Keenam, wow..penerjemah Harry Potter ini keren sekali ya.Saya sudah pernah sih baca versi Inggris dan terjemahan buku ini (untuk reread yang ini, saya baca versi Inggrisnya lagi), dan dari dulu memang saya tahu penerjemahnya emang canggih .,
Tapi baru sekarang saya benar-benar ngeh.Mirror of Erised diterjemahkan Cermin Tarsah .,
Erised yang merupakan anagram dari desire, diterjemahkan jadi tarsah yang anagram dari hasrat .,
Wow!,
Dan setelah saya googling, saya dapat info kalo sebenarnya ide Tarsah ini baru kepikir belakangan, menjelang bukunya turun cetak .,
Karena sang penerjemah berkeras mesti ada padanan yang tepat untuk "erised" .,
Dan iya, beliau emang bener karena erised dan tarsah adalah padanan yang cocok.Ketujuh, hmm..saya tetap gak ngerti kenapa Professor Quirrell gak bisa menyentuh Harry hanya di bagian akhir buku ini?,
Waktu awal cerita, Harry bertemu Prof. Quirrell di Diagon Alley dan saat itu mereka sudah berjabat tangan .,
Kok saat itu tangan si Quirrell gak melepuh ya?,
Padahal sudah jelas kalo Voldemort telah "nebeng" di tubuh Quirrell saat itu.Kedelapan, saya makin kagum deh sama JK Rowling.Oke..saya tahu kalo JKR emang banyak menggunakan bantuan mitos, legenda ato apalah itu dalam ceritanya .,
So it's not really original .,
Tapi toh emang gak ada formula yang benar-benar baru .,
Yang penting sih gimana Rowling bisa meramu bahan yang ada .,
And she's really good at it.Tapi yang sebenarnya keren dari Rowling adalah : dia benar-benar paham karakter pembacanya.I guess in some points of our life, even if it's just for one time, we ever felt like Harry, who's a misfit and wishing to go to some place new where we could start everything from the scratch or becoming a different people .,
But not everyone could do that .,
Apparently Harry is one of those lucky people.Reading Harry's journey gave me happiness .,
Happiness that comes from knowing that at least there's one person in this world who could fulfill his dreams .,
It also gave me some hopes that in the end everything will be fine for me too .,
If this boy whose life was much more miserable than me finally found what he always wanted, how could I not?,
:)Dan Rowling juga dengan cerdasnya memilih setting di Inggris, suatu tempat yang masih bisa terjangkau dan karenanya masih terasa "dekat" .,
Bukannya tempat jauh antah berantah seperti di Middle Earth sana, atau dunia magic namun tak terjangkau seperti Abarat .,
Terlibatnya kaum manusia non sihir (aka muggle) juga tempat-tempat di Inggris seperti stasiun King's Cross membuat cerita ini makin terasa dekat di hati, membuat kita (oke..sebenernya sih saya) berani berharap bahwa suatu saat nanti saya juga bisa dapat.ehem..surat saya sendiri .,
Seorang teman saya bahkan sampe mencoba menekan pilar di tempat yang semestinya jadi peron 9 3/4 waktu dia lagi ada di King's Cross dan waktu salah seorang petugas di sana melihat kelakuan teman saya, si petugas bilang : "You're not the first person who tried looking for that platform." Bhahak..ternyata banyak yang bermimpi ke Hogwarts eh?,
;)Dan alasan kenapa saya kasih 5 bintang walopun saya mengakui kalo cerita di buku ini masih kalah spekta dibanding buku-buku berikutnya?Karena ini adalah buku pertama .,
The one that started it all .,
Buku ini juga yang bikin saya kenal dan jadi langganan (sampe sekarang) sama sebuah toko di Bras Basah itu .,
It's always nice to find a new friend because of one certain book.Lastly, just wanna say this : for you all who feel like you don't fit in, who wished for a magical school, or secret garden or magical cupboard that could open secret passage to magical land and still secretly keeping those wish alive : keep on wishing .,
Keep on hoping .,
Who knows, maybe your "letter" is on its way now :)  .,

Before I share some photos of my favorite illustrations here are some thoughts about the overall book: This may be one of those things that is more of a collectors item versus an essential book for reading .,
It was fun and offered me a whole different experience to reading the book in general, but I'm not so sure I would be so quick to pick it up again for pure reading purposes .,
It is very large and heavy .,
It is awkward to hold and can be difficult to read if you do your reading in bed (guilty) .,
Like I mentioned, it enhances the reading experience but not completely essential to enjoying the book .,
Now, I don't have kids and the last picture book I read was Berenstein Bears .,
I did personally find the images to be on the darker side and more wacky and whimsical instead of soft and child-like (whatever that means) .,
I feel like these illustrations may appeal to more adults than kids but I don't read to kids before bed or even know what kids like .,
I don't even have the faintest idea who Jim Kay illustrates for so take that tidbit with a grain of salt .,
Here are some of my favorite illustrations so enjoy!,
The house in the middle of the ocean .,
Harry and Hagrid .,
Diagon Alley .,
Hogwarts Express - full version of the cover .,
Some insanely cool ghosts .,
(Prob my fav of the book - not sure why I abbreviated those words) The potions master!,
(view spoiler)[Also affectionately referred to as the Half-Blood Prince .,
(hide spoiler)] I loved Hagrid's hut in this book!,
I would visit this place every weekend too if I could!!!!So there's that for you!,
I really just posted all of these for Sean so I hope he enjoys them!["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>["br"]>[Also affectionately referred to as the Half-Blood Prince .,

I've read this book a few of dozen times over the years .,
I've tried, each time, to figure out how to put into words my feelings on it .,
I fail every time .,
But here I am, trying once again .,
I'm going to try and speak of just this book in this review - so (beyond these few statements) I won't touch on how incredibly built the series is .,

I'm going to try and speak of just this book in this review - so (beyond these few statements) I won't touch on how incredibly built the series is .,
Each book is builds on the ones before it, widening and strengthening the world .,
There are foreshadowings and moments peppered throughout the series that sometimes don't come into play for many books to come .,
As Harry grows and becomes more mature, so too do these books .,
It's something that's almost impossible to realize here, in the first one, and that I still appreciate each and every time I pick up this series.When I first picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone I had no idea the impact it would have on my life .,
It was just a story, about a boy that finds out he's a wizard and has to fight the forces of evil .,
That's what I thought when I started it that first time .,
Very quickly I was drawn into the world of magic that J.K. Rowling penned, surrounded by witches and wizards, magic, and muggles .,
When I try to examine my feelings for this (and all future books), I run into the problem of not being able to quantify what makes it so special .,
The story is a classic; boy finds out he's special, learns about world, fights evil, wins .,
The world is intricate and fun, with a lot of cleverness - plays on words, simple ciphers, and logic puzzles made me smile - while still being straightforward .,
The characters, though varied and three-dimensional, are fairly standard.And yet, this all combines into this wonderful, fantastical world that pulls me in and makes me wonder what's hiding behind that brick wall over there, or what I might be missing out of the corner of my eye.I remember, distinctly, the feeling of sorrow that I had upon finishing this first book and realizing I was already too old to get a letter to Hogwarts .,
The world is so enchanting that I can't help but want to be a part of it .,
It's all about the feeling that it evokes in me .,
It makes me feel like there's magic in the world, and it's not necessarily the turn-a-mouse-into-a-snuff-box type of magic, or the type where the chess pieces actually fight each other (though, how awesome would that be?) .,
It's the type where friendship is stronger than anything that gets thrown at it .,
Where people, kids, can fight against injustice and wrong - and win .,
It lets you know that life isn't always fair, and that you might have to battle against things that are scary and horrible, but the happiness at the end is always worth it.And I suppose that's what keeps me coming back, time and time again, to re-read, revisit, and relive this story .,
It makes me feel a part of something amazing.And that is definitely magical.Review also available at The Book EatersHarry Potter holds a forever-place in my heart .,
His story is one of my favorites ever .,
This re-read just reinforced that thought .,
Pathetic .,
Really pathetic.Harry Potter is more of a Mary-Sue than Eragon .,
More than Nancy Drew .,
More than the worst of fanfiction I've seen.He's rich, popular and famous for absolutely nothing of his own doing .,
He destroys the power of the big bad guy before he's a year old .,
He has the whole angsty past down pat .,
He instantly becomes the best at flying without ever having done it before, wasting all the older and more experienced flyers .,
And get this - he fries bad guys when they touch his skinPathetic .,

And get this - he fries bad guys when they touch his skin because the power of his mother's love is so amazing that it protects him.I mean, gosh, the only Sueish habit we aren't subjected to is multipage rants on his appearance each morning .,
Or the devoted unicorn of unusual powers, of course, but I'm expecting him to show up in the very next book .,
After all, she has to keep some plot devices for the next one, doesn't she?,
Can't put all her brilliant twists out at once..*heavy sarcasm*Don't even get me started on the plot .,
Epic failure .,
'Nuff said.Harry wasn't any excuse for a hero .,
He did nothing, he just sat around and things happened to him .,
End of story .,
His fame was inherited, his fortune was inherited, he lived with his relations and allowed them to bully him, and couldn't even manage to read his own mail .,
His wonderful skills were not worked at and studied for years but picked up instantly, and he bet the bad guys by electrocuting them with his infamous zapper skin.I could go on for hours .,
The thing that really gets to me is that this is the great literature of our age?,
What hope is there for any decent writers if all kids want to read is this utter garbage?,
What hope is there for the world if kids are growing up thinking this is good literature?This is a dangerous book .,
It made me consider both suicide and mass homicide, and it is definitely not suitable for children .,

This might just be the very first book I've ever read in English .,
I was in high school at the time .,
I remember desperately trying to find out the meaning of the word "tantrum" .,
Hahaha!,
The good old days .,
I need to find the time to reread this series, and its last book .,
I've never had the strength to finish reading the last one .,
It launched the year I had my son .,
It felt too much reading it .,
I didn't want it to end .,
That was nine years ago .,
I think it's high time I read it .,
5* I can now say, I finally see what all the fuss is about in these delightfully woven, darling little characters .,
Sheesh .,
I even teared up at Hagrid's present to him .,
I have discovered that I am beyond a sap.I just had to add this in because it also made me cry..my goodness..I am a mess with tears over all humanity this year..http://www.bbc.co.ukewsbeat/article. .,
ReseU+00F1a:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKbYJ..No hay palabras  .,
I loved that I remembered this so well .,
It's still just as amazing and everyone has got to read them at some point .,
What can I say. .,
I don't trust people who don't love Harry Potter, because I adore this book and all that magical world .,
I mean, it's Harry Potter, what not to like :)  .,

As originally written the series (considering the time between publication of each volume) actually grew with the first generation of kids who read them .,
They do get gradually darker as they go on, but (originally) the children who'd started were growing to .,
So, they actually matured with the story .,
(My only caveat is that parents should be sure their children are mature enough now to move to each volume .,
Now a ten year old could conceivably buy the set and read them one after the other, so, parents need to be proactive and be sure their "youths" are ready, mature enough for each book.)I'm amazed at how much I still "feel" I know these characters and care about them even though they are fictional in a fantasy world .,
It's an accomplishment that's seen in the best of novels .,
Congratulations Ms.Rowling .,
While they have their flaws these are wonderful books .,
I had started to give them 4 stars, I give very few 5 star ratings .,
BUT upon consideration, I realized I'd read them several times and still enjoyed them greatly .,
These are wonderfully written novels .,
I rate it 5 stars.This novel opens the story of Harry Potter, the boy who lived .,
We get to meet Harry, his aunt, uncle and cousin .,
We are introduced to the "wizarding world" and we go to Hogworts .,
And of course, we meet Ron and Hermione .,
I'd say if you're not charmed by this book and don't find yourself caring about Harry and his friends..maybe you should check for Grinch blood- Enjoy .,
Harry Potter changed my life .,
I don't say this lightly.I was very young when I started reading these, I was 9 .,
The librarian at the ary I was attending pulled me aside and gave me this book to take home to read, her own personal copy, because at the time Harry Potter hadn't been read and approved for the library yet .,
She may have broke some rules at the time, but I'll bet she doesn't know that breaking that rule made me who I am today.This story is magical .,
Literally .,
I re-read this serieHarry Potter changed my life .,

I re-read this series every year .,
Every September .,
Sometimes twice a year if I feel the need .,
No matter how old I get, when I pick up these books I feel like a kid again .,
You don't have to be a kid to love Harry Potter, you don't have to like fantasy to like Harry Potter, you don't even have to be a big reader to love Harry Potter .,
All you have to do is open your mind (and your heart :').) Please pick up one of these books if you haven't yet .,
I don't care if you're 6 or 60, they will enlighten you to a whole new world .,
They will make you feel happiness, sadness, anger, all of the feelings, all of the time .,
I LOVE YOU J.K. ROWLING .,
I mean that .,
haha .,
I simply adored this book I'm not used to read books after I watched the movies, but it'll be that way with my Harry Potter books, because I'm a huge fan of the movies and I've already saw them all .,
The good thing is that I don't really remember anything at all, haha (just the "big" parts .,

To make the reviews more entertaining, I will be doing them in a variety of unexpected formats .,
For this review, I will be writing as someone incapable of suspending his disbelief.This book was terrible!,
I mean, this author is obviously on drugs or insane or something like that, and why she has been allowed to publish such patent nonsense is beyond me .,
What is even more horrifying is that so many people, adults and children, are supporting this madwoman .,
I mean, even some of my friends and family, people I respect have come under her spell!Her spell .,
Ha!,
As though such things as spells and magic really exist .,
I know she and her hoard of followers believe so, but we, the right-thinking, rational people of the world know better, don't we?The beginning was okay, and I had high hopes for it .,
I thought it might be an interesting story about this family, the Dursleys, who seem to be people after my own heart .,
Sensible, no-nonsense folk, these, who know what's real and what isn't .,
But within ten pages, I knew something wasn't right .,
Think about this - some crazy old man in robes shows up with a tiny device that can put out streetlights from a distance?,
A cat changes into a woman?,
Outrageous!,
And then the flying motorcycle, and nonsensical ravings about magicians and dark lords and curses, and that's where it all started to go downhill.I forced myself to slog through this mess of nonsense, though by the time I got to chapter five, I had pretty much given up .,
Nothing this book describes could possibly take place in the real world, and it is almost criminal that she should get this kind of fame and attention .,
She is a font of nonsense and mayhem, poisoning the minds of everyone her work touches .,
If you haven't read these books, I recommend that you stay away from them .,
If you have, then I beg you to come to your senses and embrace the real world .,
Give up this madness and join us over here in the world where truth is truth and Harry Potter is meaningless vapor .,

I finally get Harry Potter!,
I know it's not exactly rocket science, but I didn't fully understand the obsessive fascination with this series until I read the first book to my kids .,
They were absolutely RIVETED the entire time .,
Every magical enchantment was rewarded with an "ooohhh" and "ahhh," every one of Ron's jokes met with hysterical laughter, and I could actually watch my son and daughter grow stronger with each impossible obstacle or horrific monster Harry overcame .,
In one early scene, Leah literally started crying when Harry thought he would be thrown out of school and sent back to the Dursley's .,
Now THAT is a sure sign of someone who is LIVING a book, not reading it.So that's why my kids loved it .,
Here's why *I* loved it: Harry is strong .,
He stands up for what is right regardless of who stands against him (friend, enemy, authority figure, incorporeal undead wizard of darkness, etc.), which makes him a powerful hero for my 4- and 6-year-old .,
He's brave, self-sacrificing, and honorable .,
I think Harry proves his own character, and addresses the book's central theme itself, in a scene he shares with Malfoy near the beginning of his time at Hogwarts .,
In this particular scene, Malfoy gives a snotty little spiel on how he can introduce Harry to the best wizarding families and help him stay away from the "wrong sort." Harry then refuses to shake Malfoy's hand and responds, "I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks." And isn't that the essence of growing up?,
Moving away from simply doing what others tell us to do and learning to discern right and wrong for ourselves?,
Then, as soon as we know what's right, we can work on growing strong enough to stand up for it regardless of who stands against us .,
Harry is brilliant!,
Almost as brilliant as his author, who's created a story that is both wonderful and wonderfully told .,
Bravo!MEG'S FAVORITE QUOTES (and, of course, Dumbledore says most of them):Scars can come in handy.Harry wished he had about eight more eyes .,
The very dust and silence seemed to tingle with some secret magic.From that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend .,
There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.One can never have enough socks.Death is but the next great adventure.Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.The truth. .,
is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.To have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever .,
It is in your very skin.There are all kinds of courage .,
It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends .,
What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said?,
I can only tell you my experience in reading it for the very first time in the form of the illustrated version .,
I had such a great time reading this book .,
I had only watched a handful of the films prior to picking it up and had forgotten many of the scenes, so this story had some surprises for me .,
But just as wonderful in the surprise department were the amazing illustrations which never intruded upon the story and only enhanced it .,

But just as wonderful in the surprise department were the amazing illustrations which never intruded upon the story and only enhanced it .,
Other than viewing some of them online, I purposefully didn't peek ahead in the book, but waited until the illustrations were revealed as the story unfolded, never knowing what I'd find as I turned each page .,
Would there be this scene or that one next?,
And from which perspective would I get to view something--from above, from below, or from straight on?,
Which character would I get to see next?,
How much color or detail would there be?,
How much emotion would be conveyed?,
Not every page had an official illustration on it, but every page had a little something extra included that made it a treat to look at, whether the page looked marbled or had mysterious looking splotches on it .,
But even when there were full color illustrations on a page, I was able to use my imagination just as well as if there hadn't been any at all .,
Mr. Kay really did this book credit .,
I'm very happy for him since he was so worried that he wouldn't .,
http://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what..But getting back to the story, which I haven't even talked about yet, what I liked best about it were the growing bonds between the characters, the slippery lines between good and evil, the many forms in which bravery appeared, the hope and optimism stirring in the hearts and minds of the characters, even when all seemed lost, and finally, the magic woven within this book which had nothing to do with the spells cast .,
I don't know why I waited so long to begin this series, but in a way I'm glad I did, just so I could kick off reading it with this very special edition .,
I wish I could wait to read all the books in this form, but no way!,
I'm sure I'll have read the entire series before the next illustrated book comes out .,
Then I guess I'll just have to read them again in the illustrated form .,
I will have no problem at all doing that .,

You meet Harry .,
You learn a tiny bit about who he is and why he is with his Aunt and Uncle at the very beginning of the book .,
You learn quickly to DESPISE his Aunt and Uncle and lovely cousin Dudley .,
ICK!And then you go to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry .,
What an awesome place .,
I know that there has to be other people other than myself that wish that this was a real place and that we could all go there .,
Ghosts, pictures that move from one frame to another and 3-headed dogs named Fluffy!You also learn about Voldemort, who is the reason Harry has to live with the Dursley's in the first place .,
Voldemort killed Harry's parents, and tried to kill Harry, but the spell backfired!,
So Voldemort is wandering around out in the world just biding his time when he can come back and finish Harry off !!There is so much going on in this book, that I feel you have to read it more than once to get it all .,
Fantastic read!!!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I have reread this book so many times; I think this is my 6th reread of it [possibly more] and I never kept track .,
I will be doing so from this point forward!,
:-)Reread September 18, 2016I still love this book so very much .,
I love how you discover everything right along with Harry .,
It is always such a joy to reread this book .,
I do an annual re-reading of this series around winter time .,
December is the ideal time to start because Harry Potter has always seemed like a winter type series to me .,
I don't know why or how I started this tradition but I always attempt to follow it .,
This is the first year I'll be writing a review for my rereading because I realized I never did a proper one for the books .,
I think the reason is that I don't think I can find the words to describe just how much I love and adore this series .,

I think the reason is that I don't think I can find the words to describe just how much I love and adore this series .,
J.K. Rowling created a world that I can sink into, that I can immerse myself into at any point in my life .,
I grew up with Harry, I remember reading GoF when I was 14, knowing that I couldn't have done what Harry did even though we were the same age .,
I remember realizing I was 18, that eighteen year olds didn't attend Hogwarts anymore .,
As Harry grew, I grew .,
I grew as a person, I grew as a fan of this series .,
I went from standing in line to see GoF with my mom when I was 9 to repurchasing the entire set so that I would have copies in my first apartment .,
It's always a relief to remember that Harry, Ron, and Hermione have, and never will, change .,
They have stayed constant during my life .,
It may sound so cliche but Hogwarts, and these series, will always be there .,
They are one of my childhood homes that I can visit again and again with just a flip of the cover .,
It wasn't called this at all - but for some reason the title changed in the US and there is no original title versions of this on this site, which is also strange .,

We had just finished reading all the books of Dahl and were looking for something else to be getting on with - and there was this article in the paper saying that the Fundamentalist Christians wanted this book banned.Well, let's face it, there is no higher recommendation for a book and I remain grateful to the Christian community for pointing me in the right direction with this one.After the forth book my youngest daughter started reading them to me - there are few joys in life that are surpassed by books or daughters, mixing them together was always going to be a highlight, and how could it not be?These books got better as they went on - the last one was particularly good .,
There are no words I can think to write that can even come near to doing this book justice .,
This is a series that can only be savoured, like a top-dollar meal in a restaurant .,
There is only one way to appreciate it, and that is to just inhale every word of it.I had kept this on my mental shelf as a series that I would read one day, just not sure about the timeline .,
It got hurried along, but I don't regret it for even a single moment .,

I'm just in Hogwarts-heaven right now and lovin' it!;-)  .,
Having just read this for the first time, I definitely missed the boat .,
My taste in books now skews a little darker .,
At the same time, I'm glad I finally read it and though I don't think it was the best book of all time or anything, I can definitely understand the hype .,
I'm sure I'll eventually read all the books, in which case I'll understand the fandom and probably be a super fan myself .,
#MugglesReadAlong one book down!---This book is one of my favs in the series!The magic never withers and I'm always able to find/feel something different no matter how many times I've read it .,
A true classic!,
I'm a 22 year old woman and this is my first time ever reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .,
It was everything that people said it was going to be .,
The world is beyond magical .,
I feel like a got a better feel of the characters .,
Neville Longbottom is my fave!,
I can't!,
I love this series too much!,
Had a bad week so I decided to re read Harry Potter (this time in english) :D  .,
You don't like this series?,
Well, fuck off then .,
You and I are N-E-V-E-R going to get along .,
THIS WAS SO GOOD!!!,
Es war mal wieder so toll. .,
Ich liebe es  .,
Reread November 2014Obviously this isn't my first time reading Sorcerer's Stone; I think this is the 3rd reading for me .,
And as every time before, I loved it immensely .,
I really am just reminded of how incredible J.K. Rowling is at crafting a story, a whole world, and setting up the rest of the series, while still writing a smart, entertaining children's book .,
Because in reality, this first book is very young feeling, but it's never dumbed down .,

Because in reality, this first book is very young feeling, but it's never dumbed down .,
Since most people have read this or know the plot, I thought I would instead share some fun thoughts I had or noticed upon rereading this book:-What do you think the sorting hat said to Hermione, Ron, or any of the other characters when they tried it on?-Dumbledore's Chocolate Frog card mentions his defeat of Grindewald, a fact that doesn't come to be important until book 6 or 7!-The Weasley twins are hilarious as always, and they know the secret passages already (probably thanks to the Marauder's Map) that shows up in book 3.-I wonder why Hermione wasn't in Ravenclaw .,
(I'm sure there is some sort of answer for this one, I had just never thought of it before).-I want Mrs. Weasley to knit me a sweater.-The Mirror of Erised's inscription backwards says, "I show not your face but your heart's desire."-In the book, when Harry first finds the Mirror of Erised, he sees a reflection of his mom, dad, and the rest of his family .,
But in the film it only shows Lily and James .,
That would've been cool to see in the film.-Apparently, chess is the only thing that Hermione ever lost at (p.217) .,
If she is so smart, don't you think she'd be really good at the strategy of chess?-After seeing Quirrell/Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest, Harry starts to have nightmares about the face dripping unicorn blood .,
I wonder if this is Voldemort already using Occlumancy on Harry?-In the film, the protections that Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to get through to find the Sorcerer's Stone leave out the troll (placed by Quirrel) and the potions challenge (Snape's) .,
Would've been fun to see Hermione tackle that one.-Voldemort's face on the back of Quirrell's head is described as pale with red, slit eyes like a snake (like movie Voldemort) .,
Why isn't that how they portrayed him in the first film?!-Also, Neville's best exam grade was in Herbology .,
Aww .,
Overall, I just thought it was remarkable to note how many things Rowling references already!,
It makes me even more excited to jump right into Chamber of Secrets next!,

Y pensar que es super chico igual ajaja .,
Hermione es bastante infumable a veces, pero se nota que como amiga es excelente, amo sus ironU+00EDas y su sentido del humor, me encanta !!,
Ron es otro personaje que me gusta muchU+00EDsimo, es como un gran amigo fiel .,
Hagrid es como un padre con mentalidad de niU+00F1o ajajaj, me encanta, su personalidad, su sentido del humor, sus bromas, lo fiel que es, etc. Draco es el tU+00EDpico niU+00F1o malvado, que de vez en cuando se manda de las suyas, pero al final de todo, termina perdiendo!!,
Toma Draco, por gilipollas .,
Le di 5 estrellas porque en este libro se introduce todo lo que es el mundo mU+00E1gico de Hogwarts y de todo este mundo .,

This is Harry Potter .,
And this is his story.J.K .,
Rowling wrote a fantastic book .,
And this is not only a childrens book .,
This is an ALL-Age book .,
She wrote about a world which is magical and beauiful at the same time .,
She wrote about creatures and spells which people use today .,
I am still impressed by this author and her creativity .,
There is no book I could compare to Harry Potter.Without Harry Potter we wouldn't have Harry Potter.Especially the movies have a special place in my heart .,
Amazing!,
I'm still waiting for my letter. .,
I've read the same book in French at the end of 2015, but I wanted to read the whole series in English to discover JK Rowling's real writing .,
I'm not disappointed at all, I'm still in love with this book !,
I'm gonna discover the next books now, because I haven't read them before.Harry Potter will always be a wonderful series, even after all these years that have gone by .,
Auch auf englisch ist der erste Teil von Harry Potter einfach nur toll .,
Ich liebe die Welt, die J. K. Rowling erschaffen hat .,
Die Protagonisten, ob gut oder bU+00F6se, sind genial und einmalig .,
Eine Reihe, die ich jedes Jahr wieder lesen kann und muss .,
I think I don't have to say anything except that I would give this book 1000000000/5 stars if I could .,
5 MAGICAL STARS .,
Ob-vious-ly..Jim Dale's narration is perfection, cannot WAIT to listen to Chamber of Secrets!!,
c'mon, it's Harry Potter, whadya think-  .,
All the Illustrations in this Book are amazing!!!,

I got to enjoy the story like it was meant to be enjoyed so I know more than a few of you Potter fans wish you were me right now and got to fall in love with this series for the first time.What can I say?,
While reading this, I felt simultaneously transported back in time and into another world.The world was filled with magic and mythical creatures and the time was when I was eleven years old and filled with imagination and wonder .,
I've read my fair share of children's books, but I've never read one that so perfectly captured the feeling of how wonderful and freeing it is to be a child .,
I loved the moments when Harry, Ron, and Hermoine got to play, eat sweets, and find mischief like normal kids just as much as I liked the moments when they were learning magic and fighting monsters .,
Even the most mundane activities were written in such a wistful and intriguing way that I was afraid to miss a single word .,
Usually if I my eyes glaze over I just keep reading until I get caught up but that was impossible to do with this book .,
I was scared that if I looked away for even a moment I might miss something .,
When the story began, I hated the Dursleys with such a passion .,
A group of more miserable and hateful people has never been found .,
After a while, I had to remind myself to chill out because things were going to get better for Harry eventually .,
And that's the only way I made it though those first chapters without throwing my book across the room .,
But something happened when Harry met Ron's mom for the first time .,
I was so relieved when she was sweet and motherly towards him that I realized why the Dursleys had to be so terrible .,
There are plenty of mean and horrible people Harry has to deal with, but those bad people make the friends Harry meets seem all the more wonderful .,
After I realized how necessary the villains were to the story, I started to enjoy them more .,
When Harry and the gang got in trouble, instead of just feeling dread and worrying about them, I also looked forward to seeing how they were going to get out of their current scrape .,
There was a chemistry between all the characters in this book that was such a pleasure .,
Harry is an innocent and heroic little boy who is lucky to have a loyal and brave friend like Ron, and Hermione is the smart, mother hen .,
She worries about them both, tells them when their ideas are stupid, and then goes along to keep them out of trouble .,
And Dumbledore is insanely funny it only took two scenes for me to fall in love with him and wish he was my crazy great-uncle .,
I honestly can't think of a thing I didn't love about this book .,
I even loved the names!,
(Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington is the best name in the history of names, and I will never refer to him as U+201CHeadless NickU+201D.) Everything was so well thought out and planned, and there were more than a few surprising moments that I never saw coming .,
I am so glad that I waited as long as I did to read this .,
I have always liked to read, but when I was a kid, I didn't love it the way I do now .,
I finally know why everyone loves this book so much .,
It's not because it is the greatest piece of literature that has ever been written, It's because this book shows how joyful and fun reading can be .,
Reading doesn't have to be intimidated and hard to be good .,
The best books--the books that stick with you and make you smile when you think about them--are the ones that challenge you, teach you something useful, and entertain the heck out of you .,
This book did all that and more .,
This is the first book I have every read that I can honestly recommend everyone read .,
I'm not even sure how to do the parental guidance on this one .,
I recommend the parent read it first and then decide if their child can handle it .,
At the very least, the parent will have some fun.This review was originally posted on Kookie Krysp Reads  .,
**5/5 Stars but I wish I could give it about 9 3/4 out of 5!,
hehe .,
It's so wonderful!,
I gotta be honest, I missed the Harry Potter train whenever I was a wee tyke .,
I had never seen the movies or read the books until last year whenever my grandmom gave me and my sister the whole movie collection and told us we had to watch them because they're, "simply amazing," as she said .,
:) So, last year, me and my sister sat down and watched all of the movies, in order .,

:) So, last year, me and my sister sat down and watched all of the movies, in order .,
I was absolutely amazed at how great the storyline really is, how wonderful all of the characters are and ultimately, how MAGICAL it really is .,
This past summer, my family and I went on our annual trip to Anaheim, California .,
We always go to Disneyland, Huntington Beach, and Universal Studios .,
I was really excited to hear that Universal Studios had a new "Diagon Alley," area that was supposed to be as "magical" as the Harry Potter movies .,
Let's just say, I was in absolute wonder .,
We spent almost our entire day in Diagon Alley, we only had time to ride two other rides in the whole park before closing time because we stayed there that late .,
I was amazed by how magical it all was .,
The shops, the food, the wands, the tricks, the staff, the rides, everything was completely and utterly themed for Harry Potter and I honestly felt like I was in Diagon Alley and Hogsmead .,
It was INCREDIBLE .,
So, while we were there, I decided that I HAD TO read the books .,
I wanted more of this wizarding world, I wanted to know more about the characters and everything that surrounds this world .,
So, we came home, I got on e-bay, found a brand new set of the special edition books that have spines make the castle and I bought them!,
As soon as they came in, I couldn't wait to start reading them .,
Becuase of school (I'm triple majoring in Nursing, English and Business) and because of the time I have to work (preceptorship hours for my BSN in Nursing) I haven't had near as much time to read .,
It's been difficult but I finally got caught up enough in school and finished the books that I was reading over this summer where I could start this book .,
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone!,
The first book in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter books .,
I must say that I was not disappointed at all .,
In fact, I'm even more in love with the world of Harry Potter and these characters that the INCREDIBLE J.K. Rowling has created .,
It's such a lovely book that explores being different, outcasted, standing up for what's right, being afraid and brave at the same time, and never losing your curiosity .,
It's such an amazing book .,
I'm so excited that I've finally got to start reading these lovely books and I can't wait to continue on!,
:) 5/5 Stars but I wish I could give it about 9 3/4 out of 5!,
hehe .,
It's so wonderful!,
Thank you, J.K. Rowling, for writing these books and creating this world .,
I believe you're never too old to discover the magic in this world and become a part of it .,
This is just excellent!,
:) xo, Rachel  .,
I can't rate Harry Potter any more than I can rate hot chocolate or weekends or the feeling of being nuzzled by a puppy .,
But I can say that the experience of reading this book now, when I'm older than Lily and James were when they had their son, was very different from the experience of reading it for the first time when I was younger than Harry .,
Before I had ever seriously said goodbye to anyone, I thought that the first chapter was comical .,

But I can say that the experience of reading this book now, when I'm older than Lily and James were when they had their son, was very different from the experience of reading it for the first time when I was younger than Harry .,
Before I had ever seriously said goodbye to anyone, I thought that the first chapter was comical .,
Now, it's a struggle not to cry alongside Hagrid, McGonagall, and Dumbledore .,
I used to immerse myself in the wizarding world without thinking too much about it .,
Now, I'm fascinated by how JKR's writing choices make that immersion possible .,
Magical cultures, histories, and economies are hinted at in a way that resembles how we usually interact with their real-life counterparts, rather than being explained through info-dumps that forcefully remind us that we're being introduced to a fictional world.I used to look up to Harry, thinking of him as a practically grown-up hero .,
Now, I'm struck by his social astuteness and his lack of pretension - I loved seeing him figure out how to share with Ron without making Ron feel embarrassed, as well as his matter-of-fact acceptance of Quirrell's speech impediment .,
I was also surprised at how manipulative he is under certain circumstances - he would indeed have done well in Slytherin .,
Mostly, I just wish I could hug him and Hedwig and the others, and protect them from the terrible things in the not-too-distant future .,
And yet, I think their willingness to confront the future is part of what makes them so lovable .,
In some ways, I still look up to them .,
Finally, this reading experience created a bridge to the version of myself that opened the book over 15 years ago .,
In the time since then, we've been inundated with other people's (mostly filmmakers') ideas of what Harry's world looks and sounds like .,
It took a bit of conscious effort, but by displacing those images I rediscovered the world that my own imagination once created - part of it modeled after people and places in my own life at the time, part of it purely invented and then seemingly forgotten, but just waiting to be brought back to life .,

Getting that invite to Hogwarts must be such fun - IU+2019m sure many normals in this world fantasize it happening to them at that age.Harry Potter is likeable, but simple .,
His friends are the same .,
The villain promises to be a fascinating one but heU+2019s not really uncovered yet save for whispers of legends and foreshadowing .,
The book was especially enjoyable at the beginning, where Harry is unfortunate in his demented average family .,
ThereU+2019s humor that works, sometimes, pushing the story along .,
The real excitement starts when Harry steps foot onto Hogwarts ground, meeting the bizarre blend of professors, other students, potions, classes, and challenges.I know the movie was rated poorly by some in comparison to the book .,
To me itU+2019s almost word for word, including dialogue .,
Some of it, such as emotion, worked better in page form .,
I do have to prefer some of the movie though, especially when playing Quidditch, because the effects made it more interesting .,
I think Rowling drug it out too long in book form, and because of this dragging on I grew a little bored at times.Overall a cute and quirky, simple novel that opens a door to a world that skyrocketed .,
IU+2019m hoping I enjoy the later novels more, just like I did with the movies .,

I loved the entire book and breezed through it .,
It left my mind amazed and bewildered .,
I have watched the films countless of times and now I SEE THE MISSING PORTIONS that are so relevant to the plot .,
The book makes everything much more clear and I loved the casting of spells and the sorting hat where Harry was sorted into Gryffindor!,
Will definitely be reading this series throughout this year and I can't wait .,

I started Harry Potter late, and I kept telling myself better late than never .,
Yes, that does work to an extent .,
And then I think of my younger version, reading all the crap our school teachers used to give us .,
And then I think how much fun would have been to read Harry Potter at that age .,
Why didn't anyone tell me about the book back then?,
Why didn't my parents buy it for my birthday?,
Or Christmas?,

Well, almost everything .,
So mum, if you're reading this, shame on you!,
You took away from me the privilege of growing up with Harry Potter .,
That is a crime!,
A crime I say!But seriously you guys, Harry Potter is epic!,
I canU+2019t wait to get my hands on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .,
Naturally this was a phenomenal because it's Harry Potter and I have always loved these books since I first read them, but this edition is the brand new illustrated edition and I have to say that Jim Kay was BY FAR a wonderful choice to illustrate these because he's represented the wonder, quirk and magic of the world and characters beautifully!,
I had so many pages within this that I adored, the colour palette is beautiful and has such a great vibe, and the style is free, flowing and fabulous.ThNaturally this was a phenomenal because it's Harry Potter and I have always loved these books since I first read them, but this edition is the brand new illustrated edition and I have to say that Jim Kay was BY FAR a wonderful choice to illustrate these because he's represented the wonder, quirk and magic of the world and characters beautifully!,

5*s of course (although Harry Potter defies all rating systems)  .,
Que saudades que tinha deste mundo!,
Depois de ler o mais recente livro de Harry Potter, deu-me uma vontade imensa de voltar a reler esta saga, que marcou a minha infU+00E2ncia e adolescU+00EAncia!,
E assim comeU+00E7ou a re-leitura.Como nunca escrevi nenhuma opiniU+00E3o dos 7 livros de Harry Potter, no blogue, vou fazU+00EA-lo agora U+00E0 medida que for relendo os livros!,
por isso, podem contar com uma opiniU+00E3o em breve ;)OpiniU+00E3o aqui: https://thegirlwhoreadssbooks.wordpre..Agora .,
Vou ver o filme hehe  .,
TU+00E1 liberado chorar de saudade?HU+00E1 tanto tempo que eu nU+00E3o mergulhava nessa histU+00F3ria que foi quase como se eu tivesse lendo pela primeira vez novamente .,
Quase .,
Ver os personagens tU+00E3o novos e tU+00E3o corajosos, me impressionar com os perigos que eles jU+00E1 se colocavam. .,
O mais legal de reler o livro foi que eu estava com muitos detalhes do filme na cabeU+00E7a, entU+00E3o vU+00E1rias coisas eu nU+00E3o lembrava que havia acontecido .,
Como eu disse, foi quase como ler pela primeira vez .,
Nostalgia total .,
I read it late, but still I can see how this book became so popular .,
It has everything a child needs: adventure, mystery, magic and it's well written .,
Maybe when I'll have time I'll read the rest of the books in the series .,
I did it backwards .,
I began with the movies and now I finished my first book!,
I loved every word of it!,
Up to the next .,
Re-reading "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone" always feels like coming home  .,
The hype of Harry Potter passed me by when I was small, so itU+2019s only now (at age nineteen) that I borrowed the famed (and very tattered) novel from the library and immersed myself in the world of Hogwarts .,
It was strictly for U+201CresearchU+201D, okay?,
I canU+2019t call myself a childrenU+2019s author and yet have skipped the most impacting and controversial childrenU+2019s novel of all time .,
So first of all, I loved it .,
IU+2019m not fan of the U+201CclassicsU+201D style, but the clean prose of Harry Potter and the PhilosopherU+2019s StonThe hype of Harry Potter passed me by when I was small, so itU+2019s only now (at age nineteen) that I borrowed the famed (and very tattered) novel from the library and immersed myself in the world of Hogwarts .,

So first of all, I loved it .,
IU+2019m not fan of the U+201CclassicsU+201D style, but the clean prose of Harry Potter and the PhilosopherU+2019s Stone, the quirky description and the subtle humour could very well convert me .,
ItU+2019s written in omnipresent narrative, again, not my U+201CthingU+201D U+2013 with POV everywhere and by anyone .,
Once Harry turned eleven, we delved more into his viewing of the world, but at the beginning, we see out of everyoneU+2019 eyes .,
Even that catU+2019s .,
The character?,
Oh, the characters!,
My personal taste requires a book to be well written and have gripping characters .,
(Everything else is open for negotiation.) I loved Hagrid!,
And Dumbledore .,
And Snape (urgh) .,
And Harry!,
Ron and the Weasley twins were instant favourites of course (the latterU+2019s antics keeping me smiling the whole way through) .,
But, IU+2019ll go right ahead and say that Hermoine is my utter favourite .,
I loved her from the beginning and every aspect of her character was so well written, not to mention hilariously brought across .,
Ron and HarryU+2019s understandable disgust of her is epic .,
The only character I said, U+201CMehU+201D, at was Voldemort .,
He had so much hype around him from chapter one that I didnU+2019t think he could possibly be that scary .,
He wasnU+2019t .,
Any villain who doesnU+2019t kill his victims straight away is going to end up defeated U+2013 probably by a preteen and his little gang of snivelly nosed adventure-seekers .,
Being over ten years old, the style of childrenU+2019s books as changed since Harry Potter first hit the shelves .,
Does that affect this novel?,
No!,
It stands in a classy light of itU+2019s own .,
It canU+2019t be accused of being U+201CclichU+00E9 U+201D, because it started everything!,
ItU+2019s well written and well plotted and I think my only complaint is Harry having to spend his summer holidays back with the Dursely family .,
As to the controversial aspect?,
Witchcraft?,
Wizardry?,
Is JK Rowling promoting children to immerse themselves in the occult?,
Should we be scared of this book and ban and burn it?,
Well, apart from my personal conviction that a book should never be burned, I canU+2019t see much difference to reading about dragons and fairies, to frolicking through HarryU+2019s adventures in Hogwarts .,
JK Rowling presents a side for evil and a side for good .,
It can be argued, how is magic ever good?,
And it can also be argued, is there such a thing as magic?,
(Or fairies, for that matter!,
And I still believe in them!) Harry Potter is a fairy tale .,
Take it or leave it at that .,
If I had a small child (which I donU+2019t, beingU+2026well, a teen and all) I would probably not let them read Harry Potter until they were ten or so .,
Then we could discuss it .,
It is an epic classic, still standing after decades, and still inspiring children to imagine, have adventures, and write .,
Or find their letter to Hogwarts .,
That option might outweigh the others .,
I highly doubted that I would ever write a review for any of the Harry Potter books .,
Instead, I created a shelf called "seven greatest books ever" and threw them all in there, hoping that would be enough to display my immense love for them .,
After seeing Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows movie, I decided that I would kick start the re-reading process before the release of Part 2, so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for probably the 15th time, and began to read .,

After seeing Part 1 of the Deathly Hallows movie, I decided that I would kick start the re-reading process before the release of Part 2, so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone for probably the 15th time, and began to read .,
I realized part way through, that even if I didn't want to review it for its literary merit, I still had much to say about the book solely regarding how it makes me feel.At twenty three years of age, the book is still everything that it was for me when I was only twelve .,
I remember seeing it in a book order (remember those?) in the sixth grade and putting a star next to it to take home to my mom .,
My mom, not wanting to buy me a book I'd never read, denied me my request, adding that it looked pretty silly anyway (the joke was on her though, she came to love them too) .,
Anyway, the next year, my cool uncle (don't we all have one?) decided he was going to buy them for my cousin and she was going to have to let me borrow them .,
So I began the Harry Potter books, and suddenly being twelve- awkward and unpopular, wasn't quite so lonely as it had always been .,
I dreamed myself right into Harry Potter's world; not in a dangerous, psychotic way, but in a starry eyed, childlike way .,
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were better friends to me than anyone I met throughout my junior high and high school years, which in a way is a bit sad, but I have no regrets.This was the first time that I've read Sorcerer's Stone since Deathly Hallows came out, and it inevitably made for a far more emotional experience than the first time around .,
What was once just good, innocent, fun can't exactly be viewed as such when you've seen the big picture .,
I literally burst into tears at the end of the chapter in which Harry and Ron finally take Hermione as their friend .,
Oh, what the heck?,
I'll go ahead and post the paragraph, in case anyone else is wanting to ride the high of that emotional wave:But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend .,
There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them .,
Knowing what they were in store for- years of utter devotion to one another made this moment so much bigger now than it had seemed at first .,
Either way though, it's a very moving moment .,
I love this book .,
I will always love this book .,
And I full intend to disown any future children of mine who can't appreciate it with me (I haven't decided as to whether or not that's a joke yet) .,
I was expecting my return trip to Hogwarts to be something of a dampener .,
I had finished the series and after all, how many more surprises could the first book reveal?,
The magic must have faded over time and the characters must surely have achieved the status of house-guests who had overstayed their welcome .,
Predictably enough, I was wrong .,
Returning to the first book in what I can now proudly say is my most favourite series EVER was nothing short of magical .,

Predictably enough, I was wrong .,
Returning to the first book in what I can now proudly say is my most favourite series EVER was nothing short of magical .,
It was enchanting to see how the complex and multifaceted characters of the later books started off as nervous, unsure ickle-firsties .,
It was a time for firsts: a) Ill-treated, neglected 11-year old orphan Harry Potter discovers that he is a wizard - an actual, honest-to-goodness, wand-swishing wizard.b) There is a magical school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards like him and at Hogwarts, Harry Potter is a legend and so much more than a small boy who lives in a cupboard under the stairs.b) He discovers that he had brave parents who loved him dearly and lost their lives to the most powerful dark wizard in existence in a misguided attempt to save their tiny son.c) It will be the first time that he will meet his soon-to-be best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, not knowing that it would be the start of many unforeseen and memorable adventures for the trio.For me, the charm lay in reacquainting myself with my favourite cast of characters: the great and twinkly-eyed Headmaster Albus Dumbledore, stern Prof. McGonagall with a staunchly hidden soft-center, quivering Neville Longbottom who is brave enough to stand up to his friends, nasty Draco Malfoy, lovable Hagrid, the irrepressible Fred and George and of course, delightfully detestable Severus Snape .,
I also liked the fact that J.K.Rowling carved out a story that was a blend of fantasy and realism .,
She refused to patronize her young readers .,
She spoke about death in a manner that doesn't usually finds it's way into a children's book .,
With minimal sugar-coating, she created a world that was rife with pain, loss and love.In this book, Harry Potter faces his vile enemy for the very first time with nerve and bravery .,
He gets his first opportunity to prove that he is more than just a legendary kid with a mysterious past.The book sets an adequate pace, lays the foundation for future awesomeness and needless to say..the rest is history .,
I'm just going to be honest here: It is impossible for me to write an unbiased review of Harry Potter.I know Harry Potter has it's flaws, I know J.K. Rowling makes mistakes .,

and I honestly couldn't care less.I grew up with Harry, and it will always be my favourite book series .,
No matter if I'm happy or sad, I will always pick it up again eventually .,
So, now that you've been warned, let's review thiI'm just going to be honest here: It is impossible for me to write an unbiased review of Harry Potter.I know Harry Potter has it's flaws, I know J.K. Rowling makes mistakes .,

and I honestly couldn't care less.I grew up with Harry, and it will always be my favourite book series .,
No matter if I'm happy or sad, I will always pick it up again eventually .,
So, now that you've been warned, let's review this book (or, rather: this edition) The StoryI don't really need to go into much detail, I think everyone knows what the first book is about: Harry's first year at Hogwarts and his first encounter with Voldemort and magic .,
I love Rowling's writing and the pace of the plot .,
There really is not a single dull page in this one .,
The EditionI wanted to re-read Philosopher's Stone for a while now, but with all the TBR books in my shelf, I never really allowed myself to .,
So I was more than happy when I got this beautiful book for christmas .,
I don't need to tell you that the illustration in this are amazing, because if you took one look at the cover you know that Jim Kay can draw .,
Now, what might be more interesting: Is it worth buying?For every Potterhead: YES DEFINITELYFor everyone that just liked Harry Potter: Mhh, if you own a copy of the normal edition, it might not be necessary to buy this one, because the text inside is exactly the same, the only bonus are the illustrations .,
Even if you don't already own a copy, I don't know if it would be wise to buy this, because this book really is huge .,
Alas, hard to transport .,
No taking this book to work or school to read during break .,
But: If you don't plan to bring it with you wherever you go, why not?,
For me, this book is definitely worth the money and if I ever were to have kids, this is the book I'm going to read them .,
This is the book that made me love reading .,
When I was younger I used to hate reading .,
I couldn't do it and I had no interest in learning it, but I could memorize .,
So in kindergarten reading groups that was exactly what I did .,
I memorized .,
I memorized the reading group books and passed through them all without ever learning how to read .,
It was my first grade teacher that figured me out and spent four weeks teaching me to read .,
I owe a lot to that woman .,
Still, I didn't really like to do it .,

Still, I didn't really like to do it .,
It wasn't until second or third grade my mom brought this home and handed it to me and told me to give it a shot .,
Chapter one I handed it back and said I didn't like it, she handed it back and told me to try again .,
Rinse and repeat for a few chapters until something amazing happened .,
I didn't want to give the book back .,
I didn't want to put it down to go eat dinner and I certainly didn't want to put it down and go to bed .,
I stayed up until I was falling asleep on the pages and then I took it to school and started my bad habit of reading in class .,
Then I read through lunch and recess and silent reading time until I finished this book .,
I devoured all the others when I could get my hands on them but between Harry Potter books I didn't know what to do with myself .,
So my parents did a little digging around and found me another book I liked and then another and another until I became the family bookworm .,
I started borrowing books from my older sister, I started reading books to my younger brother, I read just about everything and anything I could find and I loved every minute of it .,
It's really hard to rate a book that I grew up on, but if any book deserves five stars, it's this one because it helped turn me into the person I am .,
The series itself got me through a lot of hard times and I love going back to it and re-reading it because it feels like coming home .,

Hello, Harry .,
We meet again .,
It seems we got off on the wrong foot the last time.It took me more than ten years to read this book for the second time .,
A full review, and a full explanation of my experience with this series, to come.Rating and some words on the actual quality of the book and series will come later as I progress through the sequels .,
Other than that, I will mostly focus on my own personal thoughts .,
Why have I not read Harry Potter before now, itU+2019s totally amazing!,
From the first page till the last one I was hooked .,
I always thought I wouldnU+2019t enjoy a book about a wizard boy who is 11U+2026but damn I was so wrong!,
Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are probably the best characters ever .,
They are smart, loyal, brave, funny, and so much more; you canU+2019t help but love them .,
Honestly, I canU+2019t wait till I get started with the rest of the series .,

No question that I would be giving this story 5 stars .,
I can't believe it has been 19 years since I've last read this novel .,
I absolutely adored it even after all these years .,
By far my favorite series ever written .,
I look forward to re-reading the other books in the series throughout the year .,
This is never gonna be less than 5 stars, no matter how many times we read it .,
The squealing & excitement for the whole last chapter was greater than ever .,
Neville getting his points is pretty much everyone's favorite.Reading is truly like getting together with old friends .,
Magical ones at that .,
Anyone heard of this?,
It's not bad!,
It's about a kid who goes to school..no really, it's more interesting than it sounds!,

Wow this was amazing .,
I loved it so much .,
Especially with all the magic and the adventures!!!,
I need the next book now :o  .,
I've been putting off to start this series for so long, and I have no idea why .,
It was just as amazing as I expected.Can't wait to continue with it .,
There's no doubt in my heart that I'll keep rereading this book 'till the day I die .,
The illustrations only adds to the magic .,

Harry Potter is a Mary Sue, Gary Stu, Marty Stu, whatever you want to call him .,
Let me say it again.HARRY POTTER IS A SUE.No wonder it was boring and bothering me so much .,
I can hear you future readers (at present I have exactly none) demanding to know why, just why, I think he is a Sue, and how dare I?,
Those of you who havenU+2019t fainted, that is.*puts on mafia boss accent* You wanna know why?,
Let me count the ways .,
If you could just keep track on your fingersU+2013oh, it looks like youU+2019ll need your toes as wellU+2013that would be really helpful.Right .,
Here we go.1 .,
HeU+2019s hated by all the nasty (some of them ridiculously evil) people.2 .,
And liked by all the good ones.3 .,
He has a cool scar, black hair, and green eyes .,
Like, yeah .,
He looks cool .,
This is the reason I stay away from the black hair/green eyes combo in my own writing: itU+2019s really something that gets doled out by most authors to their specialest favouritest characters .,
And boy, is Harry Potter special or what?4 .,
HeU+2019s famous .,
Not only that, but everyone bows to him in the street .,
I think we just discovered BuddhaU+2019s successor.5 .,
HeU+2019s rich .,
Insanely rich .,
What are the odds?6 .,
He got into the best school for magic around .,
Without even applying.7 .,
HeU+2019s a Gryffindor, the most fantabulous house in the school.8 .,
HeU+2019s fantastic at broomsticking even though heU+2019s never had any practice whatsoever.9 .,
Immediately, instead of getting punished for breaking the rules, he gets put on the Quidditch team even though itU+2019s unheard of for someone so young to be there .,
And this is after the teacher sees one single display of catching a Remembrall .,
Ever heard of beginnersU+2019 luck?,
Adrenaline-fuelled ability, perhaps?,
Heightened senses?,
With all this, she still decides that Harry should be in the Quidditch team.10 .,
Continuing the theme of complete and utter Sueness: FREE BROOMSTICK!,
Not only that, itU+2019s the latest in broomstick technology.11 .,
He got given his broomstick by a teacher .,
I will leave you to guess the phrase that applies here .,
Starts with U+2018tU+2019 and ends with U+2018eacherU+2019s petU+2019 .,
Wow .,
You got it .,
Tell me, have you applied for Mensa yet?12 .,
He then impresses everybody on the Quidditch team with his special specialness to such an extent that heU+2019s likened to the greatest Quidditch player in a hundred years (who was also definitely older than Harry when he played Quidditch).13 .,
Invisible cloak .,
HeU+2019s got all this, and then to add to it, he gets an invisible cloak.14 .,
HeU+2019s smart.15 .,
HeU+2019s brave.16 .,
HeU+2019s good at magic .,
These last three combined are a Sueness Overload in themselves.17 .,
And yet, even with all these qualities, heU+2019s so generous and brave, is purported to have such good judgement, etc., that you feel as if the urge to like him is being shoved down your throat, stirred until properly combined, and left to set for three hours.18 .,
This is the part that made me almost throw up: Hermione, for no good reason, throws her arms around Harry and tells him how great he is, and that sheU+2019s basically not worth half of what he is .,
Just stuff some more Sueness down our throats, why donU+2019t you, J?19 .,
Harry just escaped major Sue-ity again because Neville LongbottomU+2019s final points are the ones that win Gryffindor the House Cup/Trophy/thing .,
Still, Ron and Hermione win a generic fifty points each .,
Harry, of course, has to get sixty .,
Minor Sue-ness.20 .,
Yeah, he loses Gryffindor a massive 150 points, but he gets it all back, doesnU+2019t he?,
Being treated like an outcast doesnU+2019t really seem to have made an impression on him at all.21 .,
Instead of being punished for heading into the third-floor corridor, he is rewarded .,
Now, make no mistake, I do see that there are times when we should break the rules for the right reasons .,
But surely, to maintain order, shouldnU+2019t the U+2018perpetratorsU+2019 be punished on the surface of things?,
Surely Harry should be given grunt work or detention or something, right?,
Wrong.22 .,
The way he was saved from the evil Lord Voldemort is by nothing other than Pure Love .,
*cue sparkles*23 .,
Dumbledore turns out to have given Harry the cloak .,
Surely, having been a teacher for many years, he would recognise what mischief kids get up to, and would really NOT want a boy whose friends include the brother of Fred and George Weasley to have access to an invisible cloak .,
Or, if it comes to that, any kid at all .,
T-E-A-C-H-E-R-S-P-E-T.I wouldnU+2019t care if HP only displayed a couple of these characteristics, but heU+2019s got the whole lot!,
The thing that really drives me up the wall is that surely this should be the ultimate guide for what not to do when writing a book, and yetU+2026 and yetU+2026 itU+2019s a bestseller .,
ItU+2019s not sour grapes that keep me writing this post .,
ItU+2019s sheer confuzzled amazement.The writing style is boring and forgettable .,
No description to speak of, no real thoughts .,
There are some allusions to historical figures and terms, and so on, but they arenU+2019t presented in an interesting way .,
And couldnU+2019t we have at least met Nicholas Flamel?The morals in Harry Potter and the PhilosopherU+2019s Stone are negligible at best .,
ItU+2019s just me, me, me propaganda in disguiseU+2014one lying, sneaking, and even U+2018immobilisingU+2019 episode after another .,
And thatU+2019s from the so-called U+2018goodU+2019 characters.ClichU+00E9 after clichU+00E9 abounds in this book .,
ItU+2019s there in DumbledoreU+2019s white beard .,
ItU+2019s there in HarryU+2019s surprisingly quick Quidditch triumph .,
ItU+2019s there in Professor QuirrelU+2019s turban .,
And most of all, itU+2019s there in Draco Malfoy, a character so flat he couldU+2019ve been made out of paper and then run over with a steamroller and his original shape would have been slightly rounder.Added to which, the plot is so unoriginal .,
Can anyone say U+2018CinderellaU+2019?,
Orphaned child mysteriously left with a mean, boring family who doesnU+2019t want him and treats him terribly .,
Discovers that he really belongs to a world beyond his wildest dreams .,
And that heU+2019s very, very rich .,
Almost immediately, heU+2019s at home there .,
Sure, he has his enemies, but who doesnU+2019t?,
And they get dealt with anyway .,
Added to which, it turns out that his parents are super-cool.If thatU+2019s original, then IU+2019m Neville LongbottomU+2019s true love .,
Turns out everybody who keeps calling this original is Neville's honeybunchkins.I had to struggle to finish this book .,
Really struggle .,
I had it out from the library for nine weeks because I kept putting it down for ten days or so, then realizing I should probably finish it to see if it got better .,
IU+2019d pick it up and realise that IU+2019d forgotten what had happened before, meaning I had to go back to the beginning and start all over again .,
This, as you may well imagine, drove me nuts.Eventually, with the help of SparkNotes, I managed to figure it out and IU+2019ve just taken book 2 out of the library .,
IU+2019m wondering if it gets any better .,
After all, J.K. RowlingU+2019s run out of Cinderella storyline .,
Considering how much people love this series (to me at this point in time, they are inexplicably popular), IU+2019m not going to end with a pessimistic U+201CI donU+2019t think soU+201D .,
I might go with something more like this:ItU+2019s got to, right?,
Right---------*Disclaimer: As I am not at this point in time a Harry Potter fan, IU+2019ve probably gotten a couple of things wrong, although IU+2019ve checked and double-checked to the best of my ability .,
(If you see any errors, please comment and let me know.) However, even if a few things are a bit off, there are still about twenty points on this list .,
Surely thatU+2019s enough to merit consideration anyway .,

Friendship, Loyalty, Judgmental attitude, everything is somehow squeezed into it.The HP world: I've always felt that some of the best books are those which don't describe a lot and manage to tickle your imaginary bones .,
Yes, a lot of things have been minutely described, the look of the characters, some of the Hogwarts rooms, but there is a lot left out which somehow you piece together yourself, like Jenga, you know there are some missing pieces and you can picture the tower in its entirety if you want to!Characters: Even Hedwig seemed to have a personality of its own!,
And can we have some more Draco please?,
I loved the trio (I think they are called the golden trio?) Hermoine was so cute but I would stay so far away from such girls in school (because, you know, I so want to be Slytherin!) I couldn't help but relate a few of my school friends to Ron .,
Harry's character was a bit calm and I expect him to come out of his cave in the next book .,
The faculty was so intriguing, and now I know why Snape is so talked about .,
And shoutout to the Big Friendly Giant, Hagrid!Pace: I didn't really care about it .,
I'm not even sure if the book was fast or slow .,
It was well put together and something or the other was constantly happening .,

I am 18 yrs late to this party and to make a review on this book in 2016 is probably silly .,
This was published few years after I was born and gotten its hype in the early 2000s, well based on where I'm from, Philippines .,
My cousins were so utterly obsessed on the films (apparently they're not into books, only me and my uncle loves to read) and they would watch HP films over and over again .,
I lost count on how many times they've watched it in our family room, every time they'd get .,

I lost count on how many times they've watched it in our family room, every time they'd get .,
Back then I think they're crazy .,
The wizard world just did not interest me .,
I was into something only grown-ups were allowed to read .,
But I still did since I was fff excited to grow-up only to find out adulting is never fun at all .,
Also, what I was reading back then were works of Sidney Sheldon, and all those other crime-mystery novels I could easily get off of our shelf.Then there came the regret .,
*cringe*Not reading HP when I should have, years ago, was my choice .,
I guess the hype was to blame since everyone was talking about HP left and right and since I was a rebel, I did not gave-in .,
I also did not watched the films although we have all the CDs back home .,
I didn't know what I was getting myself into but what I now know was, although I've missed so much on enjoying this magical series when I was younger, I could still catch-up on it and experience it all, and feel like I'm a kid again .,
As cliche as it may sound, it never is too late for Hogwarts.I may have lost those years, but Harry Potter will always be there to bring me to a world where good triumphs evil, where friendship is true and gold, where everything is possible, and where Magic does exists .,
The illustrations in this book are stunning, and re-reading it with the images alongside the text for the first time brings a whole new experience .,
The perfect illustrator was chosen too in my opinion, with the artwork an excellent combination of cute, creepy, and magical .,
Cannot wait for the next books to all be released in this edition!,
This is less a review, and more a sort of miniature memoir of my Harry Potter experience .,
Gushy emotions and etc follow, so feel free to skip this review with no more than my recommendation that if you have not read this series you should do so immediately.Every so often when I'm sick in bed; a little depressed; or just generally cold and want nothing more than to snuggle up with blankets and forget the world for a few days, I go on a Harry Potter marathon .,

I read every single one of the books - in order - over the course of around two days (I've read them so often that I can devour them in almost a single go now) followed by as many of the films as I can fit into the time I have left, before I'm forced back into reality .,
I am one of the Harry Potter generation .,
I was four when this first book was published, fourteen when the series concluded, and around the same age as the characters in the films when they eventually came out .,
I still remember my mother insisting that I was too young to read this (at the age of 5) and hiding it under the sofa cushions so I could read in secret anyway.It's a series that I grew up with, and as such, cannot comment on its literary merits without bias .,
All I know is that these books are a comfort, and feel almost like family .,
They may not technically be the best books I have ever read, but for a reading experience they are truly unparalleled.30 Day Book Challenge, Day 3: Favourite series .,
(It has to be, there is no other series of books I've read this many times, and will read again another hundred .,
I can (and sometimes do) read the entire series in three days or less now, as I am so familiar with the words I can simply slip through them for the comfort of the story..)  .,
Oh go to hell .,
These things are like crack.So I just finished the 7th one and I have no intention of re-reading them, though I do have fond memories of them .,
My most recent encounter with Harry Potter was on an airplane a couple of days ago .,
This humongous 16 year old kid from North Dakota was sitting next to me reading the 5th book .,
He smelled like cereal and farts and was audibly mouth-breathing for the whole flight .,
I tried to engage him in conversation periodically to get his little whistleOh go to hell .,

He smelled like cereal and farts and was audibly mouth-breathing for the whole flight .,
I tried to engage him in conversation periodically to get his little whistle to quiet down for a few minutes at a time .,
We chatted about the little bastards at Hogrwarts and it kind of got me misty..not for the books, but for how terrible high school was even though I didn't realize it at the time .,
And this kid clearly didn't either .,
He just wanted to read his book and make it home .,
I wanted to tell him that in 10 years he wouldn't even remember what his goddamn school looked like .,
Instead I tried to convince him that what he heard about Dumbledore dying in the 6th one wasn't true .,
Stay strong, brother .,
Reread: December 7, 2015 This time I used an audiobook narrated by stephen fry and although I found some voices weird, I like most of it and will continue listening to it until I finish all of the 7 books!,

I was enthralled .,
When I turned nine, I noticed that many of my classmates were carrying around these huge books, so I decided to pick up Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone .,
I can honestly say it changed my life .,
Before HP I did like to read, but it wasn't really all that big of a deal to me .,
When I finished the first Harry Potter book, it was like a spell was cast on me (hehe) .,
I went out and got the rest of the books immediately and I flew through each one .,
When there were no more HP books to read, I went into a sort of withdrawal, counting down the days until the next installment became available .,
I went and watched all the movies on opening weekend .,
I was utterly obsessed .,
The thing that I am most grateful for is the love of reading that was instilled in me as a result of JK Rowling's books .,
Once I got a taste of the excitement of reading, I couldn't stop .,
And that, my friends, is why reading is now my favorite thing to do .,
That is why I began to write my own stories, plays, and poems, and am currently working on a novel that I hope to publish one day .,
I owe all this to JK Rowling .,
I can't thank her enough for what her books have done for me .,
The story of Harry Potter, an eleven-year-old boy horribly abused and neglected by his "family," if you can even call the Dursleys a family, was one that saddened me when I first read of it .,
It still saddens me to this day .,
Still, as a little kid, whenever I went through some hard times, I always told myself that Harry had it worse than me and he endured .,
I aspired to be like Harry .,
If he could deal with the Dursleys, then I could deal with whatever life threw at me .,
Harry Potter is the kind of kid I would love to have as a friend .,
He's brave, humble, and loyal .,
I find myself forgetting that he's a fictional character as I read, but at the same time wishing with all my heart that I could meet someone like him .,
And then we have Ron .,
Ron was hilarious, what with his dry humor and sarcasm that never came across as bitter or like he was trying too hard .,
While I noticed that he was self-conscious about his family's financial situation, he wasn't all "woe is me" about it .,
He was a good and loyal friend to Harry.As for Hermione, I adored her .,
I found myself connecting with her on such a personal level .,
I could relate to almost everything she went through .,
I also happen to have a mane of bushy brown hair, brown eyes, buck teeth (before I got braces), and a love of books and libraries .,
I too am a huge goody-two-shoes that many people would consider smart .,
But most of all, I have a habit of shooting my hand up in the air every time a teacher asks a question .,
Snape would probably despise me .,
Hermione was practical, smart, responsible, and a great friend .,
Her amazing cleverness and skill in magic is even more commendable because of the fact that she's Muggle-born .,
She'd had no prior experience with magic of any kind before coming to Hogwarts, and still she came out top of her class in her first year .,
Take that, Draco!,
Speaking of Draco, allow me to rant about the obnoxious git .,
He was the most contemptible, pompous, jealous, spoiled little brat I've ever encountered in a book .,
He seemed to have absolutely nothing better to do than follow Harry and his friends around and ruin their lives in any way possible .,
Ugh .,
Someone needs to hit this kid .,
Still, there's a part of me that feels bad for Draco too .,
I think all of his hatred for Harry and his friends is really jealousy .,
Think about it this way .,
Harry had great friends, Draco has dumb, mean cronies .,
Harry is famous, Draco doesn't get any attention .,
Harry's great at quidditch, Draco's not really good at anything (though he does excel in douchebaggery) .,
While the bad still outweighs the good, we have to remember that he's just a lonely, jealous kid that needs to lash out at someone.Now lets talk about one of my favorite characters: Severus Snape .,
I love him .,
Is that so wrong?,
I adore that man .,
My opinion of him has never changed .,
Sure, I knew he was a jerk in all the books and I got so angry at him at those times .,
At the same time, though, I was thoroughly amused by his sarcastic, caustic wit .,
You have to admit, he's funny, mysterious, complex, and even sexy, in his own weird way .,
As I continued with the series, I grew stronger feelings for him .,
Stronger annoyance at his bouts of meanness, stronger understanding of why he did what he did, and finally, in the last book, a stronger love and respect of his character .,
The first time I read Sorcerer's Stone, I was so confused!,
Did he hate Harry or didn't he?,
Was he trying to kill Harry or save him?,
This is what I love most about Snape .,
The inner machinations of his mind are an enigma (if you know where that line is from, go buy yourself an ice cream) .,
Then we have Hagrid: the sweetest, cutest giant of them all .,
I love his adorable accent, his love of deadly animals, and how much of a great father figure he is for Harry, Ron, and Hermione .,
I think his ludicrous belief that deadly creatures are actually harmless stems from his own personal experience .,
At first Hagrid seems threatening and hostile because of his size and wild appearance, when really he is a huge sweetheart .,
In this way, he feels he can relate to the dangerous creatures that he loves .,
Except the majority of these creatures don't turn out to be sweethearts like Hagrid.As for the Dursleys, I cannot deal with them .,
I despise these people .,
Can't stand them for the life of me .,
Somehow, I almost find myself hating them more than I hate Voldemort, especially Petunia .,
God damn it woman, this kid is your BLOOD relative .,
He is your sister's son, and you treat him like a prisoner .,
You wouldn't even treat strangers that way!,
As much as I despised this family, I found them funny as well, particularly Vernon's angry explosions .,
And last, but most certainly not least, there is Albus Dumbledore .,
I love him for his cute craziness, as well as his wisdom .,
I've never seen a better combination of the two .,
He is a wonderful father figure for Harry .,
Still, the mystery surrounding him frustrates me .,
What did he see in the Mirror of Erised, dammit?!,
The world will never know.All in all, this series remains my favorite of all time .,
Thank you, JK Rowling, for all you've done for me and for millions of other people all over the world .,
"Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself."Very true, isn't it?My words while reading: stunning, terrific. .,
(can't stop myself from praising this book)One of the best books ever!,
My emotions are still in the influence of this book's ending .,
What a great book and the ending it was!SETTINGS --- Hogwart School of Witchcraft and WizardryOne of the finest school for wizards and witches to learn magic .,

He lives with his uncle and aunt (I didn't like them as they were so rude with Harry), who don't tell him he is a WIZARD!,
Even though they knew it.My Feelings--- A very appealing and effective character .,
I liked him very much.One thing I didn't like about him: (view spoiler)[ I was expecting some more magic from him but he didn't do more then once or twice, as much as I remember .,
(hide spoiler)]RonBio--- One of Harry's best friends.My Feelings--- A good one .,
I also liked him almost as much as I liked Harry .,
HermioneBio--- Also one of Harry's best friends .,
She has a very brilliant mind .,
My Feelings--- Actually, I didn't get any feelings while reading her .,
I don't know why?,
Although she is very well written .,
But I liked her dialogues with Ron .,
That's sort of..HUMOROUS.VoldemortBio--- A bad wizard .,
Main antagonist of this series, I assume and the killer of Harry's parents .,
He also tried to kill Harry but couldn't and He vanishes after that and nobody knows where he is?My Feelings--- He seems a powerful antagonist I will ever read .,
he didn't appear much .,
This book just gives us the introduction of his existence .,
But I am sure I will enjoy reading him in the next books.Albus Dumbledore(Headmaster of Hogwarts) and Hagrid(Keeper of Hogwarts) .,
Both of them seem nice persons to me.OVERVIEWHarry finds out he is a wizard when Hagrid gives him the letter from Hogwarts for admission .,
Harry's life changes completely while studying in Hogwarts when they(Harry, Ron and Hermione) run across the forbidden section of the 3rd floor of Hogwarts .,
(view spoiler)[ There is a stone named Sorcerer's Stone which can extend your life and transform any material into gold .,
This stone is hidden in that section of the 3rd floor and a dog(who is very big in size and have three heads), and many enchantments are guarding it .,
(hide spoiler)]A very big spoiler: (view spoiler)[ Voldemort is after this stone because he becomes too week after killing trying to kill harry .,
If he gets the Stone he will become powerful, again .,
(hide spoiler)]THINGS I LIKEDEverything!,
from beginning to ending except for one minor thing (see next section).QuidditchI liked this sport a lot .,
When I came to know about it I thought "Author will skip this and announce the winner" BUT author wrote this sport in such a brilliant way that I want more on this sport .,
There is a book on this and I will read that book soon.Last ChapterJust one line: "Anyone can betray anyone."This book contains a good deal of very entertaining scenes .,
I liked the imagination of author.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE (not that much)Nicolas Flamel's IntoductionThis book took little long time to introduce Nicolas (friend of Dumbledore and (view spoiler)[the maker of Sorcerer's Stone (hide spoiler)]), 2 chapters (arround 30 pages) .,
I couldn't like it much because Harry was wondering he had heard/read that name before but he didn't remember it right now .,
I can understand .,
BUT 2 CHAPTERS!,
Seriously!,
Even though we knew where Harry had read that name .,
In the train when he was coming to Hogwarts .,
It didn't look good to me or I couldn't find any fair reason to make this topic that long.I didn't completely hate that fact .,
I liked it but not that much I liked the whole things in the book.RECOMMENDATIONEveryone should read it regardless of their tastes, I mean, favourite genre .,
I don't think there would be a person on this planet (silly thing to say) who would dare to hate this book .,
I have become a very big fan of this series .,
It is not a surprise who wouldn't be .,
I highly recommend this book to those who hasn't started reading .,
This book would be a great start for them.CONCLUSIONI must say author has done a good deal of hard work .,
She wrote every scene in such a way that there would be no need of any visual form of this .,
I could visualize every scene of this book very easily while reading .,
I didn't thought I would read this type of writing style after Rick Riordan's .,
She is on second position in my list of Author's-Writing-Style .,
SORRY!,
I can't replace Rick Riordan's style with anybody's .,
I liked his style more than anybody's .,
I am really looking forward to read Parcy Jackson series BUT you know, 2 series of 10 books (5 in each) is more than enough books for me to read right now .,
BUT Sooner or later I will read that series too.According to fact I mentioned above, I would like to give:**** 5 Lifelong Shinning Stars ****Point out my mistakes and my misunderstanding about this book if there are any .,
I would be happy to see that!Thanks for your attention!QUOTES I LIKED"He didn't know what was going to - but it had to be better than what he was leaving.""..hard work and pain are the best teachers..""Petrificus Totalus!""It was one of those occasions when the true story is even more and exciting than the wild rumors.""..you couldn't have everything in life.""'The truth' Dumbledore sighed .,
'It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution."[ I was expecting some more magic from him but he didn't do more then once or twice, as much as I remember .,

Just wanted to spend two words on this piece of art before starting Chamber of Secrets illustrated that I just received *screams*This book for me will be forever sacred .,
It's the very first book that I read 100% without the help of anybody, I was like 7/8 and I fell in love with the Wizarding World immediately.Of course I didn't get everything at that time because I was probably too young to understand certain things and the book really touches very important themes that you can't actually underJust wanted to spend two words on this piece of art before starting Chamber of Secrets illustrated that I just received *screams*This book for me will be forever sacred .,

I re-read it at least 5/6 times and growing up I found it every time more entertaining and meaningful .,
The world is amazing, the characters are amazing (every single one), the story is amazing, everything is amazing xDI think almost everyone knows the story. .,
So no plot/summary from me hahaThis series is and will ever be a HUGE part of my life and everything started with this particular book.Last but not least: The illustrated edition, which is stunning!,
The pictures are just eye candy, I like how it's written in columns and the full page illustrations are everything awww ** (The illustration of Quirrell is pretty disturbing and I LOVE IT xD)Sorry if it was a little messy, it's probably not even a review lol but I wanted to share a little piece of myself with you :')  .,
Yes, I realise I already own two copies of this book BUT this one is illustrated - that makes all the difference surely?,
It can't possibly be wrong to buy a book that looks this beautiful can it?As soon as I saw images of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone: Illustrated Edition I knew I had to have it, as a huge fan of the series and someone who already owns several print versions as well as the ebook of each Harry Potter story there was no way I could miss out on this beautiful new editionYes, I realise I already own two copies of this book BUT this one is illustrated - that makes all the difference surely?,

There is absolutely no point in me writing another review of the story (you can read my original one HERE) because I'm pretty sure that most of the people who are going to be looking at buying this book are already going to be Harry Potter fans so instead I'm going to focus on the quality of the book and the illustrations.To put it simply this book is STUNNING .,
I had high expectations but was totally blown away by how beautiful this book is, it brings back the magical feeling of reading Harry Potter for the first time and I think it's definitely a perfect edition to read with children .,
Jim Kay has done a fantastic job of giving new life to the characters, he's managed to make them his own (which must have been quite hard to do considering how well everyone knows the actors from the movies) while still making them instantly recognisable.The book itself is a lot larger than I expected and has me wondering if they'll have to publish the later books in more than one edition .,
The quality is brilliant with lovely glossy pages and gorgeous illustrated end pages .,
This is the kind of book that you want to treasure and it would make a perfect gift for any Harry Potter fan .,
I can't wait to see the illustrated editions of the rest of the series and will definitely be purchasing them as soon as they're published.I'm going to finish this review with a couple of pictures so you can see just how beautiful some of the illustrations are: Harry in the cupboard under the stairs An owl delivery The Sorting Hat Beautiful end pages  .,
It wasnU+2019t much of a shock when the world learned, upon the completion of the Harry Potter octology, that J.K. Rowling was formerly a high ranking agent in MI6 .,

RowlingU+2019s memoranda and comminiquU+00E9 had always leaned towards the florid; she was the natural choice when the nationU+2019s intelligence agency decided to U+201CretireU+201D one of their most decorated agents and move her into a new role .,
It turned out to be one of the greatest propaganda coups in Western Civilization.The formerly defunct MI7, created specifically in the early 1900s for the type of work Rowling would be asked to do, was clandestinely revived with the resources to support a lone agent with a singular purpose: create a new British hero .,
What they did not want was a James Bond reboot - a cavalier, womanizing anti-hero that righted the worldU+2019s ills at the draw of a gun .,
The new world required a new kind of icon, someone with whom the pre-teens of the U+201890s could relate .,
U+201CIU+2019ve got this,U+201D Rowling was rumored to have said .,
A classic understatement, in every sense.Book One of the Potter series establishes all of the important tropes and themes that any propogandist worth her salt would employ .,
Rowling even put her prowess at anagrams to good use .,
Harry Potter: Try Hero Part .,
HarryU+2019s feckless aunt, representing the American hegemony, is a personal favorite .,
Petunia Darsley: Easily Upturned .,
Potter is the offspring of two famous practitioners of magic, their deaths representative of the twin pasts of former British rule: supremacy of international commerce and the resulting colonialism .,
The young Harry doesnU+2019t know about his past - he must learn about it in a classic unfolding narrative that reveals how special he (i.e .,
the UK) really is .,
The tutelage and mentorship of Hogwarts has been shown to be a thinly veiled allusion to the European Union .,
Online chatrooms and water cooler discussions over the past 20 years have been filled with opinions on which EU member is represented by Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, etc. - suffice to say that it is another testament to RowlingU+2019s brilliance that she has never offered any opinions to the discussions; allowing the punters their pet views, however misguided, only strengthened the allegory.It is said that the creation of the storyU+2019s villain was RowlingU+2019s most difficult task .,
To take on the USA directly, the UKU+2019s closest ally and the last global power, was strictly off limits .,
Still, that didnU+2019t stop the speculation that America was indeed the antagonist (the whole U+201CdonU+2019t-speak-his-nameU+201D thing taken too literal), but as declassified documents have shown, RowlingU+2019s intention from the start was for Voldemort to be the representation of all the evilU+2019s of British past, for if the UK was to ever achieve its new ascendancy, it must first not be afraid to speak - and acknowledge - its former horrors; it must learn from those mistakes and grow strong with the help of its new world allies in hope of one day achieving that new Golden Age of the British Empire .,

Being back with Harry, Ron, Hermione, Neville, Fred and George, Hagrid, and everyone else made me so happy .,
There are some things that I had forgotten like how much I dislike the Dursley's, the purple and black fire walls scene at the end, and how much I love Dumbledore .,
So those were great to revisit .,
If you haven't already, pick up these books .,
They are so worth it .,
I'll keep waiting on my Hogwarts letter, even though it almost feels like I've already been .,

What can I possibly say about Harry Potter?,
The boy who made everyone, whether child or adult, fall in love with him?,
Everything has been said..I just want one of those..So I can..And then I will..Because. .,
I loved this book, I loved how there was a mystery that Harry had to solve among being new to Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry .,
It was beautifully written, and although marked as a "Childrens book", I being a teenager still loved it .,
When you find out the teacher that was working for Voldemort I gasped so loud my mother received a noise complaint .,
I read it in the summer and finished it in a matter of days .,
Overall: 5 stars  .,
I have only seen the Harry Potter movies up to now, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first book in the series .,
I actually liked reading this more than seeing the movie of it .,
This was great .,
I can't believe I've waited so long to read it. .,
better late than never, I suppose .,
Review to come, and expect to see another six HP reviews from me in the coming months!,
There's no words :') I think I love this book more every time I read it!,
Tornare ad Hogwarts U+00E8 sempre un toccasana. .,
I'm the only person in the world with mixed feelings about the Harry Potter books .,
Most readers love them .,
There are non-readers who are indifferent to them as they are to all other books; others who go solely by the fact that they're "children's" books and therefore believe it's ridiculous for adults to read and enjoy them; and of course a legion of similarly anti-literacy folk who have decided the Harry Potter books are immoral .,

These people, who read and enjoy Tolkien, C.S .,
Lewis, and stories about Merlin and King Arthur, have concluded that the Potter universe is an evil place because it has magic and witches .,
All righty, then .,
I suppose there are readers who genuinely dislike the Harry Potter books .,
I haven't come across them, but they must be out there somewhere .,
And of course there must be readers who say they dislike them when what they mean is, they're wildly jealous that they didn't write them.I don't belong in any of those categories .,
I admire the fine writing, characterization, dialogue, and world-building Rowling has done .,
And exactly because her writing is so good, the one flaw I've found pains me to the point that I can't read these with the pure pleasure they give so many others.The only person I've talked to about this who's been willing to listen long enough to understand what I'm saying is the one person I know who hasn't read the books and has no plans to .,
He thinks I make a valid point .,
Everyone else I've attempted to engage on this topic has responded, "You're saying something bad about Harry Potter .,
You must be bad .,
I hate you .,
Please leave my home." Or words to that effect .,
I'll grant you that accepting flaws in things we love is a little-taught skill in this world .,
It's almost as rare as seeing good qualities in those we hate .,
This is as true with books as it is with people, and it's tragic .,
I have yet to meet someone who can acknowledge the admirable qualities of books they can't stand .,
I don't mean genuinely bad books, the kind that will be pulped a year after they were printed (if they last that long) or that will never make it to paper in the first place not because technology is awesome but because *nobody* wants to waste the paper on these works .,
No, I mean books that have stood the test of time but who have as many haters as lovers.Perfect example: Little Women .,
People adore this book, or they despise it.Listen up: "Little Women" is corny, mawkish, and sentimental .,
It's also wise, funny, and strong .,
Whether you like the book or you hate it, if you can't admit that all of this is true and this can all be true at the same time about the same book, you have a serious ego problem .,
You can't admit that the book you love could have anything wrong with it .,
("Krinkle, krinkle, 'ittle 'tar"?,
Really?,
That's not cringe-inducing?,
Calling a grown woman "Marmee" isn't cringe-inducing?,
Having the one black child at Jo's school for boys be the best singer isn't seriously cringe-inducing?) .,
Or else you refuse to entertain the idea that anything you hate could have anything right about it .,
(Marmee's advice to Meg about the difference between the flashing tempers of the March girls and the temperament of the man Meg married stands the test of time very well, as do plenty of the other observations of humanity -- when Jo laughingly admits that she's well enough to go on a carriage ride with Laurie, but not well enough to do disagreeable chores, and then karma kicks her in the arse .,
Which it tends to do a lot in this book.)Put your ego aside when thinking about and discussing literature .,
Good books are not saints .,
They should be admired, enjoyed, learned from, and reread; but they should also be critically examined .,
And if I've done all that with the Harry Potter books and I've found something I think is a serious flaw, it would be nice to be able to discuss that, rather than be glared and yelled at (yes, both have happened, and yes, I'm still angry) because I have the unmitigated gall to find something wrong with Saint Jo.For anyone who's still reading: I'm very uncomfortable with one aspect of the world Rowling has created .,
Specifically, I don't think her justification for hiding the existence of magic from the world of ordinary humans stands up well in a court of ethics.This is a review of the first book, so I'll only go into what she says here .,
When Harry Potter first learns who is parents really are, Hagrid is furious at the Dursleys for not having told him anything about what he calls Harry's world .,
"Our world, I mean .,
Your world .,
My world .,
Yer parents' world." It's terribly wrong not to have told Harry who and what he is, and who and what his parents were .,
Agreed .,
How, then, is it all right to hide what is, after all, the real world from the majority of its inhabitants?,
How is it all right to scorn them for not having magic while at the same time doing everything to keep them from knowing magic exists?Don't say there's no scorn .,
"Muggle" is hardly a term of endearment .,
(Yes, I'm jumping ahead of myself and I promised I wouldn't, but "mud-blood" is nothing but an extension of the condescension contained in "Muggle.") And as for the attitude towards the mundane world, look at Hagrid -- one of the good guys, certainly, and a very appealing character:"Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way .,
He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.'I don't know how the Muggles manage without magic,' he said, as they climbed a broken-down escalator."We manage because you won't let us do otherwise .,
And then you sneer at the job we do.Let me ask you something: Do you really believe that "separate but equal" can be both?,
That's not how it works in the real world, and it's not how it works in Potter's world .,
The magical beings there are an elite minority, and they like it that way .,
They have the power .,
They're hanging on to it by force (more about that in later books), even when that puts the inhabitants of the mundane world at risk (WAY more about that in later books).Let me ask you something else: If you read and enjoy Austen's novels in the way that many people do -- taking pleasure in imagining yourself a member of that world -- you imagine yourself as one of the genteel, right?,
Not one of the servants .,
We see very little of them, and they have miserable lives .,
The power situation in Austen's time was horribly imbalanced and unfair .,
Austen wasn't in much of a position to do anything about it; but at least she didn't have her characters brag all the time about how awesome it was to be of the land-owning class, and how pathetic those stupid servants are.In fact, the one character I can think of who does complain about servants is Aunt Norris, and she's an out-and-out villain .,
Her observations on the serving class are meant to reinforce just what a nasty piece of work she is.One person I know claimed that in the Potter universe, the magic-users keep their existence and powers a secret in order to protect themselves .,
That's contradicted later -- I think in book #3, in which Harry reads a textbook about how much real witches enjoy being burned at the stake because it tickles and doesn't do them any harm -- but for now I'll just point out what Hagrid says when Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic "keeps it from the Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down the country.""Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions to their problems .,
Nah, we're best left alone."If Rowling wanted to make a universe in which a failed attempt had been made in the past to live on equal terms with the non-magic world, and that attempt had led to great suffering and many lives lost on both sides, that would be perfectly tenable .,
(And fascinating .,
Somebody, write that book .,
Okay, I will.) If she wanted to claim that magic-users would be persecuted by the ordinary humans, and the magicians might have the magic but the mundane world had the sheer numbers and a lot of nasty technology on their side, that would certainly work .,
And then I could read these books without a qualm.Instead, she's created a world in which a ruling class cheerfully admits that they like having all the really cool stuff and they're jolly well not going to share with those foolish mortals who are so stupid, they have to struggle up broken escalators.What troubles me even more than her making this decision (which, as I've pointed out, is not the only way to go if you want to have a world of hidden magic) is how enthusiastically her readers have embraced it .,
There are "No Muggles Allowed" posters and Facebook pages .,
Created and enjoyed by people who don't seem to realize that, just as they'd more likely be a servant than gentility in Austen's world, odds are good they'd be Muggles in Rowling's .,
People who have felt odd and left out all their lives naturally embrace the idea that secretly, they're special and strong -- magical, even .,
I only question the idea that having wonderful abilities has to go hand in hand with lording it over those who don't .,
How is the Potter universe's attitude toward non-magic users any different from Malfoy's gloating over his entirely inherited monetary wealth, and sneering at Ron's poverty?I'm very uncomfortable with the Potter universe because I don't have the ego to believe I'd be one of the special ones .,
I'm rereading these with my son because he doesn't remember them very well and his grandmother kindly lent us an entire hardcover library of the British editions .,
This journey has its pleasures, but it's the last I'll take to the Potter world .,
It's no place for Muggles.UPDATE: I'm now about a hundred pages into the British edition of the last Harry Potter book, and I'm already seriously considering rereading the whole series just to have the entire, incredibly complex plot fresh in my head for once .,
Yes, the things that bug me philosophically about this series still bother me; but the writing is just too good for even cranky old me to resist .,

This is the magical place where book worms are born!!HP turns reluctant readers into series bookworms and devourers of book series, and this is true for my eleven year old daughter .,
I began reading the Harry Potter series to her two years ago and she quickly fell in love with the HP world and characters .,
She laughed, cried, celebrated with and cheered for HP and his friends .,
She can even remember the names of each of the characters in the whole series!,
Reading Harry Potter has opened up a world of books for her and now she's reading Gail carriger's Waistcoats & Weaponry book three in the Finishing School series and she has already finished reading The Naughtiest Girl in the School series, a few YA (middle grade) paranormal books, The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset and my YA horror book Warm Bodies, and she loved it!,
I think my little bookworm is about to raid my stash of books and I better move my romance/grown up books out of the way until she's a bit older.Once again, I finished reading Harry Potter and Philosopher's Stone but this time I read it with my nine year old son .,
He's a reluctant reader who loves the outdoors and computer games so I decided to use HP to improve his reading skills and perhaps help him discover love of books.He loves watching the HP movies (only the first three) but this is the first time he has read Harry Potter and Philosopher's Stone and he tells me the book is better than the movie!,
I'm so proud of him!,
He's upset the movies left out Peeves the Poltergeist, the prankster ghost and his new favourite character .,
He's already quoting The Philosopher's Stone (and he's adding a few twists of his own) and it's pretty funny and adorable!,
We've already started Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, It's going to take us a long time to finish the HP series but it'll all be worth it in the end .,
Already a new generation is discovering the phenomenal, magical and beautiful series that is Harry Potter and I'm so happy to play a small part in this discovery .,

Awful in every way .,
The whole book is centered on lame, even deplorable ideas .,
First, it divides people into the wizardly and the non-wizardly in a class system .,
That's a fairly lame idea already, but other than deriding some of the snobby elitists among the wizardly class, it is itself ridiculously elitist, presenting its only non-wizardly people as an overblown, idiotic parody of middle class small-mindedness, conformity, and materialism, and making the elevation into the wizard class anAwful in every way .,

Second, it makes the magical into the mundane .,
Otherworldly and magical things, things beyond the everyday, are trivialized by transposing them into a world of magic shops and wizard schools essentially no different from non-magic shops and non-wizard schools .,
(It doesn't help that all the magical things are stock s, with absolutely no originality or imagination.)Outside its center of lameness, the book fails in all its basic storytelling s .,
It's written in a completely standardized kids-book style, full of simplistic exaggerations, stock phrases, and twee comments from the narrator .,
Even if that style didn't irritate me with its obviousness and simplification, it's utterly indistinct here: the words have no verve .,
It does nothing of note to create suspense, excitement, pathos, vivid imagery, or anything else .,
And the dialogue is flat and unnatura
