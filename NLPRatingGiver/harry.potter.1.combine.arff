"Hes the boy who lived loved and won our hearts Hermoine is so incredibly inspiring OK so this is pretty obvious to anyone who reads the book no matter their age ",character
"But its even more powerful and inspiring to watch Hermoine grow up from an older perspective ",character
"She is the definition of a selfmade woman ",character
"Hailing from muggle origins the daughter of dentists no less only child Hermoine Granger has to rely on her own gumption to succeed at Hogwarts ",character
"She doesnt have magical blood a famous pedigree a secret vault full of money or even an older sibling to teach her the ropes ",character
"But gosh darn it shes got the library and a copy of Hogwarts A History and shes going to succeed if it kills her As a fellow young woman trying to make my way in the world how could Hermoine not be my hero",character

"If its been a while since you read the Potter books youre in for an avalanche of new lessons and feels that you might have been too young to appreciate the first time around ",neither
"So what is Harry Potter and The Philosophers Stone Good question ",neither
"But first I ask you what is magic To me magic is the captivating voice of the imagination transmutable and quantifiable it finds its verve in the proper arrangement of words ",neither
"These words can make you laugh and cry and dream dreams that will never die It would go without saying that Jo Rowling changed the world when she created Harry Potter and the result is a deeply meaningful and shareable universe as vast and grand as Star Wars Final Fantasy and enrapturing works that have continued to span generations with the perfect combination of action creativity and character ",plot
"As this is my very first reading of Harry Potter and I have never seen the movies though some things have been spoiled but not many I was so happy to treat myself with the release of Vault of Dreams to the UK Bloomsbury set that comes in a wonderful red box and I have two lovely friends to thank for this Chelsea Slytherpuff and Chenda Slytherin because without their friendship and enthusiasm this vast landscape of literary gold would still be void in my life Whilst Potter is undeniably English its likability constitutes some of the very best qualities of Anglophilia like Christmas pudding and the Hogwarts Express and reminds us that the stone set in the silver sea has not only some of the greatest writers male and female the world has ever seen but continues to capture our lust for fantastical adventure as a place so heavily steeped in magic mystery and muggledom that Potter Us inherent Englishness makes it overly charming and utterly adorable and for me tearfully nostalgic ",plot
"The very definition of timeless not only for its colorful cast of characters a true ensemble series this is",character
"With someone for everyone to love or hate or its prose lighter than CS Lewis Narnia but just as enchanting or its cleverness and conceptualization Harry Potter finds the precious space in our hearts that weve all been endowed the perfect space to live and dream and desire to be great to know that destiny is a powerful force at work in our lives but life is still and adventure full of choices and the key to truly living is truly the most unexplainably magical idea there is was and ever will be and that is loveRecommended for everyoneAnd get that beautiful red box set whilst youre at it",plot
"Rereading Harry Potter always feels like coming home ",plot
"It was so nice to start at the beginning with Harry before he knew he was a wizard ",plot
"The wonder and amazement he felt as he arrived at Hogwarts ",plot
"The friendship that formed among Harry Ron and Hermione ",plot
"Also seeing the little things when I know now how everything ends and ties together ",plot
"Its just the coziest most beautiful feeling to be back at Hogwarts and I cannot wait to continue my reread of the series ",plot
"To the wellorganized mind death is but the next great adventure This has been one of the most sweet and beautiful readings Ive had but I must say that for me has been more like a rereading even when Ive never read this one before since Ive seen the first movie a thousand times ",plot
"Therefore there has been no surprises for me this time it doesnt mean didnt liked me contrary I liked it and I enjoyed a fast paced fresh and full of magic reading what else could ask I love the characters they have the most varied personalities and you can easily love them ",character
"I particularly have a great weakness for Hagrid and Dumbledore who has the most beautiful and profound sentences in this book besides always manages to take off a smile ",character
"It is a beautiful and terrible thing and should therefore be treated with great caution So I hope to continue with the series and hopefully every time can surprise me a bit more and more it is nice to see at last why fuss xDPS I managed to understand with this book that the film has been so successful because it clearly is a reflection of the book for me it was easy to imagine each scene and thats incredible Cuz I know as readers we always excited us with the idea that our favorite book this on the big screen and the truth its that never reach our expectations ending to be only a shadow of what the book was ",neither
"In this case I value that have respected so much the book when they did the movie it is something to highlight ",neither
"It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live",neither
"I swear every time I read this book I fall even more in love with it",plot
"This series because Ive read the whole series is and will always be one of my favourites I loved everything about it and just the whole plot is amazing ",plot
"Sometimes books never live up to their hype but with this book I can actually understand why so many people like it ",plot
"I cant even explain my love for this series ",plot
"Ive watched the movies so many times and read the books only once which is probably why Im reading it again ",neither
"I do have to admit I was really late and read this book only last year ",neither
"After reading the Cursed Child I just had to read this series again and so I did and I loved it even more I read this series around the end of last year but I have a perfectly good explanation for that ",neither
"Oh and also I may have made the mistake of watching the movies many times before reading the books ",neither
"I was quite young when I first wanted to read the series ",neither
"I was maybe years old or younger and because I was a stupid little child that knew nothing about the series I decided to read three of the books out of order ",neither
"I didnt realise I had to read them in order and I didnt even know the order ",neither
"So anyway it took me around months to finish Goblet of Fire and one month to finish HalfBlood Prince ",neither
"I mean come on I was young and didnt read as much as I do now ",neither
"After that I never really cared about the series ",neither
"Around two years ago I became one of those people that thought Harry Potter was overrated Im so sorry guys ",neither
"I didnt know why it was so popular and didnt think it was that great I didnt read that much at the time ",neither
"Then I watched the movies and loved them and decided to order the first book online ",neither
"It arrived and I was so excited and then It was in some random language that I didnUt understand ",neither
"I didnt even know what language it was",neither
"That was when I gave up on the series until last year where I decided to read the series ",neither
"Now after all that unnecessary information on to the actual story ",neither
"I read this two weeks ago and I cant remember the small details to do a review so this is going to be a very brief review ",neither
"Everyones probably read this book so Im not going to say what its about because that would be unnecessary ",neither
"Everything about this book is wonderful and the magical world just blew me away ",plot
"Im so obsessed that sometimes my sister who hasnt read the books was but watched the movies and I pretend to fight for like one minute and shout out spells at each other ",neither
"Yeah Im really weird ",neither
"Now dont get me wrong I love all the character the good ones but someone of the main characters arent that bright cough Harry cough ",character
"To be honest I didnt really think he was that dumb until my friend showed me this thing about why Harry Potter is not in Ravenclaw and it made me realise that he is really an idiot ",character
"I would tell you what the reasons are but they spoil the other books so Im just going to say them when I read the other books ",neither
"There is one situation where Harry tries to catch the letters in the air and not just pick one of the ground and hide it ",neither
"They were everywhere so why the hell does he need to grab the ones flying ",character
"Yeah he does manage to get one but he could have got one in a second ",character
"Hermione is my favourite character mainly because shes so smart and without her none of it would have been possible ",character
"Harry was so stupid and dont get me started on Ron ",character
"Hermione was amazing she was the one that was able to figure everything out ",character
"This series will always be a series that I will never get sick of ",plot
"I read this book so quickly ",neither
"I flew through it and didnUt even realise it ",plot
"Everything about is is just perfect and if youre someone who doesnt read this is the best book to get you into it ",neither
"Even though this is my second time reading it and I know everything that happens it still is just as good ",plot
"Also do not be deceived this book is not for children only ",neither
"Fairly standard kids fantasy fare from Rowling as she reintroduces the world to the classic British fairy tale which had been mostly forgotten since Tolkien spliced it with the epic ",plot
"She mines gold from this rich and storied tradition but doesnt really fashion anything unique from it We can see the beginnings of Rowlings authorial failings and a hint of her strengths as well ",plot
"She adopts Rouald Dahls awful family trope though its clear that Rowling does not have the gift of bizarre characterization or the knowledge of the darker parts of the human soul that made his books resonate She writes sympathetic characters but not unusual ones ",plot
"Overall her writing has relatively little character or style ",neither
"Then again mass success often requires leaving the more unusual s behind ",neither
"So she relies on standard character types managing to keep them afloat through the patented perpetual plot of the airplane book She also pulls from that old British tradition of children lost in fairyland seen often in early fantasy Dunsany Eddison which Lewis also made use of ",neither
"She also has the vast unknown underground of magic just beneath our world which keeps itself always mysterious and quiet much favored by Gaiman and other Urban Fantasy authors though Rowlings invented world is strained and piecemeal moreso as the series goes on The strength of the book is that it combines the tradition of the child in fairyland with another British standby the boarding school bildungsroman ",plot
"Its the same neat trick Mervyn Peake pulled in Gormenghast though Rowlings version is tame in comparison ",neither
"Her tale of the intellectual emotional and physical growth of the young outcast everyman is rather predictable except for some insight into angst in the fifth bookRowlings prose is quick and simple but sometimes awkward and without music or joy ",plot
"It is not the sort of deliberate simplicity Carroll achieved by expressing complex ideas in playful terms ",neither
"It is rather the sign of an author whose unsophisticated voice prevents her language from vaulting higher Simplistic elegance is deceptively difficult to achieve and so its hard to blame Rowling too much when she falters ",neither
"Its unfortunate that she didnt put a few failed books under her belt before finding success as such early outings are often best winnowed chaff Her plottingas everis scattered and convenient though in a shorter book it shows less ",neither
"Her plot twists as usual disappoint they are not built upon progression of events but upon reader expectation and emotional red herringsIts the beginning of an enjoyable series but theres really no need to start any earlier than the third book when Rowling finally finds her pace and begins to lean more heavily on that which she does well which helps to hide her faults ",plot
"Watch the movie if you need a primer My Fantasy Book Suggestions ",neither
"its even better with the drop dead gorgeous illustrations and i didnt think that was possible ",neither
"i only wish it had come out when i was a child because i probably would have loved it even more",neither
"Codswallop in my opinion ",plot
"Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die Gosh Ive missed this series ",neither
"Im not going to bother with a proper review because no review written by me could ever do this book or this series for that matter justice ",neither
"Im not going to bother with a description of the plot because unless youve been living under a rock for the past almost years you know what Harry Potter is about ",neither
"Instead this is just a spot for me to put down my thoughts feelings and history with this series Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone was first released in the US on September by Scholastic ",neither
"I was years old the same age that my daughter my oldest is now ",neither
"But I didnt read this that year ",neither
"I actually read this out of order initially and read this book only after reading and falling in love with Chamber of Secrets ",plot
"So I was the first time I ever picked up a Harry Potter book the same age as Harry and company in this book ",neither
"For me it made it all the more magical and relatable to grow up alongside the characters and to be roughly the same age as they were as the books were released ",neither
"I had already enjoyed reading but Harry Potter is the first book series that I ever truly loved that I could read over and over again and never grow tired of itI still react with shock to the people who tell me theyve ONLY watched these movies never read the books my husband included and start ranting about all the amazing details theyre missing out onIm almost as bad as a religious fanatic in that regard trying to convert everyone into a Potterhead ",plot
"I cant even watch the movies without thinking about everything from the books being left out Now here I am years later as an adult and with a family of my own finally reading my illustrated copy of the first Harry Potter book ",neither
"Which is GORGEOUS",neither
"This edition is a MUST for any true fan ",neither
"Now that Im older I appreciate Rowlings writing that much more ",neither
"It truly is magical ",plot
"She manages to create a whole amazing world with details galore and manages to introduce you into the world without it feeling like a huge info dump ",plot
"Everything is so carefully explained that it all feels completely legit ",plot
"For me she will always be the Queen hands down",neither
"This was a reread for me obviously and it was so heartwarming and perfect ",plot
"Rereading Harry Potter is like coming home ",plot
"I listened to it on audio because Jim Dale is bae ",neither
"Seriously his Hagrid voice is my life ",neither
