'Awal baca dulu saya beranggapan Harry ini kepo banget ',neither
'Kenapa sih pusing banget sama kemungkinan Sorcerer Stone dicuri sama Voldemort',neither
'Kenapa gak kirim Hedwig aja ke Dumbledore sih buat warning itu adalah pertanyaan saya duluSekarang saya ngerti kenapaSeperti yang dibilang Harry Dumbledore tahu bahwa Harry butuh untuk mencoba melawan karena pertarungan dengan Voldemort itu personal untuk Harry ',neither
'Gimana pun Voldemort lah yang membunuh orangtua Harry ',neither
'Dan Harry sadar kalo Voldemort bisa kembali menyerang diaTapi terutama karena Harry sadar bahwa kembalinya Voldemort dapat membuat dia kehilangan dunia sihirHe was nothing in the muggle world ',neither
'Gak punya siapa pun dan apa pun ',neither

'Gak heran kalo Harry berkeras mempertahankannya ',neither
'Id do the same if I were him ',neither
'Id fight the nastiest wizard if I have to in order not to let something most precious being taken from me ',neither

'Tapi kualitas itu baru keliatan di buku kedua ato malah ketiga ',neither
'Yang pasti bukan di buku pertamaDulu saya gak ngerti apa yang bikin saya bersimpati sama Ron sejak awal ',neither

Wow,neither

'Kok saat itu tangan si Quirrell gak melepuh ya',neither
'Padahal sudah jelas kalo Voldemort telah nebeng di tubuh Quirrell saat ituKedelapan saya makin kagum deh sama JK RowlingOkesaya tahu kalo JKR emang banyak menggunakan bantuan mitos legenda ato apalah itu dalam ceritanya ',neither
'So its not really original ',neither
'Tapi toh emang gak ada formula yang benarbenar baru ',neither
'Yang penting sih gimana Rowling bisa meramu bahan yang ada ',neither
'And shes really good at itTapi yang sebenarnya keren dari Rowling adalah dia benarbenar paham karakter pembacanyaI guess in some points of our life even if its just for one time we ever felt like Harry whos a misfit and wishing to go to some place new where we could start everything from the scratch or becoming a different people ',neither
'But not everyone could do that ',neither
'Apparently Harry is one of those lucky peopleReading Harrys journey gave me happiness ',neither

'Bukannya tempat jauh antah berantah seperti di Middle Earth sana atau dunia magic namun tak terjangkau seperti Abarat ',neither
'Terlibatnya kaum manusia non sihir aka muggle juga tempattempat di Inggris seperti stasiun Kings Cross membuat cerita ini makin terasa dekat di hati membuat kita okesebenernya sih saya berani berharap bahwa suatu saat nanti saya juga bisa dapatehemsurat saya sendiri ',neither

'I admire the fine writing characterization dialogue and worldbuilding Rowling has done ',character
'And exactly because her writing is so good the one flaw Ive found pains me to the point that I cant read these with the pure pleasure they give so many othersThe only person Ive talked to about this whos been willing to listen long enough to understand what Im saying is the one person I know who hasnt read the books and has no plans to ',neither

'Which it tends to do a lot in this bookPut your ego aside when thinking about and discussing literature ',neither
'Good books are not saints ',neither
'They should be admired enjoyed learned from and reread but they should also be critically examined ',plot
'And if Ive done all that with the Harry Potter books and Ive found something I think is a serious flaw it would be nice to be able to discuss that rather than be glared and yelled at yes both have happened and yes Im still angry because I have the unmitigated gall to find something wrong with Saint JoFor anyone whos still reading Im very uncomfortable with one aspect of the world Rowling has created ',neither
'Specifically I dont think her justification for hiding the existence of magic from the world of ordinary humans stands up well in a court of ethicsThis is a review of the first book so Ill only go into what she says here ',neither

'How is it all right to scorn them for not having magic while at the same time doing everything to keep them from knowing magic existsDont say theres no scorn ',plot
'Muggle is hardly a term of endearment ',neither
'Yes Im jumping ahead of myself and I promised I wouldnt but mudblood is nothing but an extension of the condescension contained in Muggle And as for the attitude towards the mundane world look at Hagrid one of the good guys certainly and a very appealing characterAlthough Hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way ',character
'He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slowI dont know how the Muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalatorWe manage because you wont let us do otherwise ',character
'And then you sneer at the job we doLet me ask you something Do you really believe that separate but equal can be both',neither
'Thats not how it works in the real world and its not how it works in Potters world ',plot
'The magical beings there are an elite minority and they like it that way ',neither
'They have the power ',neither
'Theyre hanging on to it by force more about that in later books even when that puts the inhabitants of the mundane world at risk WAY more about that in later booksLet me ask you something else If you read and enjoy Austens novels in the way that many people do taking pleasure in imagining yourself a member of that world you imagine yourself as one of the genteel right',plot
'Not one of the servants ',neither
'We see very little of them and they have miserable lives ',neither
'The power situation in Austens time was horribly imbalanced and unfair ',neither
'Austen wasnt in much of a position to do anything about it but at least she didnt have her characters brag all the time about how awesome it was to be of the landowning class and how pathetic those stupid servants areIn fact the one character I can think of who does complain about servants is Aunt Norris and shes an outandout villain ',plot
'Her observations on the serving class are meant to reinforce just what a nasty piece of work she isOne person I know claimed that in the Potter universe the magicusers keep their existence and powers a secret in order to protect themselves ',neither
'Thats contradicted later I think in book in which Harry reads a textbook about how much real witches enjoy being burned at the stake because it tickles and doesnt do them any harm but for now Ill just point out what Hagrid says when Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic keeps it from the Muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the countryBlimey Harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems ',plot
'Nah were best left aloneIf Rowling wanted to make a universe in which a failed attempt had been made in the past to live on equal terms with the nonmagic world and that attempt had led to great suffering and many lives lost on both sides that would be perfectly tenable ',plot
'And fascinating ',neither
'Somebody write that book ',neither
'Okay I will If she wanted to claim that magicusers would be persecuted by the ordinary humans and the magicians might have the magic but the mundane world had the sheer numbers and a lot of nasty technology on their side that would certainly work ',neither
'And then I could read these books without a qualmInstead shes created a world in which a ruling class cheerfully admits that they like having all the really cool stuff and theyre jolly well not going to share with those foolish mortals who are so stupid they have to struggle up broken escalatorsWhat troubles me even more than her making this decision which as Ive pointed out is not the only way to go if you want to have a world of hidden magic is how enthusiastically her readers have embraced it ',plot
'There are No Muggles Allowed posters and Facebook pages ',character
'Created and enjoyed by people who dont seem to realize that just as theyd more likely be a servant than gentility in Austens world odds are good theyd be Muggles in Rowlings ',plot
'People who have felt odd and left out all their lives naturally embrace the idea that secretly theyre special and strong magical even ',neither
'I only question the idea that having wonderful abilities has to go hand in hand with lording it over those who dont ',neither
'How is the Potter universes attitude toward nonmagic users any different from Malfoys gloating over his entirely inherited monetary wealth and sneering at Rons povertyIm very uncomfortable with the Potter universe because I dont have the ego to believe Id be one of the special ones ',neither
'Im rereading these with my son because he doesnt remember them very well and his grandmother kindly lent us an entire hardcover library of the British editions ',neither
'This journey has its pleasures but its the last Ill take to the Potter world ',neither
