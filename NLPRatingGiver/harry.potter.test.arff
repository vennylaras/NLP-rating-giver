"He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype ",?
"However when Warner Bros ",?

"The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school ",?
"BlasphemyJust kidding ",?
"This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it ",?
"I was just kidding ",?
"To be frank I tried hard not to like this ",?
"I thought that giving this a or will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are up to now ignoring this book ",?
"I told you so",?
"Why waste your time",?

"When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books I couldnUt have been happier ",?
"As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang and I realized that IUd never done more than a perfunctory revieOn my list of reasons why my daughters are the bestest thing to ever happen to me Number is that they gave me at years old the perfect excuse to revisit the Harry Potter series ",?

"As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang and I realized that IUd never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume ",?
"I figured it was high time to rectify that oversightHarry deserves it ",?
"However with over a million ratings and almost two reviews for every day IUve been alive I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles ",?
"It has all been eloquently said before ",?
"Therefore I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people ",?
"Here goesOnly rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings ",?
"One that can hold at bay even if only for precious moments the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life ",?
"These stories do that ",?
"ItUs an escape into a world of optimism honor and hope where things always look hopeful and anything is possible ",?
"Who wouldnt want to hang around in a place like that especially when it is decorated with sorting hats kindly giants magic wands and QuidditchGrantedno aspect of the story is revolutionary or even particularly noteworthy from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre ",?
"It isnUt great literature and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success ",?
"Fineacknowledged ",?
"And",?
"So whatThe virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers ",?
"HarryUs story is something that radiates acceptance inclusion and friendship ",?
"It invokes a sense of belonging ",?
"Inside these pages you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanityUs nature and feel just a little better about the world around youHow is that not worthy of praiseAs for Harry himself heUs just a good kid ",?
"The quintessential everyman who makes good ",?
"A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him ",?
"HeUs someone you canUt help but like ",?
"HeUs not perfect ",?
"He makes mistakes heUs occasionally short sighted and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more ",?
"Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas ",?
"But thatUs not Harry ",?
"HeUs a better person than that ",?
"ThatUs why we love him ",?
"Maybe all of the above is a bit much ",?
"Like I said I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me ",?
"LetUs just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy ",?
"IUll certainly settle for that ",?
"As for the rating I Initially only gave this first volume stars and IUm not going to change that now ",?
"As much as I love the series as a whole I donUt think it reaches stratospheric heights until Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ",?
"Still this is where it all began ",?
"As such it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better stars ",?
"Highly Recommended ",?
"Yes Ive been living under a rock ",?

"I also find it stupid of me how I just recently decided to check this out and finally read it ",?
"But still I guess I can still write a review ",?
"Of course my thoughts would be quite similar to everyone else ",?
"Thoughts and opinions nothing negative maybe maybe not ",?
"But here goes nothingHarry Potter is one of the most famous loved and top series out there ",?
"It is loved adored cherished and amazing for HP fans every time they read it ",?
"No matter how many times it is read it fills the persons heart with warmth and happiness as they are going back to the wizarding world ",?
"As for me I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this because I am new to this allOther than that Harry Potter is considered a Childrens book but in my opinion its in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some ",?
"Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names ",?
"Harry Potter a story about a young wizard that didnt even know he was a wizard ",?
"Harry Potter a yearold boy who turned is living with his horrible rude and awful family The Dursleys ",?
"Mrs Dursley is known as Harry Potters mothers sister ",?
"The problem is they didnt like each other nor blend in with each other ",?
"They were different ",?
"Her sister was a witch while she was just a Muggle a person who cannot seek the magic and find it nothing and no one special because they arent able to turn things into other things arent able to fly on a broom cast a robe on fire defeat a villain confuse a troll arent able to do anything really ",?
"Well she wasnt besides treat Harry with such disrespect and treat her ugly and fat son with such caress and would spoil him because he was such a little brat that would get what he wants ",?
"Really though ",?
"There would be presents under a Christmas tree and as he counts them he pouts and is upset because its less than what he had the year before ",?
"DUDE I BARELY GET A BARNES AND NOBLE GIFT CARD CHILLThe reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ",?
"When Harry was a baby his parents were killed by EveryoneKnowsWho but as he tried killing Harry he really wasnt able to ",?
"His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him but as he tried killing Harry he couldnt bare to do it and left him a scar the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person ",?
"Once saved and taken the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys and as Harry grows they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies ",?
"Except they dontAs days pass Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesnt know ",?
"He doesnt know who it is and what they want but he knows there is something going on due to the amount of letters being sent ",?
"After getting the chance to open the first one his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him read it and burn it ",?
"He knows he knows who it is and what they want but he doesnt want Harry to know ",?
"But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all letters keep arriving and arriving until the person finally shows up facetoface with The Dursleys and Harry on his th birthdayHes huge introduced as a halfgiant and halfhuman known as Rubeus Hagrid ",?
"Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth telling him he is a wizard and a wellknown one as well ",?
"Hes got talent and has some of the same abilities as his parents ",?
"One being a witch and the other being a wizard Harry is known as a wizard as well ",?
"And as Hagrid tells him the truth Harry does too ",?
"He doesnt know what he is talking about and doesnt know what is going on ",?
"He doesnt believe he is a wizard and doesnt believe the reason for his parents deaths ",?
"But of course Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash for that seemed impossible but they were killed by EveryoneKnowsWho and is the reason for his scarHis aunt finally admitting herself into being a witness of knowing the truth got everything out of her chest and was able to tell him the truth ",?
"She wouldnt even mention her sister because she pretended to not have one ",?
"She was considered perfect and brave while she was nothing and unnoticed ",?
"Nothing has changed but she didnt even bother trying to care care of her niece as her sister is dead protecting Harry from wherever she is ",?
"And as Hagrid tells Harry the rest he actually takes Harry with him even when Mr Dursley forbids him He cant do anything since he is a Muggle and Harry has already been accepted to Hogwarts School and nothing can change ",?
"When Harry leaves with Hagrid they go and buy him what he needs including clothes and supplies for the school ",?
"As they go to the shop he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else ",?
"Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand ",?
"Hes famous his name is everywhere and he can be considered a legend for what happened ",?
"But even with all this going on Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out ",?
"As Harry and Hagrid get what they need its time for Harry to go to school where he meets Ron Weasley as to what I know one of his best friends ",?
"Ron is small redhaired has freckles pale and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him ",?
"Hes not accepted into the other groups and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend ",?
"Harry also meets Hermione Granger known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be ",?
"Of course they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school so I was just like we get it Days pass and Harry is being trained ",?
"Hes a neutral to broomstick flying is able to play Quidditch the most popular game in Hogwarts is given special supplies and is of course known by everyone ",?
"Other than that Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths but in order to do that he must find a way to find them and figure them out ",?
"With the help of his two friends he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard more about his parents history about himself who this YouKnowWho person is remember his past and see how his life really will be changed forever ",?
"Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for themHarry Potter was easy to read understand and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it stars ",?
"Now I hate myself once again and ask myself again Why the fuck did I not read this earlier The answer is obvious because I already know it and its because I was never a fan of it ",?
"I hate speaking about my past but this is one ugly past and I hate it ",?
"I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it ",?
"But soon Ill get over it and will be able to reread this as many times as I will be able to during my last years of being a teen ",?
"Yes a yearold that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young ",?
"PATHETICThe fantasy is cute I will say ",?
"Its easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through ",?
"Its not long its not hard and its not boring ",?
"Its gripping fun and everything is filled with some kind of magical that has me turning page by page ",?
"Having no regrets anywhere I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards where students learn how to make potions talk to ghosts learn about other creatures transform things into other things read minds become invisible fly in the air with a broomstick play soccer in the air have a feast and enjoy it all learn magic have a wand and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses ",?
"Well I guess in mostEverything was fun to read ",?
"I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life ",?
"He was confused but he found out a lot more ",?
"Theres still more but I know that as he grows I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how ",?
"Ill see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness ",?
"Ill be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes ",?
"I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think ",?
"I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger ",?
"I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy ",?
"But more importantly I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like Im on an adventure ",?
"Reading it for the first time feels like one ",?
"Ive never watched the films ",?
"Ive watched parts but skipped them ",?
"Now I wont skip anything ",?
"Its like an adventure where Im dived in and cant seem to leave because Im so alive and intriguedWhat can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said",?
"Nothing ",?
"Reviews are always similar and this one might be too ",?
"Everyone loves it and so did I So will I I should say ",?
" Yes I had trouble pronouncing some names at first but got used to it after ",?
"Yes I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed ",?
"But nothing was boring and even when I rolled my eyes there was a reason for that eye rolling scene ",?
"Maybe it was Hermione being annoying or Draco being a rude boy mocking an adorable redhaired ",?
"Or both ",?
"But I was also laughing ",?
"I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid ",?
"Since the beginning I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious ",?
"I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig ",?
"I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly but thats okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times ",?
"Oh and also Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys I love him ",?
"Hes so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry ",?
"I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry ",?
"He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as bring him a present and giving him another one at the end ",?
"Ron is honestly the cutest ",?
"I dont understand how anyone could be mean to him ",?
"He may be weak but he has his own strengths ",?
"Hes so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him ",?
"There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it but Ill probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know hes still gonna be really mean throughout the series ",?
"Im sure ",?
"I havent spoiled myself so I have no idea how his or anyone elses life goes but I do know that he changes in some way ",?
"Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy ",?
"She hated losing points for her house and because she Ron and Harry were in the same house they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor ",?
"She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with herMalfoy Draco was someone I did not like at all ",?
"Like I said he mocked and made fun of Ron and I hated him for it ",?
"He showed off as well but in the bad way thinking he was really cool just because hes in Slytherin and how used to the wizarding world he is ",?
"He didnt show much care about Harry and his past and would try to get in a fight with Harry while Harry tried fixing the problem ",?
"He payed no attention and took it too far with Harry ",?
"He was a newbie as well so I dont see what the point was ",?
"But the other point is that I dont have expectations for Draco but I hope I dont end up hating him in all books and hope there is some change at least slightly goodThe friendship between Harry Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites ",?
"I know it didnt work out at first and they honestly hated her but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle ",?
"Thanks to the troll she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them ",?
"She didnt yell at them for fighting the troll but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again ",?
"As it was ending she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldnt really figure out what to say ",?
"But also my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning ",?
"It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends and it just made me happy seeing them all together same house same team same classes ",?
"The writing of course is like I said easy to understand ",?
"There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded and there were no problems ",?
"I didnt know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences ",?
"I hear they are kind of the same just that the book provides some more information and detail ",?
"Like always its no surprise ",?
"There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of themOverall I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with now wanting the nd and the rd and the rest ",?
"Really excited to see where this all goes to and how Harry becomes a better wizard ",?
"As wonderful and magical as promised ",?
"Because I didnt remember the movie the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to meI wish Id had this book when I was a kid because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to meAnnes finishing this too and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book As wonderful and magical as promised ",?

"Harry Potter ended up getting on my last nerve in the series but in this book hes crazy likable ",?
"The minor characters are what really make the series though ",?
"They have more personality than the protagonist of most booksThis series might not be the best but theres nothing like it ",?
"Its just magical ",?

"A few years later and with a degree in hand including modules in Childrens Lit I could probably write a better review but people seem to like this oneI really dont like Harry Potter ",?
"Its one of those little concealed but apparently not widely known facts about me which shocks everyone when I say I love books and theyre all yeah rite Harry Potter is so awesum rite and I say no it really isnt I confess when I was eleven or twelve or so I read them ",?
"I also read the Sabrina the Teenage Witch novels ",?
"I read everything and wasnt very discriminating about it ",?
"I did enjoy them ",?
"I continued to enjoy them until I got to Order of the Phoenix and then I decided that all the hype aside I just wasnt interested anymore ",?
"Bear in mind then for the rest of this essay that I have only read up to and including The Goblet of FireCue a few years of irritation while everyone insisted I must read the rest of the books and how dare I prefer Tolkien and Ursula Le Guin and later Susan Cooper ",?
"I have really no objection to people reading the books and enjoying them taking part in the fandom that surrounds them dressing up in witchy costumes to go and pick up the most recently released volume at midnight ",?
"Have fun with that",?
"As far as Im concerned youre welcome to ",?
"Im even quite happy to concede that yes Harry Potter did get more people reading ",?
"Whether it got them reading literature or not is another matter how many people I wonder have discovered a mania for reading after reading Harry Potter and then gone onto the likes of Crime and Punishment and War and Peace or even Lord of the Rings",?
"Not that many Ill bet ",?
"I think theyre probably reading Twilight and the like more often than not ",?
"Not that it matters as long as people are readingBut in any case I Dont ",?
"Have ",?
"To ",?
"Read ",?
"Them ",?
"Just because I like books does not mean I like those books ",?
"And I detest it every time someone shoves them in my face as great literature ",?
"I actually had to study Harry Potter for my English LitLang A Level for those unfamiliar with our system A Levels are exams you take when youre about eighteen which among other things determine whether you can go to university ",?
"One of the questions we had to figure out how to answer was whether we thought Harry Potter was good literature whether we thought it would stand the test of time and how it was suited to the time its currently inIt was then that I figured out that yeah there are things wrong with Harry Potter beyond just the hype that was irritating me so much and the feeling that Rowling in no way matched up to the giants of fantasy and scifi like Tolkien ",?
"I studied it alongside Tom Browns Schooldays by Thomas Hughes ",?
"Do note that I didnt like that book either ",?
"But its a well written well shaped well considered book and it doesnt use the same cheap tricks as Harry Potter does ",?
"Im not going to say much about that since its not a book I liked if Im going to comparecontrast Ill compare with my favourite book that is also supposed to be for younger readers Susan Coopers The Dark Is RisingTheres nothing wrong with Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone being an amateur first novel ",?
"cause thats what it is ",?
"Im sure many peoples first novels dont even see the light of day and yet Harry Potter somehow made it to a publishers and was accepted ",?
"The thing is people mostly refuse to recognise that and the cheap tricks J K Rowling uses ",?
"For example her characters names ",?
"Draco Malfoy ",?
"Mal the French for bad immediately obvious ",?
"Draco suggesting dragon",?
"Or perhaps draconian which has negative connotations aplenty not that Id necessarily attribute those particular ones to Draco ",?
"Not very subtle is it",?
"Dumbledore ",?
"Who doesnt get the image of a wellmeaning if strange old man",?
"Minerva straight out of Greek myth a goddess of knowledge ",?
"Gee I wonder why Rowling chose that for a female teacher ",?
"Remus Lupin Sirius Black MadEye Moody ",?
"Do I even have to say anythingAnd Harry Potter ",?
"Nothing striking about that perfectly ordinary as names go rightYeah ",?
"And thats the point ",?
"Harry Potter himself is not a real character certainly not at first ",?
"Hes a cypher a convenient space into which a kid can very easily insert himself or even herself ",?
"Hes brave ",?
"Okay generic hero characteristic ",?
"He has doubts ",?
"Again the same ",?
"He has a Tragic Past ",?
"Dont we all",?
"Or dont we all like to think we do",?
"Look at the Mary Suesself inserts people write in fandom so often theyre people with incredibly dark melodramatic pasts that they rise above ",?
"Harry Potter is a convenient place to insert yourself ",?
"The other characters are archetypes more than anything Hermione the know it all girl Ron the loyal friend Dumbledore the mentor Malfoy the rivalAll of that is actually what makes Harry Potter a highly readable enjoyable book for young people and even adults ",?
"Its targeted very precisely toward the readership of today ",?
"Maybe that makes J K Rowling a better author than I might paint her as that she can know her audience so well theres that view Im sure ",?
"But its all very basic and I tend to look on it as cheap tricks ",?
"The whole chapter in the first book about the Mirror of Erised how sad does it make you feel for Harry",?
"Its sentimental its sad and its meant to do that very obviously ",?
"Theres a whole chapter written just to enforce the love between the members of Harry Potters familySusan Cooper does it in a single paragraph that makes me want to cry every single time I read it coming after all the build up of guilt and pain in the relationship ",?
"Bran went to his father and put his arm round his waist and stood close ",?
"It was the first gesture of affection between the two that Will had ever seen ",?
"And wondering loving surprise woke in Owen Daviess worn face as he looked down at the boys white head and the two stood there waitingThat paragraph does for me what Rowlings whole chapter cannot ",?
"Its so effective actually because Cooper spends a whole book leading up to it showing us Owen and Brans relationship ",?
"Rowling shows us Harrys parents but in an unsubtle way that actually throws me out of it because I think Oh yeah this is the chapter in which were supposed to feel very sorry for HarryTheres also a very easy blunt misdirection ",?
"Youre supposed to hate Snape supposed to believe hes the one to blame for everything and at the end youre supposed to be as surprised as Harry when its Quirrel waiting there for him ",?
"At the age of eleven I think I went right along with that but when I reread it for A Level I had to wince at how heavyhanded the misdirection was ",?
"I understand that later in the series Snape comes into it more and I dont know whether the misdirection turns out to be not that misdirected when it comes down to the real truth but in the first book youre meant to believe its Snape all along and I dont think J K Rowling does a very good job of giving us clues that its not actually Snape because shes so busy blackening him to lead people astrayIts also very blackandwhite ",?
"Questions arent raised by this story and thats a thing I think is actually important in literature ",?
"Raise questions discuss issues end with a question ",?
"I dont know what to call stories that dont fit into that really ",?
"Im going to go with novels as opposed to literature ",?
"Harry Potter is a novel ",?
"Its a story ",?
"I dont think it has any real lasting values ",?
"Susan Coopers books while also quite basic discussing the Light and the Dark do end with a question ",?
"If man is left on earth to do as man will will man be Light or Dark",?
"The immortals leave earth and say that the world for better or worse belongs to humans ",?
"Right now a lot of people think the answer to that question would be worse ",?
"But Harry Potter does not raise this question does not raise any question and does not answer one either ",?
"Thats why I dont think it will last except perhaps as a phenomenon to be studied the Potter mania and what caused itThats why I dont like Rowlings writing ",?
"Its not particularly refined its unsubtle and thats okay you know Im not saying you cant enjoy that cant find it refreshing ",?
"I dont ",?
"Im also not saying that novels are bad theyre good they can provide valuable escapism they can be incredibly rich fodder for the imagination and I suspect Harry Potter is for many children ",?
"But I dont call it literature and I myself dont like itNote the three star rating is because honestly when I first read it I did love it ",?

"But as a child I was intimidated by how thick the books were including the first installment which also happens to be one of the more shorter books in the series",?
"Its a funny thought now considering how I read books even more than double the size of Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone ",?
"But last year I made a resolution to read all the Harry Potter books starting in January and finishing no later than April because Universal Studios is finally opening The Wizarding World of Harry Potter theme park in California ",?
"And what better way to reward myself for finishing the series than taking a journey through the magical world of Harry Potter",?
"Chocolate Frogs Bertie Botts Butter Beer Hogwarts HERE I COMEWith that being said I really enjoyed this book as much as I thought I would ",?
"I loved seeing all the bonus scenes and dialogue that were excluded from the film and how different everything seemed as opposed to watching the films ",?
"However I think I did enjoy the movie a bit more than the book ",?
"Maybe its because I grew up watching the Harry Potter movies and still do several times every year rather than growing up and reading the books ",?
"So if anything its actually kind of backwards for meIve noticed that the movie took on a more darker atmosphere compared to the lighter more kidfriendly mood that the book possessed ",?
"A good example of this for me would be the Sorting Hat scene ",?
"In the movie the Hat actually frightened and freaked me out and to be honest it still does",?
"But in the book everyones all happy and singing and just WAY different from how I wouldve pictured it if I would have read the book first then watched the movie ",?
"PIm really glad that the movie did such a fantastic job at depicting this book and in some ways made it even better ",?
"I thought I already knew the Wizarding World like the back of my hand but after reading Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone it opened my eyes to a whole new perception that the movies could never have given me ",?
"Although being a fan isnt determined by whether or not youve read all the books or watched all the movies Im really proud of myself for finally tackling this once childhood fear of mine to read the Harry Potter series ",?
"And for me it feels as if Im kicking it up a notch as a Harry Potter fanatic whos seen the movies and is finally one step closer to finishing the books ",?

"youve done something magical ",?
"If it were only for small things I dont think this would bother me so much but the same works for more serious things like killing someoneThere is so much that is contrary to logic and I dont mean science I mean how reasonable people would behave in the magic of Harry Potter that it drives me crazy ",?
"Why is the magical world so separated from the real world",?
"What is their interaction",?
"If magic works in the muggle world what is preventing someone like Voldemort from completely taking over the muggle world",?
"What is preventing any character from killing any other character by simpling saying the killing curse at any time",?

"Obviously there are a lot of characters in the books that dont have any ",?
"This never made any sense to meI would like to draw a comparison with and Im sure people on a site about reading books will crucify me for mentioning TV which is obviously incapable of being an art form Buffy the Vampire Slayer ",?
"In Buffy every time you use magic you pay for it ",?
"For little things like floating a pencil you pay for it in concentration and maybe a little physical energy but not more than going for a walk ",?
"However the more you take the more you have to give back in one form or another ",?
"The show is not always entirely consistent on this but the idea makes sense ",?
"To bring someone back from the dead you have to kill something else or pay some other kind of price ",?
"If you want to kill someone there is a physical price a mental price ",?
"Nothing is free ",?

"She adopts Rouald Dahls awful family trope though its clear that Rowling does not have the gift of bizarre characterization or the knowledge of the darker parts of the human soul that made his books resonateShe writes sympathetic characters but not unusual ones ",?
"Overall her writing has relatively little character or style ",?
"Then again mass success often requires leaving the more unusual s behind ",?
"So she relies on standard character types managing to keep them afloat through the patented perpetual plot of the airplane bookShe also pulls from that old British tradition of children lost in fairyland seen often in early fantasy Dunsany Eddison which Lewis also made use of ",?
"She also has the vast unknown underground of magic just beneath our world which keeps itself always mysterious and quiet much favored by Gaiman and other Urban Fantasy authors though Rowlings invented world is strained and piecemeal moreso as the series goes onThe strength of the book is that it combines the tradition of the child in fairyland with another British standby the boarding school bildungsroman ",?
"Its the same neat trick Mervyn Peake pulled in Gormenghast though Rowlings version is tame in comparison ",?
"Her tale of the intellectual emotional and physical growth of the young outcast everyman is rather predictable except for some insight into angst in the fifth bookRowlings prose is quick and simple but sometimes awkward and without music or joy ",?
"It is not the sort of deliberate simplicity Carroll achieved by expressing complex ideas in playful terms ",?
"It is rather the sign of an author whose unsophisticated voice prevents her language from vaulting higherSimplistic elegance is deceptively difficult to achieve and so its hard to blame Rowling too much when she falters ",?
"Its unfortunate that she didnt put a few failed books under her belt before finding success as such early outings are often best winnowed chaffHer plottingas everis scattered and convenient though in a shorter book it shows less ",?
"Her plot twists as usual disappoint they are not built upon progression of events but upon reader expectation and emotional red herringsIts the beginning of an enjoyable series but theres really no need to start any earlier than the third book when Rowling finally finds her pace and begins to lean more heavily on that which she does well which helps to hide her faults ",?

"Then I stumbled across Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone in my school libraryWhat the hell Id thought ",?

"When we spilled out the content together there were books and Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets was among themYou see when I was first introduced to Harry Potter I did not start with The Sorcerers Stone as I should have but instead the starter book for me was The Chamber of Secrets My sister was a bit of a noob at book buying ",?
"She didnt realize she bought the second book instead of the first ",?
"I remembered thinking how VERY ODD and UNIQUE this world of witchcraft wizardry was ",?
"And believe me Ive read some strange stuffs before Harry Potter came into the pictureI knew I had missed out on a few details from the first book but Ive watched the movies and they were enough to provide me the information I needed to knowHeres where the plot twist come to play right after I was done with The Chamber of Secrets I extinguished Harry Potter out of my mind ",?

"I still love every single moment as much as I had the first time around ",?
"I still found The Dursleys reaction to magic hilariously comical Hermiones and Rons banters are adorable and riproaringly funny at times oh they were so meant to be and I enjoyed JKRowlings ability to weave up an entire new bizarre world with its own set systems and good lord her food description is absolutely fantastic ",?
"My mouth waters even at the thought of Chocolate Frogs Pumpkin Juice Butterbeer and every single meals the house elves at Hogwarts have to offer ",?

"I dont know if it was the cover or the instapopularity of the books or what but I didnt read them ",?
"I avoided them like the plague ",?
"Until a friend of mine was reading the th book and was so engrossed in it that he would do the yes yes Im paying attention nod while his eyes remained glued to the page ",?
"And as a reader myself I know that look ",?
"So I asked to borrow the book he was reading and he refused ",?

"Theres something about these books that is just ",?
"magical ",?
"Yeah yeah cliche I know ",?
"But its true ",?
"Yes they are about magic but they are about so much more than that ",?
"They are about love and friendship and loyalty and trust and betrayal and commitment and all the things that we aspire to have and to be as humans ",?

"Learning doesnt have to be boring and tedious it can be fun if we allow it to be ",?
"But it seems that weve lost that ability ",?
"Sad ",?
"Anyway I reread the first book now appropriately titled Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone and I was surprised at how emotional I felt reading it especially after knowing where it all ends ",?

"Thats kind of a silly way to feel because they are forever and I can visit anytime I want to but I felt that way anyway ",?
"Especially meeting Ron again ",?
"Hes my favorite character for an absolute reason which is because he is so loyal and funny and true and he gives his whole heart when he gives it at all ",?

"It had movies and everyone loved themDo you know what she did",?
"She promised herself she would never read them ",?
"She had already watched the movies the ones that were out and she rather liked them but she would not touch the books because doing so would mean she was just like everyone else and she was special yeah I was that arrogantSome years laterOctober th It was a gray day and it was her brothers birthday ",?
"Mother wanted to gift his son something that he would enjoy but not videogames or stuff like that ",?
"She wanted something with more educational value say a bookMother knew Vanessas brother liked the HP movies up until the sixth one and as there was a book fair at his school which was mine too and the books upon which the movies were based were there ",?
"She bought the first and gave it to his son for his birthdaySome of her mothers friend had also given Vanessas brother several of the other boks in the series ",?
"It seemed as if they had planned the whole thingOf course Vanessa thought there was a hidden purpose there ",?
"She thought her mother had bought the books so she wouldnt resist on picking them I told you I was arrogant didnt IShe was wrong ",?
"That was not her mothers purpose but in the end Vanessa couldnt resist the pull ",?
"She wanted and didnt want to read the booksWanted them for some reasonsUB She had always been intrigued by themUB She was the reader in the house ",?
"She couldnt stand the fact that her brother who hated and still hates reading was going to read more books than her dont even tell meUB A friend of hers was bragging she had read the HP books in less than one week and she wanted to prove her she could do the sameDidnt want them for some reasonsUB Reading them would mean she was a common girl I was an insufferable yearold girl dont blame meUB She would break her promise if she read themUB If she read them she would do what everyone else wanted her to do and as you know she hates being told what to doAfter a long time of deep philosophizing aka one day she decided she would read them ",?
"What could be the worst thing to happenIt turns out she loved the first book ",?
"Her reaction upon starting it was something like thisAfter that she wanted the next ones ",?
"She borrowed the books from his brother and read them all up to the th one those were the ones we had in one week ",?
"She felt sorry for not doing it any soonerYeah I was and still am like that ",?

"The novel begins at the small quiet house on Number Four Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey where the books eleven yearold protagonist Harry Potter lives in the cupboard under the stairs ",?
"He was orphaned at a young age after his parents were killed in a tragic accident and was sent to live with the Dursleys Aunt Petunia Uncle Vernon and their son Dudley ",?
"His only living relatives treat him poorly making Harrys childhood miserableHarrys unhappy demeanor is replaced by one of elation when he receives a letter inviting him to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry the finest school for witches and wizards in all of Britain ",?
"As the novel unfolds Harry begins his first year at Hogwarts where he is introduced to the wizarding world befriends other students and comes facetoface with adversity ",?
"The twists and turns mounting suspense and thrilling perils that Harry encounters render this book lifechangning and unforgettableRowling has a rare talent for creating believable realistic characters that gradually change as the story progresses ",?
"These characters as some people would say possess a certain amount of depth ",?
"Their unique personalities and traits distinguish them from the characters in similar novels ",?
"Harry embodies all of the characteristics of a true hero courage tenacity and an inclination to protect others ",?
"Harry is willing to sacrifice everything including his own life to ensure the safety of others ",?
"Rowling accurately captures his desire to protect those he loves whatever the costI must admit Rowlings imagination is extraordinary ",?

"Rowlings creative prowess enabled her to establish an entirely new world filled with realistic people magical creatures and thrilling enchantments ",?
"The wizarding world was crafted so thoroughly that it is flawless ",?
"No minor detail of this alternate world was excluded allowing readers to fully immerse themselves in the bookAs the plot unfolded readers received a glimpse of the growing complexity of the series ",?
"Rowling introduced specific details throughout the novel which the majority of readers overlook ",?
"These seemingly insignificant details however have a large impact upon later events within the book ",?
"My predictions of the events to come were quite far from the actual events that transpired ",?
"The shocking conclusion left me stunned and begging my mother to drive me to Barnes and Noble to purchase the second bookWhile Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone falls under the Fantasy genre Rowling discretely incorporated many mythological and historical references into the novel especially those pertaining to the works of Ancient Rome ",?
"First and foremost among these allusions is Hagrids threeheaded dog Fluffy ",?
"The concept of such a creature is taken from Greek Mythology according to legend Cerberus a threeheaded dog ferociously guarded the entrance to the Underworld ",?
"The only means of subduing Cerberus and Fluffy consequently is the playing of a lyre ",?
"Additionally the Hogwarts motto Draco Dormiens Nunquam Titillandus is Latin for Never tickle a sleeping dragon Rowling relies heavily on her knowledge of Latin to create incantations and character names throughout the seriesI am most impressed not with the books themselves but with the author whose ragstoriches life story has inspired countless people worldwide ",?
"JK Rowling was born Joanne Kathleen Rowling into a poor family living in Gloucestershire England ",?
"She was accepted at the University of Exeter where she studied Classics ",?
"She was devastated when her mother died shortly after her graduation having suffered from multiple sclerosis ",?
"Several years later Rowling married Jorge Arantes and gave birth to their daughter Jessica ",?
"The unhappy couple separated months after their marriage ",?
"Homeless penniless and caring for a newborn Rowling struggled with depression and contemplated suicide ",?
"We almost lost the brilliant talented mind who is solely responsible for the series that has now become a worldwide phenomenon ",?
"Her rags to riches story inspires millions of people in similar situations ",?
"Despite her challenges Rowlings perseverance and determination brought the world of Harry Potter to lifeOverall this series is the most memorable from my childhood ",?
"I was originally introduced to the series in third grade and immediately fell in love with the realistic characters suspenseful plot and flawless writing style ",?
"I was the diehard fan who watched each movie a dozen times at the same movie theater eventually coming to know the employees at the concessions stand on a first name basis ",?
"For Halloween last year in fact I dressed up in an old pair of robes pulled on a wig and drew a scar on my forehead ",?
"And to this day I find myself reciting quotes from the series ",?
"I was crushed after the release of the final book feeling that part of my childhood had ended with the series ",?
"Looking back I have never once regretted the time I have spent reading and rereading the series committing it to memory ",?
"The Harry Potter series has served as more than a way to pass the time it has helped to shape the person I am todayTheres a decent chance you wont like this book ",?
"Lets be honest here ",?
"If youre reading my reviews and havent read this series youre probably an adult which means two things ",?
"One is that you have lived through this series releasing novels movies and becoming a cultural phenomenon ",?

"you arent eleven years old ",?
"This book is written for children ",?
"Yes the books get darker and more mature and much better later on but this one is for middle school aged kidsThis is my first time rereading book in at least years ",?
"This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book ",?
"The main characters are dumb the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment and in order for some events to make any sense one has to create their own headcanon ",?
"Typically at such points I stop remind myself that this is a childrens book and get a glass of Makers But forgive them I do ",?
"Rowling creates a fantastic world characters and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it ",?
"If I were reading this for the first time today I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me ",?
"But I do know that having read the rest of the series it didnt even cross my mind not to finish this reread despite seeing all of the problems ",?
"The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry so while we never get adult novels we do get much better writing in later books ",?
"If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off I encourage you to keep going for another couple of booksAs a final note my rating for this book is for the series ",?

"Because this book ",?

"This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book ",?
"The main characters are dumb the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment and in order for some events to make any sense one has to create their own headcanon ",?
"Typically at such points I stop remind myself that this is a childrens book and get a glass of Makers But forgive them I do ",?
"Rowling creates a fantastic world characters and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it ",?
"If I were reading this for the first time today I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me ",?
"But I do know that having read the rest of the series it didnt even cross my mind not to finish this reread despite seeing all of the problems ",?
"The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry so while we never get adult novels we do get much better writing in later books ",?
"If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off I encourage you to keep going for another couple of booksAs a final note my rating for this book is for the series ",?

"The plot felt a little badlystitched together in some places as if theyd be written separately and then threaded together later ",?
"There were a few eyeroll moments and some really ridiculous moments but there were also some lovely moments great characters Id forgotten about and overall a nice flow to how it all panned outThe thing Im most looking forward to is the development of Hermione ",?
"I dont really like Harry all that much and Ron is just one of those oh youre here characters to me and my favourite Luna wont be turning up for another four books or so although I didnt remember that Hermione had been purposefully described as Bossy and Im so excited to see how she changes in the books ",?

"This is where it all began where we were introduced to Harry Potter Rowlings magical world a series of exciting adventures and the excellent characters and environments she has given to English literature ",?
"It set the standard for contemporary fantasy ",?
"Rowling make full use of classic literary and mythological references freeing herself from the confines of the merely topical while giving it all a daring sense of newness ",?
"This series will live foreverThe number of times Ive read this book has gotten out of hand and yet I can never get tired of reading Harry PotterAlthough I believe I should mark this as my first time reading the books in English all the previous times has been the translated version ",?
"Its like a whole other world",?
"Almost as if Im reading the book for the first timeNon cUE bisogno di dire niente se non magicoWownggak kerasa sudah tahun sejak saya kenalan sama Harry Potter dan terpesona pada dunia buatan Madame Rowling ini ",?
"Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review tapi sebelum itu rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir iniSaya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah sekitar akhir ",?

"Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review tapi sebelum itu rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir iniSaya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah sekitar akhir ",?
"Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilihmilih buku bekas ketika shopkeepernya menawari saya buku ini ",?
"Dia berpromosi kalo ini buku bagus banget dan sayang banget kalo ampe gak saya beli ",?
"Dia juga bilang kalo Harry Potter ini lagi happening banget di Inggris sanaWaktu itu saya kenal internet cuma sebatas email dan chatting doang gak pernah browsing ",?
"Saya pun bukan tipe yang langganan majalah ato koran jadi saya benarbenar gak tahu kalo ada buku berjudul Harry Potter yang lagi booming ",?
"Saya malah curiga kalo buku ini adalah buku jelek yang gak laku ",?
"Ya logikanya aja kalo emang tuh buku buagus banget kok udah ada yang jual secondnya di Bras Basah",?
"Dan kalo emang laris buanget kenapa juga si shopkeeper maksamaksa saya buat beli",?
"Tebakan saya sih ini buku gak laku dan si shopkeeper mo nepu saya Ohhow stupid I wasAkhirnya buku Harry Potter itu saya beli juga karena sang shopkeeper menjamin saya boleh tukar dengan buku lain kalo nggak puas ",?
"Dan begitulah awalnya saya kenal sama Harry PotterRasanya saya gak perlu menulis sinopsis buku ini ato bahkan memberi tahu buku ini termasuk dalam genre apa ",?
"I mean seriously",?
"Sudah tahun lebih sejak demam Harry Potter melanda dunia its been all over the news ",?
"Kalo bahkan ampe detik ini Anda nggak tahu garis besar cerita Harry Potter berarti Anda emang gak berminat sama buku ini ",?
"Then why bothers now",?
"Jadi lebih baik saya membahas apa yang saya rasakan sewaktu membaca kembali buku ini setelah tahun berlaluYang pertama saya rasa sih auranya yang beda ",?
"Sewaktu pertama baca Harry Potter dulu temanteman saya gak ada yang ngeh sama buku ini yah sebenernya ampe sekarang temen saya yang baca buku ini juga sedikit sih ",?
"Jadi saya heboh sendiri bahas buku ini sendirian dan dapat tatapan loengomongapasih dari temanteman bahkan fangirling pun sendirian kasian ",?
"Sekarang ini berkat GR dan BBI saya jadi kenal banyak orang yang juga ngefans sama Harry Potter bahkan ampe baca bareng ",?
"Jelas vibenya beda banget ",?
"Dan itu menyenangkan ",?
"Horeeeeesaya masuk golongan mainstream heheYang kedua saya mengubah pandangan saya tentang Harry di buku pertama ",?
"Awal baca dulu saya beranggapan Harry ini kepo banget ",?
"Kenapa sih pusing banget sama kemungkinan Sorcerer Stone dicuri sama Voldemort",?
"Kenapa gak kirim Hedwig aja ke Dumbledore sih buat warning itu adalah pertanyaan saya duluSekarang saya ngerti kenapaSeperti yang dibilang Harry Dumbledore tahu bahwa Harry butuh untuk mencoba melawan karena pertarungan dengan Voldemort itu personal untuk Harry ",?
"Gimana pun Voldemort lah yang membunuh orangtua Harry ",?
"Dan Harry sadar kalo Voldemort bisa kembali menyerang diaTapi terutama karena Harry sadar bahwa kembalinya Voldemort dapat membuat dia kehilangan dunia sihirHe was nothing in the muggle world ",?
"Gak punya siapa pun dan apa pun ",?
"Lalu dia menemukan semuanya di dunia sihir sahabat kebahagiaan dan terutama penerimaan ",?
"Penerimaan yang tak pernah dia dapatkan sebelumnya ",?
"Gak heran kalo Harry berkeras mempertahankannya ",?
"Id do the same if I were him ",?
"Id fight the nastiest wizard if I have to in order not to let something most precious being taken from me ",?
"So I could understand Harrys determination to fight Voldemort even when hes still a kidKetiga ternyata saya sudah suka Ron dari buku ke XJangan salah dari trio itu Ron memang favorit saya kok ",?
"Saya suka Ron karena kalimatnya yang witty dan rada sarkastis belum lagi sindirannya yang tajam ",?
"Tapi kualitas itu baru keliatan di buku kedua ato malah ketiga ",?
"Yang pasti bukan di buku pertamaDulu saya gak ngerti apa yang bikin saya bersimpati sama Ron sejak awal ",?
"Sekarang saya tahu ",?
"Karena Ron orang pertama yang menerima Harry ",?
"Dia gak meremehkan Harry seperti yang dilakukan Malfoy tapi dia juga gak memujanya secara berlebihan ",?
"Dia menganggap Harry sama normalnya dengan dia and thats enoughKeempat saya makin kagum dengan persahabatan Ron dan Hermione ",?
"Theyre true bestfriendsTanpa ragu Ron dan Hermione menemani Harry untuk melawan Voldemort walopun mereka tahu resikonya ",?
"I mean saya ngerti kesetiaan Ron dan Hermione pada Harry di buku ke ",?
"Theyve come a long way ",?
"Tapi di buku ",?
"Saat mereka baru kenal tahun kurang serta belum ngeh seberapa parah kondisinya kalo Voldemort kembali berkuasa",?
"Thats greatKelima perubahan karakter Neville kerasa banget ya ",?
"Neville yang penakut dan gak berani membela dirinya sungguh berbeda dengan Neville di buku ke ",?
"I forgot how awkward clumsy and shy Neville was ",?
"But lets talk about him on the later bookKeenam wowpenerjemah Harry Potter ini keren sekali yaSaya sudah pernah sih baca versi Inggris dan terjemahan buku ini untuk reread yang ini saya baca versi Inggrisnya lagi dan dari dulu memang saya tahu penerjemahnya emang canggih ",?
"Tapi baru sekarang saya benarbenar ngehMirror of Erised diterjemahkan Cermin Tarsah ",?
"Erised yang merupakan anagram dari desire diterjemahkan jadi tarsah yang anagram dari hasrat ",?
"Wow",?
"Dan setelah saya googling saya dapat info kalo sebenarnya ide Tarsah ini baru kepikir belakangan menjelang bukunya turun cetak ",?
"Karena sang penerjemah berkeras mesti ada padanan yang tepat untuk erised ",?
"Dan iya beliau emang bener karena erised dan tarsah adalah padanan yang cocokKetujuh hmmsaya tetap gak ngerti kenapa Professor Quirrell gak bisa menyentuh Harry hanya di bagian akhir buku ini",?
"Waktu awal cerita Harry bertemu Prof Quirrell di Diagon Alley dan saat itu mereka sudah berjabat tangan ",?
"Kok saat itu tangan si Quirrell gak melepuh ya",?
"Padahal sudah jelas kalo Voldemort telah nebeng di tubuh Quirrell saat ituKedelapan saya makin kagum deh sama JK RowlingOkesaya tahu kalo JKR emang banyak menggunakan bantuan mitos legenda ato apalah itu dalam ceritanya ",?
"So its not really original ",?
"Tapi toh emang gak ada formula yang benarbenar baru ",?
"Yang penting sih gimana Rowling bisa meramu bahan yang ada ",?
"And shes really good at itTapi yang sebenarnya keren dari Rowling adalah dia benarbenar paham karakter pembacanyaI guess in some points of our life even if its just for one time we ever felt like Harry whos a misfit and wishing to go to some place new where we could start everything from the scratch or becoming a different people ",?
"But not everyone could do that ",?
"Apparently Harry is one of those lucky peopleReading Harrys journey gave me happiness ",?
"Happiness that comes from knowing that at least theres one person in this world who could fulfill his dreams ",?
"It also gave me some hopes that in the end everything will be fine for me too ",?
"If this boy whose life was much more miserable than me finally found what he always wanted how could I not",?
"Dan Rowling juga dengan cerdasnya memilih setting di Inggris suatu tempat yang masih bisa terjangkau dan karenanya masih terasa dekat ",?
"Bukannya tempat jauh antah berantah seperti di Middle Earth sana atau dunia magic namun tak terjangkau seperti Abarat ",?
"Terlibatnya kaum manusia non sihir aka muggle juga tempattempat di Inggris seperti stasiun Kings Cross membuat cerita ini makin terasa dekat di hati membuat kita okesebenernya sih saya berani berharap bahwa suatu saat nanti saya juga bisa dapatehemsurat saya sendiri ",?
"Seorang teman saya bahkan sampe mencoba menekan pilar di tempat yang semestinya jadi peron waktu dia lagi ada di Kings Cross dan waktu salah seorang petugas di sana melihat kelakuan teman saya si petugas bilang Youre not the first person who tried looking for that platform Bhahakternyata banyak yang bermimpi ke Hogwarts eh",?
"Dan alasan kenapa saya kasih bintang walopun saya mengakui kalo cerita di buku ini masih kalah spekta dibanding bukubuku berikutnyaKarena ini adalah buku pertama ",?
"The one that started it all ",?
"Buku ini juga yang bikin saya kenal dan jadi langganan sampe sekarang sama sebuah toko di Bras Basah itu ",?
"Its always nice to find a new friend because of one certain bookLastly just wanna say this for you all who feel like you dont fit in who wished for a magical school or secret garden or magical cupboard that could open secret passage to magical land and still secretly keeping those wish alive keep on wishing ",?
"Keep on hoping ",?
"Who knows maybe your letter is on its way now Ive honestly read this book so many times I find it kind of boring ",?

"So I have read this particular book no less than times no hyperbole in that statement I swearThis is my review of the illustrated version which I found to be an absolute gem and a must own for all Harry Potter fanatics such as myself ",?
"Before I share some photos of my favorite illustrations here are some thoughts about the overall book This may be one of those things that is more of a collectors item versus an essential book for reading ",?
"It was fun and offered me a whole different experience to reading the book in general but Im not so sure I would be so quick to pick it up again for pure reading purposes ",?
"It is very large and heavy ",?
"It is awkward to hold and can be difficult to read if you do your reading in bed guilty ",?
"Like I mentioned it enhances the reading experience but not completely essential to enjoying the book ",?
"Now I dont have kids and the last picture book I read was Berenstein Bears ",?
"I did personally find the images to be on the darker side and more wacky and whimsical instead of soft and childlike whatever that means ",?
"I feel like these illustrations may appeal to more adults than kids but I dont read to kids before bed or even know what kids like ",?
"I dont even have the faintest idea who Jim Kay illustrates for so take that tidbit with a grain of salt ",?
"Here are some of my favorite illustrations so enjoy",?
"The house in the middle of the ocean ",?
"Harry and Hagrid ",?
"Diagon Alley ",?
"Hogwarts Express full version of the cover ",?
"Some insanely cool ghosts ",?

"Its something thats almost impossible to realize here in the first one and that I still appreciate each and every time I pick up this seriesWhen I first picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone I had no idea the impact it would have on my life ",?
"It was just a story about a boy that finds out hes a wizard and has to fight the forces of evil ",?
"Thats what I thought when I started it that first time ",?
"Very quickly I was drawn into the world of magic that JK Rowling penned surrounded by witches and wizards magic and muggles ",?
"When I try to examine my feelings for this and all future books I run into the problem of not being able to quantify what makes it so special ",?
"The story is a classic boy finds out hes special learns about world fights evil wins ",?
"The world is intricate and fun with a lot of cleverness plays on words simple ciphers and logic puzzles made me smile while still being straightforward ",?
"The characters though varied and threedimensional are fairly standardAnd yet this all combines into this wonderful fantastical world that pulls me in and makes me wonder whats hiding behind that brick wall over there or what I might be missing out of the corner of my eyeI remember distinctly the feeling of sorrow that I had upon finishing this first book and realizing I was already too old to get a letter to Hogwarts ",?
"The world is so enchanting that I cant help but want to be a part of it ",?
"Its all about the feeling that it evokes in me ",?
"It makes me feel like theres magic in the world and its not necessarily the turnamouseintoasnuffbox type of magic or the type where the chess pieces actually fight each other though how awesome would that be ",?
"Its the type where friendship is stronger than anything that gets thrown at it ",?
"Where people kids can fight against injustice and wrong and win ",?
"It lets you know that life isnt always fair and that you might have to battle against things that are scary and horrible but the happiness at the end is always worth itAnd I suppose thats what keeps me coming back time and time again to reread revisit and relive this story ",?
"It makes me feel a part of something amazingAnd that is definitely magicalReview also available at The Book EatersHarry Potter holds a foreverplace in my heart ",?

"Hes brave selfsacrificing and honorable ",?
"I think Harry proves his own character and addresses the books central theme itself in a scene he shares with Malfoy near the beginning of his time at Hogwarts ",?
"In this particular scene Malfoy gives a snotty little spiel on how he can introduce Harry to the best wizarding families and help him stay away from the wrong sort Harry then refuses to shake Malfoys hand and responds I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself thanks And isnt that the essence of growing up",?
"Moving away from simply doing what others tell us to do and learning to discern right and wrong for ourselves",?
"Then as soon as we know whats right we can work on growing strong enough to stand up for it regardless of who stands against us ",?
"Harry is brilliant",?
"Almost as brilliant as his author whos created a story that is both wonderful and wonderfully told ",?
"BravoMEGS FAVORITE QUOTES and of course Dumbledore says most of themScars can come in handyHarry wished he had about eight more eyes ",?
"The very dust and silence seemed to tingle with some secret magicFrom that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend ",?

"I had such a great time reading this book ",?

"Which character would I get to see next",?
"How much color or detail would there be",?

"Not every page had an official illustration on it but every page had a little something extra included that made it a treat to look at whether the page looked marbled or had mysterious looking splotches on it ",?
"But even when there were full color illustrations on a page I was able to use my imagination just as well as if there hadnt been any at all ",?

"httpwwwtelegraphcoukbookswhatBut getting back to the story which I havent even talked about yet what I liked best about it were the growing bonds between the characters the slippery lines between good and evil the many forms in which bravery appeared the hope and optimism stirring in the hearts and minds of the characters even when all seemed lost and finally the magic woven within this book which had nothing to do with the spells cast ",?
"I dont know why I waited so long to begin this series but in a way Im glad I did just so I could kick off reading it with this very special edition ",?
"I wish I could wait to read all the books in this form but no way",?

"Im sure there is some sort of answer for this one I had just never thought of it beforeI want Mrs Weasley to knit me a sweaterThe Mirror of Eriseds inscription backwards says I show not your face but your hearts desireIn the book when Harry first finds the Mirror of Erised he sees a reflection of his mom dad and the rest of his family ",?

"I got to enjoy the story like it was meant to be enjoyed so I know more than a few of you Potter fans wish you were me right now and got to fall in love with this series for the first timeWhat can I say",?
"While reading this I felt simultaneously transported back in time and into another worldThe world was filled with magic and mythical creatures and the time was when I was eleven years old and filled with imagination and wonder ",?
"Ive read my fair share of childrens books but Ive never read one that so perfectly captured the feeling of how wonderful and freeing it is to be a child ",?
"I loved the moments when Harry Ron and Hermoine got to play eat sweets and find mischief like normal kids just as much as I liked the moments when they were learning magic and fighting monsters ",?
"Even the most mundane activities were written in such a wistful and intriguing way that I was afraid to miss a single word ",?
"Usually if I my eyes glaze over I just keep reading until I get caught up but that was impossible to do with this book ",?
"I was scared that if I looked away for even a moment I might miss something ",?
"When the story began I hated the Dursleys with such a passion ",?
"A group of more miserable and hateful people has never been found ",?
"After a while I had to remind myself to chill out because things were going to get better for Harry eventually ",?
"And thats the only way I made it though those first chapters without throwing my book across the room ",?
"But something happened when Harry met Rons mom for the first time ",?
"I was so relieved when she was sweet and motherly towards him that I realized why the Dursleys had to be so terrible ",?
"There are plenty of mean and horrible people Harry has to deal with but those bad people make the friends Harry meets seem all the more wonderful ",?
"After I realized how necessary the villains were to the story I started to enjoy them more ",?
"When Harry and the gang got in trouble instead of just feeling dread and worrying about them I also looked forward to seeing how they were going to get out of their current scrape ",?
"There was a chemistry between all the characters in this book that was such a pleasure ",?
"Harry is an innocent and heroic little boy who is lucky to have a loyal and brave friend like Ron and Hermione is the smart mother hen ",?
"She worries about them both tells them when their ideas are stupid and then goes along to keep them out of trouble ",?
"And Dumbledore is insanely funny it only took two scenes for me to fall in love with him and wish he was my crazy greatuncle ",?
"I honestly cant think of a thing I didnt love about this book ",?
"I even loved the names",?
"Sir Nicholas de MimsyPorpington is the best name in the history of names and I will never refer to him as UCHeadless NickUD Everything was so well thought out and planned and there were more than a few surprising moments that I never saw coming ",?
"I am so glad that I waited as long as I did to read this ",?
"I have always liked to read but when I was a kid I didnt love it the way I do now ",?
"I finally know why everyone loves this book so much ",?
"Its not because it is the greatest piece of literature that has ever been written Its because this book shows how joyful and fun reading can be ",?
"Reading doesnt have to be intimidated and hard to be good ",?
"The best booksthe books that stick with you and make you smile when you think about themare the ones that challenge you teach you something useful and entertain the heck out of you ",?
"This book did all that and more ",?
"This is the first book I have every read that I can honestly recommend everyone read ",?
"Im not even sure how to do the parental guidance on this one ",?
"I recommend the parent read it first and then decide if their child can handle it ",?
"At the very least the parent will have some funThis review was originally posted on Kookie Krysp Reads Stars but I wish I could give it about out of ",?
"hehe ",?
"Its so wonderful",?
"I gotta be honest I missed the Harry Potter train whenever I was a wee tyke ",?
"I had never seen the movies or read the books until last year whenever my grandmom gave me and my sister the whole movie collection and told us we had to watch them because theyre simply amazing as she said ",?

"I was absolutely amazed at how great the storyline really is how wonderful all of the characters are and ultimately how MAGICAL it really is ",?
"This past summer my family and I went on our annual trip to Anaheim California ",?
"We always go to Disneyland Huntington Beach and Universal Studios ",?
"I was really excited to hear that Universal Studios had a new Diagon Alley area that was supposed to be as magical as the Harry Potter movies ",?
"Lets just say I was in absolute wonder ",?
"We spent almost our entire day in Diagon Alley we only had time to ride two other rides in the whole park before closing time because we stayed there that late ",?
"I was amazed by how magical it all was ",?
"The shops the food the wands the tricks the staff the rides everything was completely and utterly themed for Harry Potter and I honestly felt like I was in Diagon Alley and Hogsmead ",?
"It was INCREDIBLE ",?
"So while we were there I decided that I HAD TO read the books ",?
"I wanted more of this wizarding world I wanted to know more about the characters and everything that surrounds this world ",?
"So we came home I got on ebay found a brand new set of the special edition books that have spines make the castle and I bought them",?
"As soon as they came in I couldnt wait to start reading them ",?
"Becuase of school Im triple majoring in Nursing English and Business and because of the time I have to work preceptorship hours for my BSN in Nursing I havent had near as much time to read ",?
"Its been difficult but I finally got caught up enough in school and finished the books that I was reading over this summer where I could start this book ",?
"Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone",?
"The first book in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter books ",?
"I must say that I was not disappointed at all ",?
"In fact Im even more in love with the world of Harry Potter and these characters that the INCREDIBLE JK Rowling has created ",?
"Its such a lovely book that explores being different outcasted standing up for whats right being afraid and brave at the same time and never losing your curiosity ",?
"Its such an amazing book ",?
"Im so excited that Ive finally got to start reading these lovely books and I cant wait to continue on",?
" Stars but I wish I could give it about out of ",?
"hehe ",?
"Its so wonderful",?
"Thank you JK Rowling for writing these books and creating this world ",?
"I believe youre never too old to discover the magic in this world and become a part of it ",?
"This is just excellent",?
" xo Rachel I cant rate Harry Potter any more than I can rate hot chocolate or weekends or the feeling of being nuzzled by a puppy ",?
"But I can say that the experience of reading this book now when Im older than Lily and James were when they had their son was very different from the experience of reading it for the first time when I was younger than Harry ",?
"Before I had ever seriously said goodbye to anyone I thought that the first chapter was comical ",?

"Before I had ever seriously said goodbye to anyone I thought that the first chapter was comical ",?
"Now its a struggle not to cry alongside Hagrid McGonagall and Dumbledore ",?
"I used to immerse myself in the wizarding world without thinking too much about it ",?
"Now Im fascinated by how JKRs writing choices make that immersion possible ",?
"Magical cultures histories and economies are hinted at in a way that resembles how we usually interact with their reallife counterparts rather than being explained through infodumps that forcefully remind us that were being introduced to a fictional worldI used to look up to Harry thinking of him as a practically grownup hero ",?
"Now Im struck by his social astuteness and his lack of pretension I loved seeing him figure out how to share with Ron without making Ron feel embarrassed as well as his matteroffact acceptance of Quirrells speech impediment ",?
"I was also surprised at how manipulative he is under certain circumstances he would indeed have done well in Slytherin ",?
"Mostly I just wish I could hug him and Hedwig and the others and protect them from the terrible things in the nottoodistant future ",?
"And yet I think their willingness to confront the future is part of what makes them so lovable ",?
"In some ways I still look up to them ",?
"Finally this reading experience created a bridge to the version of myself that opened the book over years ago ",?
"In the time since then weve been inundated with other peoples mostly filmmakers ideas of what Harrys world looks and sounds like ",?
"It took a bit of conscious effort but by displacing those images I rediscovered the world that my own imagination once created part of it modeled after people and places in my own life at the time part of it purely invented and then seemingly forgotten but just waiting to be brought back to lifeUCIt does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to liveUD starsIUm sure this thick book became even more legendary than the author ever dreamed it wouldRowling uses cookie cutter characters to create a fascinating world of magic wizardry and the great divide between good and evil which has always captivated all age groups and which always will ",?

"His friends are the same ",?
"The villain promises to be a fascinating one but heUs not really uncovered yet save for whispers of legends and foreshadowing ",?
"The book was especially enjoyable at the beginning where Harry is unfortunate in his demented average family ",?
"ThereUs humor that works sometimes pushing the story along ",?
"The real excitement starts when Harry steps foot onto Hogwarts ground meeting the bizarre blend of professors other students potions classes and challengesI know the movie was rated poorly by some in comparison to the book ",?
"To me itUs almost word for word including dialogue ",?
"Some of it such as emotion worked better in page form ",?
"I do have to prefer some of the movie though especially when playing Quidditch because the effects made it more interesting ",?
"I think Rowling drug it out too long in book form and because of this dragging on I grew a little bored at timesOverall a cute and quirky simple novel that opens a door to a world that skyrocketed ",?
"IUm hoping I enjoy the later novels more just like I did with the moviesHarry Potter and the Philosophers Stone by JK Rowling starsI wished that I had read this book when I was younger ",?
"It really is amazing ",?

"Is JK Rowling promoting children to immerse themselves in the occult",?
"Should we be scared of this book and ban and burn it",?

"It was a time for firsts a Illtreated neglected year old orphan Harry Potter discovers that he is a wizard an actual honesttogoodness wandswishing wizardb There is a magical school called Hogwarts for young witches and wizards like him and at Hogwarts Harry Potter is a legend and so much more than a small boy who lives in a cupboard under the stairsb He discovers that he had brave parents who loved him dearly and lost their lives to the most powerful dark wizard in existence in a misguided attempt to save their tiny sonc It will be the first time that he will meet his soontobe best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger not knowing that it would be the start of many unforeseen and memorable adventures for the trioFor me the charm lay in reacquainting myself with my favourite cast of characters the great and twinklyeyed Headmaster Albus Dumbledore stern Prof McGonagall with a staunchly hidden softcenter quivering Neville Longbottom who is brave enough to stand up to his friends nasty Draco Malfoy lovable Hagrid the irrepressible Fred and George and of course delightfully detestable Severus Snape ",?
"I also liked the fact that JKRowling carved out a story that was a blend of fantasy and realism ",?
"She refused to patronize her young readers ",?
"She spoke about death in a manner that doesnt usually finds its way into a childrens book ",?
"With minimal sugarcoating she created a world that was rife with pain loss and loveIn this book Harry Potter faces his vile enemy for the very first time with nerve and bravery ",?
"He gets his first opportunity to prove that he is more than just a legendary kid with a mysterious pastThe book sets an adequate pace lays the foundation for future awesomeness and needless to saythe rest is historyIm just going to be honest here It is impossible for me to write an unbiased review of Harry PotterI know Harry Potter has its flaws I know JK Rowling makes mistakes ",?
"But Harry Potter is one of those series where you could give me a list naming all its faults ",?
"and I honestly couldnt care lessI grew up with Harry and it will always be my favourite book series ",?
"No matter if Im happy or sad I will always pick it up again eventually ",?

"No matter if Im happy or sad I will always pick it up again eventually ",?
"So now that youve been warned lets review this book or rather this edition The StoryI dont really need to go into much detail I think everyone knows what the first book is about Harrys first year at Hogwarts and his first encounter with Voldemort and magic ",?
"I love Rowlings writing and the pace of the plot ",?
"There really is not a single dull page in this one ",?
"The EditionI wanted to reread Philosophers Stone for a while now but with all the TBR books in my shelf I never really allowed myself to ",?
"So I was more than happy when I got this beautiful book for christmas ",?
"I dont need to tell you that the illustration in this are amazing because if you took one look at the cover you know that Jim Kay can draw ",?
"Now what might be more interesting Is it worth buyingFor every Potterhead YES DEFINITELYFor everyone that just liked Harry Potter Mhh if you own a copy of the normal edition it might not be necessary to buy this one because the text inside is exactly the same the only bonus are the illustrations ",?
"Even if you dont already own a copy I dont know if it would be wise to buy this because this book really is huge ",?
"Alas hard to transport ",?
"No taking this book to work or school to read during break ",?
"But If you dont plan to bring it with you wherever you go why not",?
"For me this book is definitely worth the money and if I ever were to have kids this is the book Im going to read them ",?
"This is the book that made me love reading ",?
"When I was younger I used to hate reading ",?
"I couldnt do it and I had no interest in learning it but I could memorize ",?
"So in kindergarten reading groups that was exactly what I did ",?
"I memorized ",?
"I memorized the reading group books and passed through them all without ever learning how to read ",?
"It was my first grade teacher that figured me out and spent four weeks teaching me to read ",?

"It wasnt until second or third grade my mom brought this home and handed it to me and told me to give it a shot ",?
"Chapter one I handed it back and said I didnt like it she handed it back and told me to try again ",?
"Rinse and repeat for a few chapters until something amazing happened ",?
"I didnt want to give the book back ",?
"I didnt want to put it down to go eat dinner and I certainly didnt want to put it down and go to bed ",?
"I stayed up until I was falling asleep on the pages and then I took it to school and started my bad habit of reading in class ",?
"Then I read through lunch and recess and silent reading time until I finished this book ",?
"I devoured all the others when I could get my hands on them but between Harry Potter books I didnt know what to do with myself ",?
"So my parents did a little digging around and found me another book I liked and then another and another until I became the family bookworm ",?
"I started borrowing books from my older sister I started reading books to my younger brother I read just about everything and anything I could find and I loved every minute of it ",?
"Its really hard to rate a book that I grew up on but if any book deserves five stars its this one because it helped turn me into the person I am ",?
"The series itself got me through a lot of hard times and I love going back to it and rereading it because it feels like coming home ",?

"When there were no more HP books to read I went into a sort of withdrawal counting down the days until the next installment became available ",?
"I went and watched all the movies on opening weekend ",?
"I was utterly obsessed ",?
"The thing that I am most grateful for is the love of reading that was instilled in me as a result of JK Rowlings books ",?
"Once I got a taste of the excitement of reading I couldnt stop ",?
"And that my friends is why reading is now my favorite thing to do ",?
"That is why I began to write my own stories plays and poems and am currently working on a novel that I hope to publish one day ",?
"I owe all this to JK Rowling ",?
"I cant thank her enough for what her books have done for me ",?
"The story of Harry Potter an elevenyearold boy horribly abused and neglected by his family if you can even call the Dursleys a family was one that saddened me when I first read of it ",?
"It still saddens me to this day ",?
"Still as a little kid whenever I went through some hard times I always told myself that Harry had it worse than me and he endured ",?
"I aspired to be like Harry ",?
"If he could deal with the Dursleys then I could deal with whatever life threw at me ",?
"Harry Potter is the kind of kid I would love to have as a friend ",?
"Hes brave humble and loyal ",?
"I find myself forgetting that hes a fictional character as I read but at the same time wishing with all my heart that I could meet someone like him ",?
"And then we have Ron ",?
"Ron was hilarious what with his dry humor and sarcasm that never came across as bitter or like he was trying too hard ",?
"While I noticed that he was selfconscious about his familys financial situation he wasnt all woe is me about it ",?
"He was a good and loyal friend to HarryAs for Hermione I adored her ",?
"I found myself connecting with her on such a personal level ",?
"I could relate to almost everything she went through ",?
"I also happen to have a mane of bushy brown hair brown eyes buck teeth before I got braces and a love of books and libraries ",?
"I too am a huge goodytwoshoes that many people would consider smart ",?
"But most of all I have a habit of shooting my hand up in the air every time a teacher asks a question ",?
"Snape would probably despise me ",?
"Hermione was practical smart responsible and a great friend ",?
"Her amazing cleverness and skill in magic is even more commendable because of the fact that shes Muggleborn ",?
"Shed had no prior experience with magic of any kind before coming to Hogwarts and still she came out top of her class in her first year ",?
"Take that Draco",?
"Speaking of Draco allow me to rant about the obnoxious git ",?
"He was the most contemptible pompous jealous spoiled little brat Ive ever encountered in a book ",?
"He seemed to have absolutely nothing better to do than follow Harry and his friends around and ruin their lives in any way possible ",?
"Ugh ",?
"Someone needs to hit this kid ",?
"Still theres a part of me that feels bad for Draco too ",?
"I think all of his hatred for Harry and his friends is really jealousy ",?
"Think about it this way ",?
"Harry had great friends Draco has dumb mean cronies ",?
"Harry is famous Draco doesnt get any attention ",?
"Harrys great at quidditch Dracos not really good at anything though he does excel in douchebaggery ",?
"While the bad still outweighs the good we have to remember that hes just a lonely jealous kid that needs to lash out at someoneNow lets talk about one of my favorite characters Severus Snape ",?
"I love him ",?
"Is that so wrong",?
"I adore that man ",?
"My opinion of him has never changed ",?
"Sure I knew he was a jerk in all the books and I got so angry at him at those times ",?
"At the same time though I was thoroughly amused by his sarcastic caustic wit ",?
"You have to admit hes funny mysterious complex and even sexy in his own weird way ",?
"As I continued with the series I grew stronger feelings for him ",?
"Stronger annoyance at his bouts of meanness stronger understanding of why he did what he did and finally in the last book a stronger love and respect of his character ",?
"The first time I read Sorcerers Stone I was so confused",?
"Did he hate Harry or didnt he",?
"Was he trying to kill Harry or save him",?
"This is what I love most about Snape ",?
"The inner machinations of his mind are an enigma if you know where that line is from go buy yourself an ice cream ",?
"Then we have Hagrid the sweetest cutest giant of them all ",?
"I love his adorable accent his love of deadly animals and how much of a great father figure he is for Harry Ron and Hermione ",?
"I think his ludicrous belief that deadly creatures are actually harmless stems from his own personal experience ",?
"At first Hagrid seems threatening and hostile because of his size and wild appearance when really he is a huge sweetheart ",?
"In this way he feels he can relate to the dangerous creatures that he loves ",?
"Except the majority of these creatures dont turn out to be sweethearts like HagridAs for the Dursleys I cannot deal with them ",?
"I despise these people ",?
"Cant stand them for the life of me ",?
"Somehow I almost find myself hating them more than I hate Voldemort especially Petunia ",?
"God damn it woman this kid is your BLOOD relative ",?
"He is your sisters son and you treat him like a prisoner ",?
"You wouldnt even treat strangers that way",?
"As much as I despised this family I found them funny as well particularly Vernons angry explosions ",?
"And last but most certainly not least there is Albus Dumbledore ",?
"I love him for his cute craziness as well as his wisdom ",?
"Ive never seen a better combination of the two ",?
"He is a wonderful father figure for Harry ",?
"Still the mystery surrounding him frustrates me ",?

"There is absolutely no point in me writing another review of the story you can read my original one HERE because Im pretty sure that most of the people who are going to be looking at buying this book are already going to be Harry Potter fans so instead Im going to focus on the quality of the book and the illustrationsTo put it simply this book is STUNNING ",?
"I had high expectations but was totally blown away by how beautiful this book is it brings back the magical feeling of reading Harry Potter for the first time and I think its definitely a perfect edition to read with children ",?
"Jim Kay has done a fantastic job of giving new life to the characters hes managed to make them his own which must have been quite hard to do considering how well everyone knows the actors from the movies while still making them instantly recognisableThe book itself is a lot larger than I expected and has me wondering if theyll have to publish the later books in more than one edition ",?

"And exactly because her writing is so good the one flaw Ive found pains me to the point that I cant read these with the pure pleasure they give so many othersThe only person Ive talked to about this whos been willing to listen long enough to understand what Im saying is the one person I know who hasnt read the books and has no plans to ",?

"Ill grant you that accepting flaws in things we love is a littletaught skill in this world ",?
"Its almost as rare as seeing good qualities in those we hate ",?

"I have yet to meet someone who can acknowledge the admirable qualities of books they cant stand ",?
"I dont mean genuinely bad books the kind that will be pulped a year after they were printed if they last that long or that will never make it to paper in the first place not because technology is awesome but because nobody wants to waste the paper on these works ",?
"No I mean books that have stood the test of time but who have as many haters as loversPerfect example Little Women ",?
"People adore this book or they despise itListen up Little Women is corny mawkish and sentimental ",?
"Its also wise funny and strong ",?
"Whether you like the book or you hate it if you cant admit that all of this is true and this can all be true at the same time about the same book you have a serious ego problem ",?
"You cant admit that the book you love could have anything wrong with it ",?
"Krinkle krinkle ittle tar",?

"Thats not cringeinducing",?
"Calling a grown woman Marmee isnt cringeinducing",?

"Marmees advice to Meg about the difference between the flashing tempers of the March girls and the temperament of the man Meg married stands the test of time very well as do plenty of the other observations of humanity when Jo laughingly admits that shes well enough to go on a carriage ride with Laurie but not well enough to do disagreeable chores and then karma kicks her in the arse ",?
"Which it tends to do a lot in this bookPut your ego aside when thinking about and discussing literature ",?
"Good books are not saints ",?
"They should be admired enjoyed learned from and reread but they should also be critically examined ",?
"And if Ive done all that with the Harry Potter books and Ive found something I think is a serious flaw it would be nice to be able to discuss that rather than be glared and yelled at yes both have happened and yes Im still angry because I have the unmitigated gall to find something wrong with Saint JoFor anyone whos still reading Im very uncomfortable with one aspect of the world Rowling has created ",?
"Specifically I dont think her justification for hiding the existence of magic from the world of ordinary humans stands up well in a court of ethicsThis is a review of the first book so Ill only go into what she says here ",?
"When Harry Potter first learns who is parents really are Hagrid is furious at the Dursleys for not having told him anything about what he calls Harrys world ",?
"Our world I mean ",?
"Your world ",?
"My world ",?
"Yer parents world Its terribly wrong not to have told Harry who and what he is and who and what his parents were ",?
"Agreed ",?
"How then is it all right to hide what is after all the real world from the majority of its inhabitants",?
"How is it all right to scorn them for not having magic while at the same time doing everything to keep them from knowing magic existsDont say theres no scorn ",?
"Muggle is hardly a term of endearment ",?
"Yes Im jumping ahead of myself and I promised I wouldnt but mudblood is nothing but an extension of the condescension contained in Muggle And as for the attitude towards the mundane world look at Hagrid one of the good guys certainly and a very appealing characterAlthough Hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way ",?
"He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slowI dont know how the Muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalatorWe manage because you wont let us do otherwise ",?
"And then you sneer at the job we doLet me ask you something Do you really believe that separate but equal can be both",?
"Thats not how it works in the real world and its not how it works in Potters world ",?
"The magical beings there are an elite minority and they like it that way ",?
"They have the power ",?
"Theyre hanging on to it by force more about that in later books even when that puts the inhabitants of the mundane world at risk WAY more about that in later booksLet me ask you something else If you read and enjoy Austens novels in the way that many people do taking pleasure in imagining yourself a member of that world you imagine yourself as one of the genteel right",?
"Not one of the servants ",?
"We see very little of them and they have miserable lives ",?
"The power situation in Austens time was horribly imbalanced and unfair ",?
"Austen wasnt in much of a position to do anything about it but at least she didnt have her characters brag all the time about how awesome it was to be of the landowning class and how pathetic those stupid servants areIn fact the one character I can think of who does complain about servants is Aunt Norris and shes an outandout villain ",?
"Her observations on the serving class are meant to reinforce just what a nasty piece of work she isOne person I know claimed that in the Potter universe the magicusers keep their existence and powers a secret in order to protect themselves ",?
"Thats contradicted later I think in book in which Harry reads a textbook about how much real witches enjoy being burned at the stake because it tickles and doesnt do them any harm but for now Ill just point out what Hagrid says when Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic keeps it from the Muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the countryBlimey Harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems ",?
"Nah were best left aloneIf Rowling wanted to make a universe in which a failed attempt had been made in the past to live on equal terms with the nonmagic world and that attempt had led to great suffering and many lives lost on both sides that would be perfectly tenable ",?
"And fascinating ",?
"Somebody write that book ",?
"Okay I will If she wanted to claim that magicusers would be persecuted by the ordinary humans and the magicians might have the magic but the mundane world had the sheer numbers and a lot of nasty technology on their side that would certainly work ",?
"And then I could read these books without a qualmInstead shes created a world in which a ruling class cheerfully admits that they like having all the really cool stuff and theyre jolly well not going to share with those foolish mortals who are so stupid they have to struggle up broken escalatorsWhat troubles me even more than her making this decision which as Ive pointed out is not the only way to go if you want to have a world of hidden magic is how enthusiastically her readers have embraced it ",?
"There are No Muggles Allowed posters and Facebook pages ",?
"Created and enjoyed by people who dont seem to realize that just as theyd more likely be a servant than gentility in Austens world odds are good theyd be Muggles in Rowlings ",?
"People who have felt odd and left out all their lives naturally embrace the idea that secretly theyre special and strong magical even ",?
"I only question the idea that having wonderful abilities has to go hand in hand with lording it over those who dont ",?
"How is the Potter universes attitude toward nonmagic users any different from Malfoys gloating over his entirely inherited monetary wealth and sneering at Rons povertyIm very uncomfortable with the Potter universe because I dont have the ego to believe Id be one of the special ones ",?
"Im rereading these with my son because he doesnt remember them very well and his grandmother kindly lent us an entire hardcover library of the British editions ",?
"This journey has its pleasures but its the last Ill take to the Potter world ",?
"Its no place for MugglesUPDATE Im now about a hundred pages into the British edition of the last Harry Potter book and Im already seriously considering rereading the whole series just to have the entire incredibly complex plot fresh in my head for once ",?

"Thats a fairly lame idea already but other than deriding some of the snobby elitists among the wizardly class it is itself ridiculously elitist presenting its only nonwizardly people as an overblown idiotic parody of middle class smallmindedness conformity and materialism and making the elevation into the wizard class an unequivocally good thing ",?
"Second it makes the magical into the mundane ",?
"Otherworldly and magical things things beyond the everyday are trivialized by transposing them into a world of magic shops and wizard schools essentially no different from nonmagic shops and nonwizard schools ",?
"It doesnt help that all the magical things are stock s with absolutely no originality or imaginationOutside its center of lameness the book fails in all its basic storytelling s ",?
"Its written in a completely standardized kidsbook style full of simplistic exaggerations stock phrases and twee comments from the narrator ",?
"Even if that style didnt irritate me with its obviousness and simplification its utterly indistinct here the words have no verve ",?
"It does nothing of note to create suspense excitement pathos vivid imagery or anything else ",?
"And the dialogue is flat and unnatural lacking any distinct voicesSimilarly all its characters are clichesUthe knowitall girl the goofy goodhearted guy the classist snob etcUthat are given no definition or nuance beyond their stereotypes ",?
"Actually theyre so vague that they lack even the definiteness of their stereotypes ",?
"The villains are given still less Snape is mean and punishes kids unfairly Voldemort is evil and kills people and thats it ",?
"And the characters personality and feelings are related in the most simplistic ways ",?
"Harry Potter himself is just a cliched cipher of wishfulfillment the mistreated kid with no friends whos really the most special of all kids and destined for greatnessThe overarching narrative is still another cliche a journey away from home in which kids learn and grow and a move into an upperclass world full of possibilities and glamor and excitement ",?
"Within that everything is just more lame cliches of school life and childhood friendships ",?
"Theres also the kids being tested doing some of that learning and growing by foiling an evil plot ",?
"But the evil plot is painfully contrived especially the ridiculous bit where all the characters conveniently get to show what theyre good atUblech so undeveloped that it barely registers and carrying no weight ",?
"It also revolves around the ultimate cliche of misdirection the person you least expect did it",?

"I still love every single moment as much as I had the first time around ",?
"I still found The Dursleys reaction to magic hilariously comical Hermiones and Rons banters are adorable and riproaringly funny at times oh they were so meant to be and I enjoyed JKRowlings ability to weave up an entire new bizarre world with its own set systems and good lord her food description is absolutely fantastic ",?
"My mouth waters even at the thought of Chocolate Frogs Pumpkin Juice Butterbeer and every single meals the house elves at Hogwarts have to offer ",?
"Id even try a taste at Bertie Botts Every Flavour beansIn a nutshell this entire series is utterly magical Need I say more and I wont ever forget this anytime soon ",?

"I always thought of the HP series as being set in a world designed for children but now I understand how wrong my thinking was ",?

"RowlingUs style addresses children teens and adults alike and thatUs what I admire most about her writingIUm only days older than the first book of the Harry Potter series as of its publication date yet it has needed days before I finally entered the world of Hogwarts along with Harry Potter Ron Weasley Hermione Granger Neville Longbottom and all the other wellknown characters connected with the series and two more days before I finished the first year in Hogwarts ",?

"One aspect of the story that there has been a lot of discussion about is why Harry was left with the Dursleys after the death of his parents ",?

"Although he cannot understand why they do not like him because of his magical ability they teach Harry a very valuable lessonkindness when he comes across all different kinds of people at Hogwarts he is more prone to showing kindness to them after the way he has been treated by the Dursleys ",?

"Yes the books get darker and more mature and much better later on but this one is for middle school aged kidsThis is my first time rereading book in at least years ",?
"This book commits sins I would never forgive if they occurred in a different book ",?
"The main characters are dumb the authority figures should all be fired for child endangerment and in order for some events to make any sense one has to create their own headcanon ",?
"Typically at such points I stop remind myself that this is a childrens book and get a glass of Makers But forgive them I do ",?
"Rowling creates a fantastic world characters and story over these seven books that makes it all worth it ",?
"If I were reading this for the first time today I honestly do not know if I would DNF this due to the above sins or simply for it targeting a much different audience than adult me ",?
"But I do know that having read the rest of the series it didnt even cross my mind not to finish this reread despite seeing all of the problems ",?
"The writing is designed so the target audience ages with Harry so while we never get adult novels we do get much better writing in later books ",?
"If you read this book or even the first two and the writing is much of what turned you off I encourage you to keep going for another couple of booksAs a final note my rating for this book is for the series ",?

"Not that I didnt like him but he just didnt have as distinct of a personality as Hermione and Ron ",?
"However I still admired his loyalty and selflessness ",?
"Im really excited to see how his character develops throughout the seriesHermioneIs it bad if I see a lot of myself in Hermione",?
"Haha ",?
"I can be the occasional smartalec who gets all up in your businessso naturally I love Hermione Granger ",?

"Rowling did a marvelous job of luring me into Potters world ",?
"The only aspect of the universe that puzzles me is where exactly is Hogwarts",?
"Is it in a different universe from our reality",?
"If so how are Harry and Ron I started a wee bit on Chamber of Secretsas soon as I finished this one able to fly a car there",?
"What I Loved UC The protagonist and side characters ",?
"Lovely lovely lovely characters ",?
"Rowling did a spectacular job of creating such a hilarious and realistic castUC The plot was highly entertaining ",?
"Though a little short Harry and his friends adventure was incredibly entertaining and I am especially curious about what other secrets Hogwarts holdsUC Rowlings writing was pleasant and engaging ",?
"A little simple yes but short and sweet ",?
"What else should I expect from a Middle Grade novelUC The plot twist in the end ",?

"It was interesting how I ended reading finally the books of Harry Potter ",?
"Id heard some comment here and there even before of the first film from some acquaintances and I had the general knowledge that it was becoming a phenomenon but still I didnt feel compelled to read the books ",?
"Ive been reader all my life but I dont know I was kinda undecided about it ",?

"how wrong I was ",?
"I had some good surprises because I wasnt reading the books like in the third movie ",?
"When I watched the fourth film Goblet of Fire I was commenting it with a friend that he was reading the books on Spanish and he told me enough stuff that was in the fourth book BUT it was missed on the fourth film that I decided then to read the books ",?
"Oddly enough while my friend was been reading the books on Spanish he had an edition on English of the first book this one and since by then I already was reading on English he lent me the book ",?
"Usually I am quite reluctant to borrow books or that people lent me books ",?
"I had some bad experiences borrowing books and while I am dependable and careful about stuff that its not mine still I dont want to have books etc ",?
"that are not mine under my care ",?
"Still my friend insisted and he told me that he was glad that somebody read the book since he bought it in an impulse thinking that he would read it but he aborted the mission and he prefer to read on Spanish ",?
"Since I wasnt SO convinced to read the books I ended accepting the offer of that he lent me the book ",?
"I started to reading it ",?
"OH MY GOODNESS",?
"Right in the first pages when Hagrid mentioned WHO lent him out the flying motorcycle",?
"OH MY GOODNESS",?
"Keep on mind that I already watched films by then so reading the identity of the real owner of the motorcycle mentioned in so casual way and right in the beginning of the saga",?
"OH MY GOODNESS",?
"Then I knew that JK Rowling was a wicked genius",?
"And this first book kept me surprising me even when I was already reading the fifth book since certain character that appears in the first book then I said Oh boy what a boring chapter why did JK bothered to create such unimportant character and I was starting to read the fifth book and ",?
"Mmh ",?
"where I heard about this character beforewheremmmhOH MY GOODNESS",?
"NO",?
"IT CANT BE ",?
"By then I had returned the borrowed book but I had bought my own copy for the collection and I consulted it and POW",?
"Yes it was the same character",?
"Right in the first book",?
"So reconfirmed like for the umpteenth time ",?
"JK Rowling is a wicked genius",?
"I enjoyed a lot reading the first book ",?
"JK Rowling has a very interesting style of writing ",?

"Going to buy the school supplies ",?
"Having to deal different kind of teachers ",?
"Some good some strict some both ",?
"The forming of friendships with schoolmates ",?

"I absolutely adore this new edition of Harry Potter and I hope that they will make illustrated versions of all of the books although they might get quite big Getting to experience this story once again after not having read the book for a long time and this time with beautiful illustrations to complement the story was a truly magnificent experience ",?
"JK Rowling is the queenHarry Potter is and will always be one of my all time favorite series ",?

"I just knew I loved it and had to read them as quickly as possible ",?
"By the time I discovered these beautiful books the first four were already out and OoTP was released not long after ",?
"needless to say I caught on quickly as to how big the fandom was ",?

"Its quite a small world really in this first book and theres not an awful lot of worldbuilding but such a short book I think thats fair enough ",?
"The plot felt a little badlystitched together in some places as if theyd be written separately and then threaded together later ",?
"There were a few eyeroll moments and some really ridiculous moments but there were also some lovely moments great characters Id forgotten about and overall a nice flow to how it all panned outThe thing Im most looking forward to is the development of Hermione ",?
"I dont really like Harry all that much and Ron is just one of those oh youre here characters to me and my favourite Luna wont be turning up for another four books or so although I didnt remember that Hermione had been purposefully described as Bossy and Im so excited to see how she changes in the books ",?

"It set the standard for contemporary fantasy ",?
"Rowling make full use of classic literary and mythological references freeing herself from the confines of the merely topical while giving it all a daring sense of newness ",?
"This series will live forever ",?
"The number of times Ive read this book has gotten out of hand and yet I can never get tired of reading Harry PotterAlthough I believe I should mark this as my first time reading the books in English all the previous times has been the translated version ",?

"Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review tapi sebelum itu rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir iniSaya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah sekitar akhir ",?
"Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilihmilih buku bekas ketika shopkeepernya menawari saya buku ini ",?
"Dia berpromosi kalo ini buku bagus banget dan sayang banget kWownggak kerasa sudah tahun sejak saya kenalan sama Harry Potter dan terpesona pada dunia buatan Madame Rowling ini ",?
"Saya tahu kalo saya mestinya bikin review tapi sebelum itu rasanya pengen nostalgia saat pertama kenalan sama bocah dengan luka berbentuk petir iniSaya pertama ketemu Harry Potter di Bras Basah sekitar akhir ",?
"Saat itu saya sedang asyik memilihmilih buku bekas ketika shopkeepernya menawari saya buku ini ",?
"Dia berpromosi kalo ini buku bagus banget dan sayang banget kalo ampe gak saya beli ",?
"Dia juga bilang kalo Harry Potter ini lagi happening banget di Inggris sanaWaktu itu saya kenal internet cuma sebatas email dan chatting doang gak pernah browsing ",?
"Saya pun bukan tipe yang langganan majalah ato koran jadi saya benarbenar gak tahu kalo ada buku berjudul Harry Potter yang lagi booming ",?
"Saya malah curiga kalo buku ini adalah buku jelek yang gak laku ",?
"Ya logikanya aja kalo emang tuh buku buagus banget kok udah ada yang jual secondnya di Bras Basah",?
"Dan kalo emang laris buanget kenapa juga si shopkeeper maksamaksa saya buat beli",?
"Tebakan saya sih ini buku gak laku dan si shopkeeper mo nepu saya Ohhow stupid I wasAkhirnya buku Harry Potter itu saya beli juga karena sang shopkeeper menjamin saya boleh tukar dengan buku lain kalo nggak puas ",?
"Dan begitulah awalnya saya kenal sama Harry PotterRasanya saya gak perlu menulis sinopsis buku ini ato bahkan memberi tahu buku ini termasuk dalam genre apa ",?
"I mean seriously",?
"Sudah tahun lebih sejak demam Harry Potter melanda dunia its been all over the news ",?
"Kalo bahkan ampe detik ini Anda nggak tahu garis besar cerita Harry Potter berarti Anda emang gak berminat sama buku ini ",?
"Then why bothers now",?
"Jadi lebih baik saya membahas apa yang saya rasakan sewaktu membaca kembali buku ini setelah tahun berlaluYang pertama saya rasa sih auranya yang beda ",?
"Sewaktu pertama baca Harry Potter dulu temanteman saya gak ada yang ngeh sama buku ini yah sebenernya ampe sekarang temen saya yang baca buku ini juga sedikit sih ",?
"Jadi saya heboh sendiri bahas buku ini sendirian dan dapat tatapan loengomongapasih dari temanteman bahkan fangirling pun sendirian kasian ",?
"Sekarang ini berkat GR dan BBI saya jadi kenal banyak orang yang juga ngefans sama Harry Potter bahkan ampe baca bareng ",?
"Jelas vibenya beda banget ",?
"Dan itu menyenangkan ",?
"Horeeeeesaya masuk golongan mainstream heheYang kedua saya mengubah pandangan saya tentang Harry di buku pertama ",?
"Awal baca dulu saya beranggapan Harry ini kepo banget ",?
"Kenapa sih pusing banget sama kemungkinan Sorcerer Stone dicuri sama Voldemort",?
"Kenapa gak kirim Hedwig aja ke Dumbledore sih buat warning itu adalah pertanyaan saya duluSekarang saya ngerti kenapaSeperti yang dibilang Harry Dumbledore tahu bahwa Harry butuh untuk mencoba melawan karena pertarungan dengan Voldemort itu personal untuk Harry ",?
"Gimana pun Voldemort lah yang membunuh orangtua Harry ",?
"Dan Harry sadar kalo Voldemort bisa kembali menyerang diaTapi terutama karena Harry sadar bahwa kembalinya Voldemort dapat membuat dia kehilangan dunia sihirHe was nothing in the muggle world ",?
"Gak punya siapa pun dan apa pun ",?
"Lalu dia menemukan semuanya di dunia sihir sahabat kebahagiaan dan terutama penerimaan ",?
"Penerimaan yang tak pernah dia dapatkan sebelumnya ",?
"Gak heran kalo Harry berkeras mempertahankannya ",?
"Id do the same if I were him ",?
"Id fight the nastiest wizard if I have to in order not to let something most precious being taken from me ",?
"So I could understand Harrys determination to fight Voldemort even when hes still a kidKetiga ternyata saya sudah suka Ron dari buku ke XJangan salah dari trio itu Ron memang favorit saya kok ",?
"Saya suka Ron karena kalimatnya yang witty dan rada sarkastis belum lagi sindirannya yang tajam ",?
"Tapi kualitas itu baru keliatan di buku kedua ato malah ketiga ",?
"Yang pasti bukan di buku pertamaDulu saya gak ngerti apa yang bikin saya bersimpati sama Ron sejak awal ",?
"Sekarang saya tahu ",?
"Karena Ron orang pertama yang menerima Harry ",?
"Dia gak meremehkan Harry seperti yang dilakukan Malfoy tapi dia juga gak memujanya secara berlebihan ",?
"Dia menganggap Harry sama normalnya dengan dia and thats enoughKeempat saya makin kagum dengan persahabatan Ron dan Hermione ",?
"Theyre true bestfriendsTanpa ragu Ron dan Hermione menemani Harry untuk melawan Voldemort walopun mereka tahu resikonya ",?
"I mean saya ngerti kesetiaan Ron dan Hermione pada Harry di buku ke ",?
"Theyve come a long way ",?
"Tapi di buku ",?
"Saat mereka baru kenal tahun kurang serta belum ngeh seberapa parah kondisinya kalo Voldemort kembali berkuasa",?
"Thats greatKelima perubahan karakter Neville kerasa banget ya ",?
"Neville yang penakut dan gak berani membela dirinya sungguh berbeda dengan Neville di buku ke ",?
"I forgot how awkward clumsy and shy Neville was ",?
"But lets talk about him on the later bookKeenam wowpenerjemah Harry Potter ini keren sekali yaSaya sudah pernah sih baca versi Inggris dan terjemahan buku ini untuk reread yang ini saya baca versi Inggrisnya lagi dan dari dulu memang saya tahu penerjemahnya emang canggih ",?
"Tapi baru sekarang saya benarbenar ngehMirror of Erised diterjemahkan Cermin Tarsah ",?
"Erised yang merupakan anagram dari desire diterjemahkan jadi tarsah yang anagram dari hasrat ",?
"Wow",?
"Dan setelah saya googling saya dapat info kalo sebenarnya ide Tarsah ini baru kepikir belakangan menjelang bukunya turun cetak ",?
"Karena sang penerjemah berkeras mesti ada padanan yang tepat untuk erised ",?
"Dan iya beliau emang bener karena erised dan tarsah adalah padanan yang cocokKetujuh hmmsaya tetap gak ngerti kenapa Professor Quirrell gak bisa menyentuh Harry hanya di bagian akhir buku ini",?
"Waktu awal cerita Harry bertemu Prof Quirrell di Diagon Alley dan saat itu mereka sudah berjabat tangan ",?
"Kok saat itu tangan si Quirrell gak melepuh ya",?
"Padahal sudah jelas kalo Voldemort telah nebeng di tubuh Quirrell saat ituKedelapan saya makin kagum deh sama JK RowlingOkesaya tahu kalo JKR emang banyak menggunakan bantuan mitos legenda ato apalah itu dalam ceritanya ",?
"So its not really original ",?
"Tapi toh emang gak ada formula yang benarbenar baru ",?
"Yang penting sih gimana Rowling bisa meramu bahan yang ada ",?
"And shes really good at itTapi yang sebenarnya keren dari Rowling adalah dia benarbenar paham karakter pembacanyaI guess in some points of our life even if its just for one time we ever felt like Harry whos a misfit and wishing to go to some place new where we could start everything from the scratch or becoming a different people ",?
"But not everyone could do that ",?
"Apparently Harry is one of those lucky peopleReading Harrys journey gave me happiness ",?
"Happiness that comes from knowing that at least theres one person in this world who could fulfill his dreams ",?
"It also gave me some hopes that in the end everything will be fine for me too ",?
"If this boy whose life was much more miserable than me finally found what he always wanted how could I not",?
"Dan Rowling juga dengan cerdasnya memilih setting di Inggris suatu tempat yang masih bisa terjangkau dan karenanya masih terasa dekat ",?
"Bukannya tempat jauh antah berantah seperti di Middle Earth sana atau dunia magic namun tak terjangkau seperti Abarat ",?
"Terlibatnya kaum manusia non sihir aka muggle juga tempattempat di Inggris seperti stasiun Kings Cross membuat cerita ini makin terasa dekat di hati membuat kita okesebenernya sih saya berani berharap bahwa suatu saat nanti saya juga bisa dapatehemsurat saya sendiri ",?

"It was fun and offered me a whole different experience to reading the book in general but Im not so sure I would be so quick to pick it up again for pure reading purposes ",?
"It is very large and heavy ",?
"It is awkward to hold and can be difficult to read if you do your reading in bed guilty ",?
"Like I mentioned it enhances the reading experience but not completely essential to enjoying the book ",?
"Now I dont have kids and the last picture book I read was Berenstein Bears ",?

"Its something thats almost impossible to realize here in the first one and that I still appreciate each and every time I pick up this seriesWhen I first picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone I had no idea the impact it would have on my life ",?
"It was just a story about a boy that finds out hes a wizard and has to fight the forces of evil ",?

"The characters though varied and threedimensional are fairly standardAnd yet this all combines into this wonderful fantastical world that pulls me in and makes me wonder whats hiding behind that brick wall over there or what I might be missing out of the corner of my eyeI remember distinctly the feeling of sorrow that I had upon finishing this first book and realizing I was already too old to get a letter to Hogwarts ",?
"The world is so enchanting that I cant help but want to be a part of it ",?
"Its all about the feeling that it evokes in me ",?
"It makes me feel like theres magic in the world and its not necessarily the turnamouseintoasnuffbox type of magic or the type where the chess pieces actually fight each other though how awesome would that be ",?
"Its the type where friendship is stronger than anything that gets thrown at it ",?
"Where people kids can fight against injustice and wrong and win ",?
"It lets you know that life isnt always fair and that you might have to battle against things that are scary and horrible but the happiness at the end is always worth itAnd I suppose thats what keeps me coming back time and time again to reread revisit and relive this story ",?

"While reading this I felt simultaneously transported back in time and into another worldThe world was filled with magic and mythical creatures and the time was when I was eleven years old and filled with imagination and wonder ",?
"Ive read my fair share of childrens books but Ive never read one that so perfectly captured the feeling of how wonderful and freeing it is to be a child ",?
"I loved the moments when Harry Ron and Hermoine got to play eat sweets and find mischief like normal kids just as much as I liked the moments when they were learning magic and fighting monsters ",?
"Even the most mundane activities were written in such a wistful and intriguing way that I was afraid to miss a single word ",?
"Usually if I my eyes glaze over I just keep reading until I get caught up but that was impossible to do with this book ",?
"I was scared that if I looked away for even a moment I might miss something ",?
"When the story began I hated the Dursleys with such a passion ",?
"A group of more miserable and hateful people has never been found ",?
"After a while I had to remind myself to chill out because things were going to get better for Harry eventually ",?
"And thats the only way I made it though those first chapters without throwing my book across the room ",?
"But something happened when Harry met Rons mom for the first time ",?
"I was so relieved when she was sweet and motherly towards him that I realized why the Dursleys had to be so terrible ",?
"There are plenty of mean and horrible people Harry has to deal with but those bad people make the friends Harry meets seem all the more wonderful ",?
"After I realized how necessary the villains were to the story I started to enjoy them more ",?
"When Harry and the gang got in trouble instead of just feeling dread and worrying about them I also looked forward to seeing how they were going to get out of their current scrape ",?
"There was a chemistry between all the characters in this book that was such a pleasure ",?
"Harry is an innocent and heroic little boy who is lucky to have a loyal and brave friend like Ron and Hermione is the smart mother hen ",?
"She worries about them both tells them when their ideas are stupid and then goes along to keep them out of trouble ",?
"And Dumbledore is insanely funny it only took two scenes for me to fall in love with him and wish he was my crazy greatuncle ",?
"I honestly cant think of a thing I didnt love about this book ",?
"I even loved the names",?
"Sir Nicholas de MimsyPorpington is the best name in the history of names and I will never refer to him as UCHeadless NickUD Everything was so well thought out and planned and there were more than a few surprising moments that I never saw coming ",?
"I am so glad that I waited as long as I did to read this ",?
"I have always liked to read but when I was a kid I didnt love it the way I do now ",?
"I finally know why everyone loves this book so much ",?
"Its not because it is the greatest piece of literature that has ever been written Its because this book shows how joyful and fun reading can be ",?
"Reading doesnt have to be intimidated and hard to be good ",?
"The best booksthe books that stick with you and make you smile when you think about themare the ones that challenge you teach you something useful and entertain the heck out of you ",?
"This book did all that and more ",?
"This is the first book I have every read that I can honestly recommend everyone read ",?
"Im not even sure how to do the parental guidance on this one ",?

"We always go to Disneyland Huntington Beach and Universal Studios ",?
"I was really excited to hear that Universal Studios had a new Diagon Alley area that was supposed to be as magical as the Harry Potter movies ",?
"Lets just say I was in absolute wonder ",?
"We spent almost our entire day in Diagon Alley we only had time to ride two other rides in the whole park before closing time because we stayed there that late ",?
"I was amazed by how magical it all was ",?
"The shops the food the wands the tricks the staff the rides everything was completely and utterly themed for Harry Potter and I honestly felt like I was in Diagon Alley and Hogsmead ",?
"It was INCREDIBLE ",?
"So while we were there I decided that I HAD TO read the books ",?
"I wanted more of this wizarding world I wanted to know more about the characters and everything that surrounds this world ",?
"So we came home I got on ebay found a brand new set of the special edition books that have spines make the castle and I bought them",?
"As soon as they came in I couldnt wait to start reading them ",?
"Becuase of school Im triple majoring in Nursing English and Business and because of the time I have to work preceptorship hours for my BSN in Nursing I havent had near as much time to read ",?

"Now its a struggle not to cry alongside Hagrid McGonagall and Dumbledore ",?
"I used to immerse myself in the wizarding world without thinking too much about it ",?
"Now Im fascinated by how JKRs writing choices make that immersion possible ",?
"Magical cultures histories and economies are hinted at in a way that resembles how we usually interact with their reallife counterparts rather than being explained through infodumps that forcefully remind us that were being introduced to a fictional worldI used to look up to Harry thinking of him as a practically grownup hero ",?
"Now Im struck by his social astuteness and his lack of pretension I loved seeing him figure out how to share with Ron without making Ron feel embarrassed as well as his matteroffact acceptance of Quirrells speech impediment ",?
"I was also surprised at how manipulative he is under certain circumstances he would indeed have done well in Slytherin ",?
"Mostly I just wish I could hug him and Hedwig and the others and protect them from the terrible things in the nottoodistant future ",?
"And yet I think their willingness to confront the future is part of what makes them so lovable ",?
"In some ways I still look up to them ",?
"Finally this reading experience created a bridge to the version of myself that opened the book over years ago ",?
"In the time since then weve been inundated with other peoples mostly filmmakers ideas of what Harrys world looks and sounds like ",?
"It took a bit of conscious effort but by displacing those images I rediscovered the world that my own imagination once created part of it modeled after people and places in my own life at the time part of it purely invented and then seemingly forgotten but just waiting to be brought back to life ",?

"I loved her from the beginning and every aspect of her character was so well written not to mention hilariously brought across ",?
"Ron and HarryUs understandable disgust of her is epic ",?
"The only character I said UCMehUD at was Voldemort ",?
"He had so much hype around him from chapter one that I didnUt think he could possibly be that scary ",?
"He wasnUt ",?
"Any villain who doesnUt kill his victims straight away is going to end up defeated U probably by a preteen and his little gang of snivelly nosed adventureseekers ",?
"Being over ten years old the style of childrenUs books as changed since Harry Potter first hit the shelves ",?
"Does that affect this novel",?
"No",?
"It stands in a classy light of itUs own ",?
"It canUt be accused of being UCclichUE UD because it started everything",?
"ItUs well written and well plotted and I think my only complaint is Harry having to spend his summer holidays back with the Dursely family ",?
"As to the controversial aspect",?
"Witchcraft",?
"Wizardry",?
"Is JK Rowling promoting children to immerse themselves in the occult",?
"Should we be scared of this book and ban and burn it",?
"Well apart from my personal conviction that a book should never be burned I canUt see much difference to reading about dragons and fairies to frolicking through HarryUs adventures in Hogwarts ",?
"JK Rowling presents a side for evil and a side for good ",?
"It can be argued how is magic ever good",?
"And it can also be argued is there such a thing as magic",?
"Or fairies for that matter",?
"And I still believe in them Harry Potter is a fairy tale ",?
"Take it or leave it at that ",?
"If I had a small child which I donUt beingUwell a teen and all I would probably not let them read Harry Potter until they were ten or so ",?
"Then we could discuss it ",?
"It is an epic classic still standing after decades and still inspiring children to imagine have adventures and write ",?
"Or find their letter to Hogwarts ",?
"That option might outweigh the others ",?
"I highly doubted that I would ever write a review for any of the Harry Potter books ",?
"Instead I created a shelf called seven greatest books ever and threw them all in there hoping that would be enough to display my immense love for them ",?
"After seeing Part of the Deathly Hallows movie I decided that I would kick start the rereading process before the release of Part so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone for probably the th time and began to read ",?

"After seeing Part of the Deathly Hallows movie I decided that I would kick start the rereading process before the release of Part so I picked up Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone for probably the th time and began to read ",?
"I realized part way through that even if I didnt want to review it for its literary merit I still had much to say about the book solely regarding how it makes me feelAt twenty three years of age the book is still everything that it was for me when I was only twelve ",?
"I remember seeing it in a book order remember those in the sixth grade and putting a star next to it to take home to my mom ",?
"My mom not wanting to buy me a book Id never read denied me my request adding that it looked pretty silly anyway the joke was on her though she came to love them too ",?
"Anyway the next year my cool uncle dont we all have one decided he was going to buy them for my cousin and she was going to have to let me borrow them ",?
"So I began the Harry Potter books and suddenly being twelve awkward and unpopular wasnt quite so lonely as it had always been ",?
"I dreamed myself right into Harry Potters world not in a dangerous psychotic way but in a starry eyed childlike way ",?
"Harry Ron and Hermione were better friends to me than anyone I met throughout my junior high and high school years which in a way is a bit sad but I have no regretsThis was the first time that Ive read Sorcerers Stone since Deathly Hallows came out and it inevitably made for a far more emotional experience than the first time around ",?
"What was once just good innocent fun cant exactly be viewed as such when youve seen the big picture ",?
"I literally burst into tears at the end of the chapter in which Harry and Ron finally take Hermione as their friend ",?
"Oh what the heck",?
"Ill go ahead and post the paragraph in case anyone else is wanting to ride the high of that emotional waveBut from that moment on Hermione Granger became their friend ",?
"There are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other and knocking out a twelvefoot mountain troll is one of them ",?
"Knowing what they were in store for years of utter devotion to one another made this moment so much bigger now than it had seemed at first ",?
"Either way though its a very moving moment ",?
"I love this book ",?
"I will always love this book ",?
"And I full intend to disown any future children of mine who cant appreciate it with me I havent decided as to whether or not thats a joke yet ",?
"I was expecting my return trip to Hogwarts to be something of a dampener ",?
"I had finished the series and after all how many more surprises could the first book reveal",?
"The magic must have faded over time and the characters must surely have achieved the status of houseguests who had overstayed their welcome ",?
"Predictably enough I was wrong ",?

"I also liked the fact that JKRowling carved out a story that was a blend of fantasy and realism ",?
"She refused to patronize her young readers ",?
"She spoke about death in a manner that doesnt usually finds its way into a childrens book ",?
"With minimal sugarcoating she created a world that was rife with pain loss and loveIn this book Harry Potter faces his vile enemy for the very first time with nerve and bravery ",?
"He gets his first opportunity to prove that he is more than just a legendary kid with a mysterious pastThe book sets an adequate pace lays the foundation for future awesomeness and needless to saythe rest is history ",?
"Im just going to be honest here It is impossible for me to write an unbiased review of Harry PotterI know Harry Potter has its flaws I know JK Rowling makes mistakes ",?
"But Harry Potter is one of those series where you could give me a list naming all its faults ",?
"and I honestly couldnt care lessI grew up with Harry and it will always be my favourite book series ",?
"No matter if Im happy or sad I will always pick it up again eventually ",?

"So now that youve been warned lets review this book or rather this edition The StoryI dont really need to go into much detail I think everyone knows what the first book is about Harrys first year at Hogwarts and his first encounter with Voldemort and magic ",?
"I love Rowlings writing and the pace of the plot ",?
"There really is not a single dull page in this one ",?
"The EditionI wanted to reread Philosophers Stone for a while now but with all the TBR books in my shelf I never really allowed myself to ",?
"So I was more than happy when I got this beautiful book for christmas ",?
"I dont need to tell you that the illustration in this are amazing because if you took one look at the cover you know that Jim Kay can draw ",?
"Now what might be more interesting Is it worth buyingFor every Potterhead YES DEFINITELYFor everyone that just liked Harry Potter Mhh if you own a copy of the normal edition it might not be necessary to buy this one because the text inside is exactly the same the only bonus are the illustrations ",?
"Even if you dont already own a copy I dont know if it would be wise to buy this because this book really is huge ",?
"Alas hard to transport ",?
"No taking this book to work or school to read during break ",?
"But If you dont plan to bring it with you wherever you go why not",?
"For me this book is definitely worth the money and if I ever were to have kids this is the book Im going to read them ",?
"This is the book that made me love reading ",?
"When I was younger I used to hate reading ",?
"I couldnt do it and I had no interest in learning it but I could memorize ",?
"So in kindergarten reading groups that was exactly what I did ",?
"I memorized ",?
"I memorized the reading group books and passed through them all without ever learning how to read ",?
"It was my first grade teacher that figured me out and spent four weeks teaching me to read ",?
"I owe a lot to that woman ",?

"Chapter one I handed it back and said I didnt like it she handed it back and told me to try again ",?
"Rinse and repeat for a few chapters until something amazing happened ",?
"I didnt want to give the book back ",?
"I didnt want to put it down to go eat dinner and I certainly didnt want to put it down and go to bed ",?
"I stayed up until I was falling asleep on the pages and then I took it to school and started my bad habit of reading in class ",?
"Then I read through lunch and recess and silent reading time until I finished this book ",?
"I devoured all the others when I could get my hands on them but between Harry Potter books I didnt know what to do with myself ",?
"So my parents did a little digging around and found me another book I liked and then another and another until I became the family bookworm ",?
"I started borrowing books from my older sister I started reading books to my younger brother I read just about everything and anything I could find and I loved every minute of it ",?
"Its really hard to rate a book that I grew up on but if any book deserves five stars its this one because it helped turn me into the person I am ",?
"The series itself got me through a lot of hard times and I love going back to it and rereading it because it feels like coming home ",?

"Without even applying ",?
"HeUs a Gryffindor the most fantabulous house in the school ",?
"HeUs fantastic at broomsticking even though heUs never had any practice whatsoever ",?
"Immediately instead of getting punished for breaking the rules he gets put on the Quidditch team even though itUs unheard of for someone so young to be there ",?

"I had it out from the library for nine weeks because I kept putting it down for ten days or so then realizing I should probably finish it to see if it got better ",?
"IUd pick it up and realise that IUd forgotten what had happened before meaning I had to go back to the beginning and start all over again ",?
"This as you may well imagine drove me nutsEventually with the help of SparkNotes I managed to figure it out and IUve just taken book out of the library ",?

"When there were no more HP books to read I went into a sort of withdrawal counting down the days until the next installment became available ",?
"I went and watched all the movies on opening weekend ",?
"I was utterly obsessed ",?
"The thing that I am most grateful for is the love of reading that was instilled in me as a result of JK Rowlings books ",?
"Once I got a taste of the excitement of reading I couldnt stop ",?
"And that my friends is why reading is now my favorite thing to do ",?
"That is why I began to write my own stories plays and poems and am currently working on a novel that I hope to publish one day ",?
"I owe all this to JK Rowling ",?
"I cant thank her enough for what her books have done for me ",?
"The story of Harry Potter an elevenyearold boy horribly abused and neglected by his family if you can even call the Dursleys a family was one that saddened me when I first read of it ",?
"It still saddens me to this day ",?
"Still as a little kid whenever I went through some hard times I always told myself that Harry had it worse than me and he endured ",?
"I aspired to be like Harry ",?
"If he could deal with the Dursleys then I could deal with whatever life threw at me ",?
"Harry Potter is the kind of kid I would love to have as a friend ",?
"Hes brave humble and loyal ",?
"I find myself forgetting that hes a fictional character as I read but at the same time wishing with all my heart that I could meet someone like him ",?
"And then we have Ron ",?
"Ron was hilarious what with his dry humor and sarcasm that never came across as bitter or like he was trying too hard ",?
"While I noticed that he was selfconscious about his familys financial situation he wasnt all woe is me about it ",?
"He was a good and loyal friend to HarryAs for Hermione I adored her ",?
"I found myself connecting with her on such a personal level ",?
"I could relate to almost everything she went through ",?
"I also happen to have a mane of bushy brown hair brown eyes buck teeth before I got braces and a love of books and libraries ",?
"I too am a huge goodytwoshoes that many people would consider smart ",?
"But most of all I have a habit of shooting my hand up in the air every time a teacher asks a question ",?
"Snape would probably despise me ",?
"Hermione was practical smart responsible and a great friend ",?
"Her amazing cleverness and skill in magic is even more commendable because of the fact that shes Muggleborn ",?
"Shed had no prior experience with magic of any kind before coming to Hogwarts and still she came out top of her class in her first year ",?
"Take that Draco",?
"Speaking of Draco allow me to rant about the obnoxious git ",?
"He was the most contemptible pompous jealous spoiled little brat Ive ever encountered in a book ",?
"He seemed to have absolutely nothing better to do than follow Harry and his friends around and ruin their lives in any way possible ",?
"Ugh ",?
"Someone needs to hit this kid ",?
"Still theres a part of me that feels bad for Draco too ",?
"I think all of his hatred for Harry and his friends is really jealousy ",?
"Think about it this way ",?
"Harry had great friends Draco has dumb mean cronies ",?
"Harry is famous Draco doesnt get any attention ",?
"Harrys great at quidditch Dracos not really good at anything though he does excel in douchebaggery ",?
"While the bad still outweighs the good we have to remember that hes just a lonely jealous kid that needs to lash out at someoneNow lets talk about one of my favorite characters Severus Snape ",?
"I love him ",?
"Is that so wrong",?
"I adore that man ",?
"My opinion of him has never changed ",?
"Sure I knew he was a jerk in all the books and I got so angry at him at those times ",?
"At the same time though I was thoroughly amused by his sarcastic caustic wit ",?
"You have to admit hes funny mysterious complex and even sexy in his own weird way ",?
"As I continued with the series I grew stronger feelings for him ",?
"Stronger annoyance at his bouts of meanness stronger understanding of why he did what he did and finally in the last book a stronger love and respect of his character ",?
"The first time I read Sorcerers Stone I was so confused",?
"Did he hate Harry or didnt he",?
"Was he trying to kill Harry or save him",?
"This is what I love most about Snape ",?
"The inner machinations of his mind are an enigma if you know where that line is from go buy yourself an ice cream ",?
"Then we have Hagrid the sweetest cutest giant of them all ",?
"I love his adorable accent his love of deadly animals and how much of a great father figure he is for Harry Ron and Hermione ",?
"I think his ludicrous belief that deadly creatures are actually harmless stems from his own personal experience ",?
"At first Hagrid seems threatening and hostile because of his size and wild appearance when really he is a huge sweetheart ",?
"In this way he feels he can relate to the dangerous creatures that he loves ",?
"Except the majority of these creatures dont turn out to be sweethearts like HagridAs for the Dursleys I cannot deal with them ",?
"I despise these people ",?
"Cant stand them for the life of me ",?
"Somehow I almost find myself hating them more than I hate Voldemort especially Petunia ",?
"God damn it woman this kid is your BLOOD relative ",?
"He is your sisters son and you treat him like a prisoner ",?
"You wouldnt even treat strangers that way",?
"As much as I despised this family I found them funny as well particularly Vernons angry explosions ",?
"And last but most certainly not least there is Albus Dumbledore ",?
"I love him for his cute craziness as well as his wisdom ",?
"Ive never seen a better combination of the two ",?
"He is a wonderful father figure for Harry ",?
"Still the mystery surrounding him frustrates me ",?
"What did he see in the Mirror of Erised dammit",?

"I have only seen the Harry Potter movies up to now but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this first book in the series ",?

"Review to come and expect to see another six HP reviews from me in the coming months",?

"Tornare ad Hogwarts UE sempre un toccasana ",?
"Im the only person in the world with mixed feelings about the Harry Potter books ",?
"Most readers love them ",?
"There are nonreaders who are indifferent to them as they are to all other books others who go solely by the fact that theyre childrens books and therefore believe its ridiculous for adults to read and enjoy them and of course a legion of similarly antiliteracy folk who have decided the Harry Potter books are immoral ",?
"These people who read and enjoy Tolkien CS ",?

"These people who read and enjoy Tolkien CS ",?
"Lewis and stories about Merlin and King Arthur have concluded that the Potter universe is an evil place because it has magic and witches ",?
"All righty then ",?
"I suppose there are readers who genuinely dislike the Harry Potter books ",?
"I havent come across them but they must be out there somewhere ",?
"And of course there must be readers who say they dislike them when what they mean is theyre wildly jealous that they didnt write themI dont belong in any of those categories ",?
"I admire the fine writing characterization dialogue and worldbuilding Rowling has done ",?
"And exactly because her writing is so good the one flaw Ive found pains me to the point that I cant read these with the pure pleasure they give so many othersThe only person Ive talked to about this whos been willing to listen long enough to understand what Im saying is the one person I know who hasnt read the books and has no plans to ",?
"He thinks I make a valid point ",?
"Everyone else Ive attempted to engage on this topic has responded Youre saying something bad about Harry Potter ",?
"You must be bad ",?
"I hate you ",?
"Please leave my home Or words to that effect ",?
"Ill grant you that accepting flaws in things we love is a littletaught skill in this world ",?
"Its almost as rare as seeing good qualities in those we hate ",?
"This is as true with books as it is with people and its tragic ",?
"I have yet to meet someone who can acknowledge the admirable qualities of books they cant stand ",?
"I dont mean genuinely bad books the kind that will be pulped a year after they were printed if they last that long or that will never make it to paper in the first place not because technology is awesome but because nobody wants to waste the paper on these works ",?
"No I mean books that have stood the test of time but who have as many haters as loversPerfect example Little Women ",?
"People adore this book or they despise itListen up Little Women is corny mawkish and sentimental ",?
"Its also wise funny and strong ",?
"Whether you like the book or you hate it if you cant admit that all of this is true and this can all be true at the same time about the same book you have a serious ego problem ",?
"You cant admit that the book you love could have anything wrong with it ",?
"Krinkle krinkle ittle tar",?
"Really",?
"Thats not cringeinducing",?
"Calling a grown woman Marmee isnt cringeinducing",?
"Having the one black child at Jos school for boys be the best singer isnt seriously cringeinducing ",?
"Or else you refuse to entertain the idea that anything you hate could have anything right about it ",?
"Marmees advice to Meg about the difference between the flashing tempers of the March girls and the temperament of the man Meg married stands the test of time very well as do plenty of the other observations of humanity when Jo laughingly admits that shes well enough to go on a carriage ride with Laurie but not well enough to do disagreeable chores and then karma kicks her in the arse ",?
"Which it tends to do a lot in this bookPut your ego aside when thinking about and discussing literature ",?
"Good books are not saints ",?
"They should be admired enjoyed learned from and reread but they should also be critically examined ",?
"And if Ive done all that with the Harry Potter books and Ive found something I think is a serious flaw it would be nice to be able to discuss that rather than be glared and yelled at yes both have happened and yes Im still angry because I have the unmitigated gall to find something wrong with Saint JoFor anyone whos still reading Im very uncomfortable with one aspect of the world Rowling has created ",?
"Specifically I dont think her justification for hiding the existence of magic from the world of ordinary humans stands up well in a court of ethicsThis is a review of the first book so Ill only go into what she says here ",?
"When Harry Potter first learns who is parents really are Hagrid is furious at the Dursleys for not having told him anything about what he calls Harrys world ",?
"Our world I mean ",?
"Your world ",?
"My world ",?
"Yer parents world Its terribly wrong not to have told Harry who and what he is and who and what his parents were ",?
"Agreed ",?
"How then is it all right to hide what is after all the real world from the majority of its inhabitants",?
"How is it all right to scorn them for not having magic while at the same time doing everything to keep them from knowing magic existsDont say theres no scorn ",?
"Muggle is hardly a term of endearment ",?
"Yes Im jumping ahead of myself and I promised I wouldnt but mudblood is nothing but an extension of the condescension contained in Muggle And as for the attitude towards the mundane world look at Hagrid one of the good guys certainly and a very appealing characterAlthough Hagrid seemed to know where he was going he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way ",?
"He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slowI dont know how the Muggles manage without magic he said as they climbed a brokendown escalatorWe manage because you wont let us do otherwise ",?
"And then you sneer at the job we doLet me ask you something Do you really believe that separate but equal can be both",?
"Thats not how it works in the real world and its not how it works in Potters world ",?
"The magical beings there are an elite minority and they like it that way ",?
"They have the power ",?
"Theyre hanging on to it by force more about that in later books even when that puts the inhabitants of the mundane world at risk WAY more about that in later booksLet me ask you something else If you read and enjoy Austens novels in the way that many people do taking pleasure in imagining yourself a member of that world you imagine yourself as one of the genteel right",?
"Not one of the servants ",?
"We see very little of them and they have miserable lives ",?
"The power situation in Austens time was horribly imbalanced and unfair ",?
"Austen wasnt in much of a position to do anything about it but at least she didnt have her characters brag all the time about how awesome it was to be of the landowning class and how pathetic those stupid servants areIn fact the one character I can think of who does complain about servants is Aunt Norris and shes an outandout villain ",?
"Her observations on the serving class are meant to reinforce just what a nasty piece of work she isOne person I know claimed that in the Potter universe the magicusers keep their existence and powers a secret in order to protect themselves ",?
"Thats contradicted later I think in book in which Harry reads a textbook about how much real witches enjoy being burned at the stake because it tickles and doesnt do them any harm but for now Ill just point out what Hagrid says when Harry asks why the Ministry of Magic keeps it from the Muggles that theres still witches an wizards up an down the countryBlimey Harry everyoned be wantin magic solutions to their problems ",?
"Nah were best left aloneIf Rowling wanted to make a universe in which a failed attempt had been made in the past to live on equal terms with the nonmagic world and that attempt had led to great suffering and many lives lost on both sides that would be perfectly tenable ",?
"And fascinating ",?
"Somebody write that book ",?
"Okay I will If she wanted to claim that magicusers would be persecuted by the ordinary humans and the magicians might have the magic but the mundane world had the sheer numbers and a lot of nasty technology on their side that would certainly work ",?
"And then I could read these books without a qualmInstead shes created a world in which a ruling class cheerfully admits that they like having all the really cool stuff and theyre jolly well not going to share with those foolish mortals who are so stupid they have to struggle up broken escalatorsWhat troubles me even more than her making this decision which as Ive pointed out is not the only way to go if you want to have a world of hidden magic is how enthusiastically her readers have embraced it ",?
"There are No Muggles Allowed posters and Facebook pages ",?
"Created and enjoyed by people who dont seem to realize that just as theyd more likely be a servant than gentility in Austens world odds are good theyd be Muggles in Rowlings ",?
"People who have felt odd and left out all their lives naturally embrace the idea that secretly theyre special and strong magical even ",?
"I only question the idea that having wonderful abilities has to go hand in hand with lording it over those who dont ",?
"How is the Potter universes attitude toward nonmagic users any different from Malfoys gloating over his entirely inherited monetary wealth and sneering at Rons povertyIm very uncomfortable with the Potter universe because I dont have the ego to believe Id be one of the special ones ",?
"Im rereading these with my son because he doesnt remember them very well and his grandmother kindly lent us an entire hardcover library of the British editions ",?
"This journey has its pleasures but its the last Ill take to the Potter world ",?
"Its no place for MugglesUPDATE Im now about a hundred pages into the British edition of the last Harry Potter book and Im already seriously considering rereading the whole series just to have the entire incredibly complex plot fresh in my head for once ",?
"Yes the things that bug me philosophically about this series still bother me but the writing is just too good for even cranky old me to resist ",?
"The audio book was a whole new experience U UFEF ",?
"Brillante",?
"UBFPor quUE no habUEDa leUEDdo Harry Potter antes",?

"She laughed cried celebrated with and cheered for HP and his friends ",?
"She can even remember the names of each of the characters in the whole series",?
"Reading Harry Potter has opened up a world of books for her and now shes reading Gail carrigers Waistcoats Weaponry book three in the Finishing School series and she has already finished reading The Naughtiest Girl in the School series a few YA middle grade paranormal books The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset and my YA horror book Warm Bodies and she loved it",?
"I think my little bookworm is about to raid my stash of books and I better move my romancegrown up books out of the way until shes a bit olderOnce again I finished reading Harry Potter and Philosophers Stone but this time I read it with my nine year old son ",?
"Hes a reluctant reader who loves the outdoors and computer games so I decided to use HP to improve his reading skills and perhaps help him discover love of booksHe loves watching the HP movies only the first three but this is the first time he has read Harry Potter and Philosophers Stone and he tells me the book is better than the movie",?
"Im so proud of him",?
"Hes upset the movies left out Peeves the Poltergeist the prankster ghost and his new favourite character ",?
"Hes already quoting The Philosophers Stone and hes adding a few twists of his own and its pretty funny and adorable",?
"Weve already started Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Its going to take us a long time to finish the HP series but itll all be worth it in the end ",?
"Already a new generation is discovering the phenomenal magical and beautiful series that is Harry Potter and Im so happy to play a small part in this discovery ",?
"JK Rowlings humour incredible imaginative and easily accessible writing skills makes reading HP is as easy asUCSwish and flickUD ",?
"Awful in every way ",?
"The whole book is centered on lame even deplorable ideas ",?
"First it divides people into the wizardly and the nonwizardly in a class system ",?
"Thats a fairly lame idea already but other than deriding some of the snobby elitists among the wizardly class it is itself ridiculously elitist presenting its only nonwizardly people as an overblown idiotic parody of middle class smallmindedness conformity and materialism and making the elevation into the wizard class anAwful in every way ",?

"Thats a fairly lame idea already but other than deriding some of the snobby elitists among the wizardly class it is itself ridiculously elitist presenting its only nonwizardly people as an overblown idiotic parody of middle class smallmindedness conformity and materialism and making the elevation into the wizard class an unequivocally good thing ",?
"Second it makes the magical into the mundane ",?
"Otherworldly and magical things things beyond the everyday are trivialized by transposing them into a world of magic shops and wizard schools essentially no different from nonmagic shops and nonwizard schools ",?
"It doesnt help that all the magical things are stock s with absolutely no originality or imaginationOutside its center of lameness the book fails in all its basic storytelling s ",?
"Its written in a completely standardized kidsbook style full of simplistic exaggerations stock phrases and twee comments from the narrator ",?
"Even if that style didnt irritate me with its obviousness and simplification its utterly indistinct here the words have no verve ",?
"It does nothing of note to create suspense excitement pathos vivid imagery or anything else ",?
"And the dialogue is flat and unnatural lacking any distinct voicesSimilarly all its characters are clichesUthe knowitall girl the goofy goodhearted guy the classist snob etcUthat are given no definition or nuance beyond their stereotypes ",?
"Actually theyre so vague that they lack even the definiteness of their stereotypes ",?
"The villains are given still less Snape is mean and punishes kids unfairly Voldemort is evil and kills people and thats it ",?
"And the characters personality and feelings are related in the most simplistic ways ",?
"Harry Potter himself is just a cliched cipher of wishfulfillment the mistreated kid with no friends whos really the most special of all kids and destined for greatnessThe overarching narrative is still another cliche a journey away from home in which kids learn and grow and a move into an upperclass world full of possibilities and glamor and excitement ",?
"Within that everything is just more lame cliches of school life and childhood friendships ",?
"Theres also the kids being tested doing some of that learning and growing by foiling an evil plot ",?
"But the evil plot is painfully contrived especially the ridiculous bit where all the characters conveniently get to show what theyre good atUblech so undeveloped that it barely registers and carrying no weight ",?
"It also revolves around the ultimate cliche of misdirection the person you least expect did it",?
"And hes a noncharacter defined only by being nervous and stuttering enough to be the person youd least expectFinally Quidditch is the stupidest sport ever ",?
