I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.<br>I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It's a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can't help but love.<br>It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that's just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I'm forgetting. <br>And then there's the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there's Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent.

Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)<br><br>One day, there were shiny new books on her school library's \"New Releases\" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children's novels.<br><br>At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid's fantasy novel. She had read the <i>Outlander</i> series earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn't really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.<br><br>And that did not include Harry Potter. <b>Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14.</b> There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was a <i>teenager</i>, dammit.<br><br>But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader. And Khanh was tempted.<br><br>She picked up the first book in the series: <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>.<br><br>The end.<br><br><b>Or rather, the beginning.</b></span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"1337135146090763124\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n          </span>\n        </div>\n\n\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\n          \n\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review346176116\">\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link346176116\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=346176116&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">flag</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_346176116\"><a id=\"like_count_review_346176116\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/346176116?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">611 likes</span></a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">Like</a></span>\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a href=\"/review/show/346176116?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_346176116\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/346176116/comments?reverse=true\">View all 56 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_153694564\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Nia Geraint\" href=\"/user/show/46678024-nia-geraint\"><img src=\"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_25x33-ccd24e68f4773d33a41ce08c3a34892e.png\" alt=\"U 25x33\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/46678024-nia-geraint\">Nia Geraint</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer18139818891700237418\">I'm disppointed, as I can't remember when I first read the Philosopher's Stone.

Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It <i>\"ain't the same fuckin' ballpark, it ain't the same league, it ain't even the same fuckin' sport.\" </i><br><br>There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.<br>I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me.

One of them admitted not being able to finish it. <s>She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety. (But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)</s><br><br>When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside. I read only those books that my brother told me to read. He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype. However, when Warner Bros. released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date. I was wrong. She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed. We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it: <i>\n  <b>I will never read Harry Potter</b>\n</i>.<br><br>My daughter is now 15 going 16. She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter. However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books. Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read. So the following day, I bought my copy.<br><br>After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it? Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars? Most of them did not bother writing a review. Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet. But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long.<br><br>These are what some of them say:<blockquote> <i><b>it was a great book <br>i enjoyed reading it</b></i>\n</blockquote> For an eloquent reviewer, she must have been too happy to express herself. <blockquote> <i><b>Such a great story and creative way of writing. I love Harry Potter.</b> </i>\n</blockquote> Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative. <blockquote> <i><b>I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too! It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter. Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book. I enjoyed reading it</b></i>\n</blockquote> Coming from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads. I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though. <blockquote> <i><b>Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards.</b></i>\n</blockquote> Another one of my favorite reviewers. That seems to have nailed this. Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery. That should be it! The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!<br><br>Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work. The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school. Blasphemy.<br><br>Just kidding. This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it. I was just kidding. To be frank, I tried hard not to like this. I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book. <i>I told you so! Why waste your time? </i>. However, unless you are a grumpy old man/woman, there is nothing not to like about this book. I maybe too old for it but hey, talent is talent and J. K. Rowling <i>has</i> it!<br><br>My 39 friends are indeed right!</span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"13235546725378458344\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n          </span>\n        </div>\n\n\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\n          \n\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review86964275\">\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link86964275\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=86964275&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">flag</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_86964275\"><a id=\"like_count_review_86964275\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/86964275?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">319 likes</span></a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">Like</a></span>\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a href=\"/review/show/86964275?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_86964275\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/86964275/comments?reverse=true\">View all 112 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_159004115\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Camryn Doyle\" href=\"/user/show/51517260-camryn-doyle\"><img src=\"https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/user/u_25x33-ccd24e68f4773d33a41ce08c3a34892e.png\" alt=\"U 25x33\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/51517260-camryn-doyle\">Camryn Doyle</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer12362065781291850744\">I figure skate and one year when I was younger I skated to Harry Potter and I skated to it with my friends</span>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <span class=\"xhrCommentFooter greyText\">\n      Nov 11, 2016 06:56AM\n    </span>\n\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_159027462\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Kelly ...\" href=\"/user/show/1330063-kelly\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1217387294p1/1330063.jpg\" alt=\"1330063\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/1330063-kelly\">Kelly ...</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer16505201922969360840\">Wonderful review -- it might be my favorite review of any book that I have ever read.

As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I\u2019d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.<br><br>Harry deserves it. <br><br>However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I\u2019ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people. <br><br>Here goes...<br><br>Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that. <br><br>It\u2019s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.<br><br>Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn\u2019t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success. <br><br>Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!<br><br>The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry\u2019s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity\u2019s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.<br><br>How is that not worthy of praise?<br><br>As for Harry himself, he\u2019s just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He\u2019s someone you can\u2019t help but like. <br><br>He\u2019s not perfect. He makes mistakes, he\u2019s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas. <br><br>But that\u2019s not Harry. He\u2019s a better person than that. That\u2019s why we love him. <br><br>Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let\u2019s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy. <br><br>I\u2019ll certainly settle for that. <br><br>As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I\u2019m not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don\u2019t think it reaches stratospheric heights until <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6.Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire__Harry_Potter___4_\" title=\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Harry Potter, #4) by J.K. Rowling\">Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</a>. <br><br>Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.<br><br>3.0 stars. Highly Recommended. <br></span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"5796324344587688677\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n          </span>\n        </div>\n\n\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\n          \n\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review46540413\">\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link46540413\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=46540413&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">flag</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_46540413\"><a id=\"like_count_review_46540413\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/46540413?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">288 likes</span></a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">Like</a></span>\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a href=\"/review/show/46540413?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_46540413\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/46540413/comments?reverse=true\">View all 44 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_143745813\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Quirks\" href=\"/user/show/25544685-quirks\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1460030636p1/25544685.jpg\" alt=\"25544685\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/25544685-quirks\">Quirks</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer7094103183955656256\">If you were looking for Dickens in this, then you should probably note that this is a middle grade novel.</span>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <span class=\"xhrCommentFooter greyText\">\n      Dec 02, 2015 09:41AM\n    </span>\n\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_154029983\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Lex AK\" href=\"/user/show/54045332-lex-ak\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1458342283p1/54045332.jpg\" alt=\"54045332\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/54045332-lex-ak\">Lex AK</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer7827660715474901622\">I think the books sort of build as they go on.

They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.<br><br><b>Except me.</b> <br><br>I didn't grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn't get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it's like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It's just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn't be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn't bother and wouldn't care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel, <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,</i> I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.<br><br><blockquote>\n  <i>There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.</i>\n</blockquote><br><br>I find it stupid of me to write a review for Harry Potter, especially being the first one. I also find it stupid of me how I just recently decided to check this out and finally read it. But still, I guess I can still write a review. Of course, my thoughts would be quite similar to everyone else. Thoughts and opinions, nothing negative, maybe, maybe not. But, here goes nothing.<br><br><i>Harry Potter</i> is one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there. It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it. No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person's heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world. As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.<br>Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children's book but in my opinion, it's in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some. Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names. <br><br>Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn't even know he was a wizard. Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful \"family\", The Dursleys. Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter's mother's sister. The problem is, they didn't like each other, nor blend in with each other. They were different. Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren't able to turn things into other things, aren't able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren't able to do anything, really. Well, she wasn't, besides treat Harry with such disrespect and treat her ugly and fat son with such caress and would spoil him because he was such a little brat that would get what he wants. Really though. There would be 36 presents under a Christmas tree and as he counts them, he pouts and is upset because it's less than what he had the year before. <br><br>DUDE I BARELY GET A BARNES AND NOBLE GIFT CARD CHILL!<br><br>The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess, is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn't able to. His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn't bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person. Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies. Except they don't.<br><br>As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn't know. He doesn't know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent. After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it. He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn't want Harry to know. But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.<br><br>He's huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well. He's got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents. One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well. And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too. <b>He doesn't know what he is talking about and doesn't know what is going on.</b> He doesn't believe he is a wizard, and doesn't believe the reason for his parent's deaths. But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.<br><br>His aunt, finally admitting herself into being a witness of knowing the truth, got everything out of her chest and was able to tell him the truth. She wouldn't even mention her sister, because she pretended to not have one. She was considered perfect and brave, while she was nothing and unnoticed. Nothing has changed, but she didn't even bother trying to care care of her niece as her sister is dead, protecting Harry from wherever she is. And as Hagrid tells Harry the rest, he actually takes Harry with him even when Mr. Dursley \"forbids him.\" He can't do anything, since he is a Muggle and Harry has already been accepted to Hogwarts School and nothing can change. <br><br>When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school. As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else. Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand. He's famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened. But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out. As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it's time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends. Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him. He's not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend. Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be. Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like \"we get it.\" <br><br>Days pass, and Harry is being trained. He's a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone. Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out. With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this \"You-Know-Who\" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever.<br><br><blockquote>\n  <i>Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.</i>\n</blockquote><br><br>Harry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars. Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, \"Why the fuck did I not read this earlier?\" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it's because I was never a fan of it. I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it. I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it. But soon I'll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen. Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young. <u>PATHETIC.</u><br><br>The fantasy is cute, I will say. It's easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through. It's not long, it's not hard, and it's not boring. It's gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page. Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses. Well, I guess in most.<br><br>Everything was fun to read. I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life. He was confused, but he found out a lot more. There's still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how. I'll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness'. I'll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes. I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think. I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger. I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy. But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I'm on an adventure. Reading it for the first time feels like one. I've never watched the films. I've watched parts, but skipped them. Now, I won't skip anything. It's like an adventure where I'm dived in and can't seem to leave because I'm so alive and intrigued.<br><br>What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said? Nothing. Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too. Everyone loves it, and so did I. So will I, I should say. , Yes, I had trouble pronouncing some names at first but got used to it after. Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed. But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene. Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired. Or both. But I was also laughing. I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid. Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious. I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig. I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that's okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times. Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him. He's so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry. I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry. He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end. <br><br>Ron is honestly the cutest. I don't understand how anyone could be mean to him. He may be weak, but he has his own strengths. He's so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him. There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I'll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he's still gonna be really mean throughout the series. I'm sure. I haven't spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else's life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way. Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy. She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor. She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.<br><br>Malfoy Draco was someone I did not like, at all. Like I said, he mocked and made fun of Ron and I hated him for it. He showed off as well but in the bad way, thinking he was really cool just because he's in Slytherin and how used to the wizarding world he is. He didn't show much care about Harry and his past, and would try to get in a fight with Harry while Harry tried fixing the problem. He payed no attention and took it too far with Harry. He was a newbie as well, so I don't see what the point was. But the other point is that I don't have expectations for Draco but I hope I don't end up hating him in all books and hope there is some change, at least slightly good.<br><br>The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites. I know it didn't work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle. Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them. She didn't yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again. As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn't really figure out what to say. But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning. It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes. <br><br>The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand. There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems. I didn't know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences. I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail. Like always, it's no surprise. <br><br><blockquote>\n  <i>There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.</i>\n</blockquote><br><br>Overall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest. Really excited to see where this all goes to, and how Harry becomes a better wizard.</span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"5490175770822059457\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n          </span>\n        </div>\n\n\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\n          \n\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review1743783698\">\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link1743783698\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=1743783698&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">flag</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_1743783698\"><a id=\"like_count_review_1743783698\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/1743783698?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">206 likes</span></a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">Like</a></span>\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a href=\"/review/show/1743783698?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_1743783698\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/1743783698/comments?reverse=true\">View all 41 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_156333663\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Maggie\" href=\"/user/show/51318038-maggie\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1478216651p1/51318038.jpg\" alt=\"51318038\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/51318038-maggie\">Maggie</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer4971645815250002532\"><i>Anisa wrote: \"Wow such a long review!

Yes.</b><br><br>Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won't end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.<br><br>The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children's list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.<br><br>Imaginative Vision<br><br>I read new children's literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,\" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, \"The Wizard of Oz,\" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. \"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book's (and its sequels') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.<br><br>The ultimate model for Harry Potter is \"Tom Brown's School Days\" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken \"Tom Brown's School Days\" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.<br><br>In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of \"Harry Potter.\" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame's \"The Wind in the Willows\" or the \"Alice\" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?<br><br>Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the \"perfectly normal\" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling's version of Tolkein's Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling's cosmos, at least in the first volume.)<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>The first half of a little piece I wrote from the <i>Journal</i> in July 2000.

The Dursleys of 4 Privot Drive are happy in their normalcy, their mediocrity. They think <i>things</i> properly account for the worth of a person, they indulge their already horrible son, and they <i>more than</i> neglect Harry . . . They're dismissive of him. They humiliate him. They <i>stifle</i> him. And they do all of these things thoughtlessly. As if he's not a real person . . . B/c he's <i>other.</i>.<br><br>Their abuse is so offhand, you have to be an adult, or least a mature reader to recognize it for what it is. Younger readers just see a hateful villain. A hateful villain who does such ostentatiously self-centered things to poor Harry that they can alternately \"Yayyyyyy,\" and \"Booooooo,\" with enthusiasm. <br><br>I've heard similar comparisons made about Robin Williams' Genie in Disney's <b>\n  <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103639\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aladdin</a>\n</b>--the character was complex enough for adults to enjoy while being thoroughly entertaining to children.<br><br>So that's my sale. Harry Potter isn't just for children, it's for EVERYONE. In my humble opinion, what Rowling has done with these books makes Disney's Genie look like amateur hour (and I quite like Aladdin. FYI).<br><br>And as the recent popularity of coloring books for adults has proven, people of all ages like pretty things, and that is why this new illustrated version is spectacular:<br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451755894i/17599142.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1451758303i/17599459.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br><img src=\"https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/hostedimages/1452182023i/17657582.jpg\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"description\" class=\"gr-hostedUserImg\"><br><br>SO. We have an engaging premise: a child mysteriously defeats the most powerful dark wizard in memory, becoming instantly famous in one world, a world full of wonder and magic, is raised ignorant of his past by negligent relatives, only to be reintroduced to the magical world when he comes of age to attend the equivalent of middle school.<br><br>We have the earlier referenced fantastical world-building. We have well-developed, often hilarious or reprehensible characters (depending on whether they're meant to be Good or Bad). And we have addictive individual story plots that build into the best Good vs. Evil story arc since LOTR. <br><br>And children LOVE it. <br><br>So will you.

Despite being parentless and being bullied both in the Muggle world and Hogwarts by some kids, he still stood up and even became a great friend to <b>Ron</b>, <b>Hermione</b>, <b>Neville</b>, and the others. <br><br>This story had lots of exciting adventures and I really enjoyed everything that happened in this book. It was just so awesome! The secondary characters are also perfect. I especially love Hermione and her genius mind! Ron's loyalty towards Harry is also awe-inspiring, as well as Neville's adorable clumsiness. When it comes to its plotline, it's amazingly done. The twist was unpredictable and there was humor in every page that made me laugh. What's even great are the lessons and the message that are instilled to every reader, fantasy and magic aside.<br><br><blockquote>\n  <i>\n    <b>\"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.\"</b>\n  </i>\n</blockquote><br><br>I loved all the chapters and my favorites are:<br><br><i>The Boy Who Lived, The Vanishing Glass, Diagon Alley, The Journey from Platform Nine and Three-Quarters, The Sorting Hat</i>, and <i>Quidditch</i>.<br><br>No wonder why this book and the whole series continues to be a real sensation. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1077326.J_K__Rowling\" title=\"J.K.

I don't think anything I write here hasn't been said already. But I've just read the illustrated edition by Jim Kay and if it is possible, it makes this book even more outstanding than it already is. Jim Kay is awesome. Maybe you have read <i> A Monster Calls </i> and already know him. If not, you should definitley reconsider your life choices.<br>I am certainly going to buy an edition of this, it's so pretty I could die.

I'm happy to chat about the definition of literature with you, or what I think about the Harry Potter phenomenon now or whatever, but try and be civil and don't attack me right out of the gate.<br><br>EDIT NOTE in 2011: I've edited this review to take out some teenage arrogance, but the rest is as-is. A few years later and with a degree in hand, including modules in Children's Lit, I could probably write a better review, but people seem to like this one!<br><br><br>I really don't like Harry Potter. It's one of those little concealed but apparently not widely known facts about me, which shocks everyone when I say I love books and they're all, \"yeah, rite, Harry Potter is so awesum rite?\" and I say \"...no, it really isn't.\" I confess: when I was eleven or twelve or so, I read them. I also read the Sabrina the Teenage Witch novels. I read <i>everything</i> and wasn't very discriminating about it. I did enjoy them. I continued to enjoy them until I got to Order of the Phoenix, and then I decided that all the hype aside, I just wasn't interested anymore. Bear in mind, then, for the rest of this \"essay\", that I have only read up to and including The Goblet of Fire.<br><br>Cue a few years of irritation while everyone insisted I <i>must</i> read the rest of the books, and how <i>dare</i> I prefer Tolkien and Ursula Le Guin (and later, Susan Cooper). I have really no objection to people reading the books and enjoying them, taking part in the fandom that surrounds them, dressing up in witchy costumes to go and pick up the most recently released volume at midnight. Have fun with that! As far as I'm concerned you're welcome to. I'm even quite happy to concede that yes, Harry Potter did get more people reading. Whether it got them reading literature or not is another matter: how many people, I wonder, have discovered a mania for reading after reading Harry Potter and then gone onto the likes of Crime and Punishment and War and Peace, or even Lord of the Rings? Not that many, I'll bet. I think they're probably reading Twilight and the like, more often than not. Not that it matters -- as long as people are reading.<br><br>But in any case, I. Don't. Have. To. Read. Them. Just because I like books, does not mean I like <i>those</i> books. And I detest it every time someone shoves them in my face as 'great literature'. I actually had to study Harry Potter, for my English Lit/Lang A Level (for those unfamiliar with our system: A Levels are exams you take when you're about eighteen, which among other things determine whether you can go to university). One of the questions we had to figure out how to answer was whether we thought Harry Potter was good literature, whether we thought it would stand the test of time, and how it was suited to the time it's currently in.<br><br>It was then that I figured out that, yeah, there are things wrong with Harry Potter beyond just the hype that was irritating me so much and the feeling that Rowling in no way matched up to the giants of fantasy and sci-fi, like Tolkien. I studied it alongside Tom Brown's Schooldays, by Thomas Hughes. Do note that I didn't like that book either. But it's a well written, well shaped, well considered book -- and it doesn't use the same cheap tricks as Harry Potter does. I'm not going to say much about that, since it's not a book I liked: if I'm going to compare/contrast, I'll compare with my favourite book that is also supposed to be for younger readers, Susan Cooper's <i>The Dark Is Rising</i>.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone being an amateur first novel. 'cause that's what it is. I'm sure many people's first novels don't even see the light of day, and yet Harry Potter somehow made it to a publisher's and was accepted. The thing is, people mostly refuse to recognise that and the cheap tricks J. K. Rowling uses. For example, her character's names. 'Draco Malfoy'. Mal, the French for bad, immediately obvious. 'Draco', suggesting dragon? Or perhaps 'draconian', which has negative connotations aplenty (not that I'd necessarily attribute those particular ones to Draco). Not very subtle, is it? 'Dumbledore'. Who <i>doesn't</i> get the image of a well-meaning, if strange, old man? 'Minerva', straight out of Greek myth: a goddess of knowledge. Gee, I wonder why Rowling chose that for a female teacher... 'Remus Lupin', 'Sirius Black', 'Mad-Eye Moody'... Do I even have to say anything?<br><br>And 'Harry Potter'. Nothing striking about that: perfectly ordinary, as names go, right?<br><br>Yeah. And that's the point. Harry Potter himself is not a real character -- certainly not at first. He's a cypher, a convenient space into which a kid can very easily insert himself or even herself. He's brave. Okay, generic hero characteristic. He has doubts. Again, the same. He has a Tragic Past. Don't we all? Or don't we all like to think we do? Look at the Mary Sues/self inserts people write in fandom -- so often they're people with incredibly dark, melodramatic pasts that they rise above. Harry Potter is a convenient place to insert yourself. The other characters are archetypes more than anything -- Hermione, the know it all girl; Ron, the loyal friend; Dumbledore, the mentor; Malfoy, the rival...<br><br>All of that is actually what makes Harry Potter a highly readable, enjoyable book, for young people and even adults. It's targeted very precisely toward the readership of today. Maybe that makes J. K. Rowling a better author than I might paint her as, that she can know her audience so well -- there's that view, I'm sure. But it's all very basic, and I tend to look on it as cheap tricks. The whole chapter, in the first book, about the Mirror of Erised -- how sad does it make you feel for Harry? It's sentimental, it's sad -- and it's meant to do that, very obviously. There's a whole chapter written <i>just</i> to enforce the love between the members of Harry Potter's family.<br><br>Susan Cooper does it in a single paragraph that makes me want to cry every single time I read it, coming after all the build up of guilt and pain in the relationship. \"Bran went to [his father] and put his arm round his waist, and stood close. It was the first gesture of affection between the two that Will had ever seen. And wondering, loving surprise woke in Owen Davies's worn face as he looked down at the boy's white head, and the two stood there, waiting.\"<br><br>That paragraph does for me what Rowling's whole chapter cannot. It's so effective, actually, because Cooper spends a whole book leading up to it, <i>showing</i> us Owen and Bran's relationship. Rowling shows us Harry's parents, but in an unsubtle way that actually throws me out of it because I think, \"Oh, yeah, this is the chapter in which we're supposed to feel very sorry for Harry.\"<br><br>There's also a very easy, blunt misdirection. You're supposed to hate Snape, supposed to believe he's the one to blame for everything, and at the end, you're supposed to be as surprised as Harry when it's Quirrel waiting there for him. At the age of eleven, I think I went right along with that, but when I reread it for A Level, I had to wince at how heavy-handed the misdirection was. I understand that later in the series Snape comes into it more, and I don't know whether the misdirection turns out to be not that misdirected when it comes down to the real truth: but in the first book, you're meant to believe it's Snape all along, and I don't think J. K. Rowling does a very good job of giving us clues that it's not actually Snape, because she's so busy blackening him to lead people astray.<br><br>It's also very black-and-white. Questions aren't raised, by this story -- and that's a thing I think is actually important in literature. Raise questions, discuss issues, end with a question. I don't know what to call stories that don't fit into that, really. I'm going to go with 'novels' as opposed to literature. Harry Potter is a novel. It's a story. I don't think it has any real lasting values. Susan Cooper's books, while also quite basic, discussing the Light and the Dark, do end with a question. If man is left on earth, to do as man will, will man be Light or Dark? The immortals leave earth, and say that the world -- for better or worse -- belongs to humans. Right now, a lot of people think the answer to that question would be 'worse'. But Harry Potter does not raise this question, does not raise any question, and does not answer one either. That's why I don't think it will last except perhaps as a phenomenon to be studied: the 'Potter mania' and what caused it.<br><br>That's why I don't like Rowling's writing. It's not particularly refined, it's unsubtle -- and that's okay, you know, I'm not saying you can't enjoy that, can't find it refreshing. I don't. I'm also not saying that 'novels' are bad -- they're good, they can provide valuable escapism, they can be incredibly rich fodder for the imagination, and I suspect Harry Potter is, for many children. But I don't call it literature, and I myself don't <i>like</i> it.<br><br>Note: the three star rating is because honestly, when I first read it, I did love it.</span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"18224270428029388342\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n          </span>\n        </div>\n\n\n      <div class=\"reviewFooter uitext buttons\">\n          \n\n<tr class=\"no_border feedFooterReview\" id=\"update_comment_stuff_Review34349045\">\n  <td colspan=\"2\">\n    <div class=\"updateActionLinks\">\n        <a class=\"right flag\" rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"flag_link34349045\" title=\"Flag this review as inappropriate.\" href=\"/flagged/new?resource_id=34349045&amp;resource_type=Review&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">flag</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n      <span class=\"likeItContainer\" id=\"like_container_review_34349045\"><a id=\"like_count_review_34349045\" rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"/rating/voters/34349045?resource_type=Review\"><span class=\"likesCount\">114 likes</span></a>\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"jsLike like_it gr-button gr-button--small\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/user/new?remember=true&amp;return_url=%2Fbook%2Fshow%2F3.Harry_Potter_and_the_Sorcerer_s_Stone\">Like</a></span>\n\u00a0\u00b7\u00a0<a href=\"/review/show/34349045?book_show_action=true&amp;from_review_page=1\">see review</a>\n    </div>\n\n\n    <div id=\"comments_for_review_34349045\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<div class=\"brown_comment\">\n<span class=\"loadingLinkSpan\"><a class=\"loadingLink\" data-remote=\"true\" href=\"/review/34349045/comments?reverse=true\">View all 124 comments</a><span class=\"loadingAnimation\"></span><span class=\"loadingError\"></span></span>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_145996963\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Rajan\" href=\"/user/show/11662595-rajan\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1456507872p1/11662595.jpg\" alt=\"11662595\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/11662595-rajan\">Rajan</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer9715069385926804697\">v thoroughly</span>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <span class=\"xhrCommentFooter greyText\">\n      Jan 14, 2016 10:08AM\n    </span>\n\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"comment_147364621\" class=\"brown_comment\">\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_photo\">\n    \t<a alt=\"Tria\" href=\"/user/show/5148226-tria\"><img src=\"https://images.gr-assets.com/users/1470698658p1/5148226.jpg\" alt=\"5148226\"></a>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"xhr_comment_body\">\n    <a style=\"font-weight:bold\" href=\"/user/show/5148226-tria\">Tria</a>\n\n      \n<span id=\"freeTextContainer2893685274395621811\">Hm.

Only just read this in full, now that you're in your mid-20s, &amp; tbqh I can sort of see where you're coming from. Having said that, though, a lot of what you hated about the early books as a teenager are the same things that eventually got me to like them. <br><br>I didn't start the series til the release of <em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>, because at the time I was very against reading anything that had that much hype surrounding it - to be frank I was pretty arrogant when it came to \"popular literature\" in my mid-teens; I'm glad to say I've long since grown out of <em>that</em>. I still think the series was over-hyped in the beginning, but I also feel that she wrote it to mature with the group of readers who very literally grew up alongside Harry, and in that sense it rather did. <br><br>I was 11 when the first book was released (Harry's age in the book, though if going by strict chronology it was set a few years before 1997 so he would not have been exactly my age, but we won't get into that), and my first midnight book release was the event for <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, when I was 14. I've never regretted that. I lived in a very rural village at the time, and though I went into the nearest town for midnight, the next bus home wasn't until 7 o'clock. Fortunately, I was on study leave at the time (private school exam schedules), and I spent the rest of the night sitting at a bus stop, reading the new book. I finished it in 6 and a half hours that first time, nicely convenient timing. <br><br>Anyway, to move on, I went to every midnight book release in the series after that, including the final one, the very night after I'd caught the red-eye from Toronto to Manchester via JFK (and had my witch's costume left in New York with all my luggage, thanks to the airline! I was furious - I'd gone in costume to all the others, &amp; couldn't go to the last that way because of a stupid screw-up on the part of a very poor - now defunct - company). I was 21 when the book series ended. I really did grow up with it, and that sort of has an effect all of its own in that it adds a little more affection for the complete set than I might otherwise have had. <br><br>I don't particularly <em>like</em> Harry as a character - I don't recall whether or not I've ever mentioned that to you? Nor Ron. I loved the series, as a teenager, more for its secondary characters than the leading trio, with the exception of Hermione. Even now I only read femmeslash or Hermione/Snape AU fanfiction in the fandom. <br><br>Anyway, part of what else attracted me to it was the way that Rowling <em>did</em> choose to play with tropes and language the way she did, but the way you seemed to loathe when writing this. You and I might have picked up on a great many of the references, and you clearly thought (at least at the time) that they were obvious, but one has to have been precocious at the age to which the books are aimed even to pick them all up. Many of the origins aren't taught in school now, and weren't for my generation or yours, though we're not hugely far apart that way. Many 11-year-olds and teenagers would not know: they'd wonder, and perhaps look them up, and learn more. But what I'm trying to get at here is this: that you and I knew the extra detail to begin with doesn't really make Rowling obvious in her references to her chosen audience, Nikki.<br><br>All that said, I also have to disagree that the series doesn't raise any questions about anything important. The nature of love and hatred, and what traits, abilities, choices and actions make us the people we are and those whom we later become... all those are very central to the series. They may not be especially subtle, but again, this is directed at a specific audience and a generation that was no longer used to such subtlety as a whole and many people who might well have easily missed such concepts, were they less apparent than they were. So I disagree - and on that one I admit that I can't really see how you come to the conclusion that there are no topics such as these raised in the series.<br><br>As far as Snape is concerned, I think we'll have to agree to disagree - I wondered from Book 1 what his motivations were, and can't remember ever assuming he was so broadly painted that he could only be thoroughly evil. Granted, much of Snape's characterisation pays off in better ways later in the series, and hindsight only improves the lot, so depending on whether you ever did finish it I suppose your view may be affected by that. But - not to push - I do think that if you never have, it might be worth a try just to see whether it affects your view of the earlier material. It certainly did mine.<br><br>It's a decent review, though. I'm not criticising you: YMMV. And you admit to the teenage arrogance that's unfortunately quite present in it, so that gives you brownie points. o/</span>\n  <a data-text-id=\"2893685274395621811\" href=\"#\" onclick=\"swapContent($(this));; return false;\">...more</a>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <span class=\"xhrCommentFooter greyText\">\n      Feb 09, 2016 09:51PM\n    </span>\n\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n\n</div>\n\n  </td>\n</tr>\n\n      </div>\n\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"clear\"></div>\n</div>\n\n    </div>"]}
