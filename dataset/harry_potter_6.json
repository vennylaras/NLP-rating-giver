And I enjoyed them, but I still hadn't plunged to the humiliating level of actually reading the books. Until that day, the day my daughter wanted to go swimming and I didn't. Feeling mightily compassionate and a little self sacrificing I grabbed the only book lying around at the time and sat at the side of the pool reading while my little princess played 'Dolphin'.All that is unrelated to the Book of course, but it's the best I could do to express how good this book was. You see I avoided Harry potter, avoided the books, wrote the subject off as below me. Maybe it was fate or perhaps just a little luck, whatever the case may be I picked up a book I wasn't interested in and instead of a distraction while waiting for my daughter to become one with the dolphins I was sucked in, like spilled ink into Hermione\u2019s wand, and engrossed with a wonderful story written by a brilliant author.I\u2019ve since read book 6 and started on 7; this series is good and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re too cool for magic or too manly for stories about children, you WILL enjoy this book. Don\u2019t believe me? Pick one up and read 4 chapters and then see if you can put it down and forget about it.Go ahead fellas, flame away\u2026 flame away."},

Every single chapter, sentence, word, grabbed at me! By this point in the series I'm seriously invested in the characters and the events going on around them, and Rowling has not done anything to them to upset me too much. Well, there is something that happens to one of my favorite characters at the end of the book, but I'm not going to spoil it because there are actually still people out there who have yet to read the book.The thing that is amazing about Rowling is that as Harry grows, her writing seems to grow as well. If you look back at the first book and compare it to the sixth book, the first book seems so childish, young, easy and simple, while the sixth book is the exact opposite. It also makes the books a lot more accessible to readers of all ages. Kids can start reading them on their own or with their parents, and adults can read them and reassure themselvest that they're not reading a kids book.There's so much I want to say about this book and this series, but... I can't without giving too much away. If you haven't read the series, you will be very lost if you start with this book, so start at the beginning. If you have read the series but haven't read this one yet, get it now and read it! It will not disappoint you at all! Once again, Rowling has out done herself.

Some would say the series had to end at some point and that the killings were not so bold. Ah, but many a publishing and movie executive would disagree and cry out, \"Why?! Why kill the cash cow?!?!\" Well, she did. Finally Rowling did kill it. She brought this whole satisfying series to an end, and this is its beginning."},

And though I loved this novel for many reasons, I find it quite difficult to separate it from the other tales. This, I think, speaks to J.K. Rowling's ability to connect the stories in a such a way that they each have their own identity while still continuing to trace a gigantic glowing arc through the sky along which the reader is able to ride from the first book to the seventh.So before I tell you a few things I loved about the novel, please know that there might be spoilers below. Not huge spoilers, mind you, but I'm always afraid of letting something slip. So...be forewarned. Don't read on if you haven't read this book yet. And if you haven't read the book, why are you reading a review of it by a writer whose skills don't yet approach J.K. Rowling's? Seriously. Get off the danged Internet and read this amazing series!Some delights and terrors and sorrows...1. Fenrir Greyback: Bet that surprised you a little. I know that this character played a relatively minor role, but on the page he was a scene-stealer, a flesh-chewer, and a perfect foil for one of my favorite character, Remus Lupin.An aside: About a year before I began reading the series, my Creative Writing class was discussing characterization. The kids began talking about the Harry Potter books. One remarked that the supporting characters were as interesting as the leads, which led another student to bring up Remus Lupin. She was halfway through her cataloging of his merits as a character when she stopped and looked up at me, as if seeing me anew. She then said, \"Mr. (Insert real name here). You sort of remind me of Lupin.\" When I later found out he was a werewolf, I was a little bit shocked (and secretly pleased). But when I really got to know the character, I found the remark incredibly gratifying.Back to Fenrir Greyback (with whom I hope I have nothing in common)...What made Greyback so incredibly interesting to me was not only the sheer ferocity of his behavior, but the diabolical simplicity of his motives. If the Harry Potter books were likened to Lord of the Flies and Voldemort's ambition were compared with Jack's (the leader of the hunters), then Greyback would be Roger, the sadist. This powderkeg of a character lives only to rend flesh and to guzzle the steaming lifeblood of his victims. Greyback doesn't want to rule the world; he simply wants to terrorize it. I don't know what kind of a role he plays in the seventh book (if any), but his unreasoning brutality added just the right note of menace to a book that largely---and sensitively---focused on the romantic relationships of its teenagers.2. Fleur's Surprising Reaction: I admit to falling prey to a stupid prejudice here, and I feel awful about it. But I wrongly assumed Fleur Delacour was a pretty face without a soul. In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire she was the object of many male desires (Ron's particularly), and though she was skilled at wizardry, she wasn't an especially affecting character. She did seem affected, however, and when she showed up again in Book Six, I, like Mrs. Weasley, rolled my eyes and dismissed her as a fluttery, vapid future supermodel.How wrong I was.One mark of a great writer, I think, is the ability to surprise the reader without cheating. That's J.K. Rowling. When something terrible befell Fleur's fiance, I was all set to mentally berate her for her superficiality. But rather than making a caricature out of Fleur---as I fear I unknowingly did---Rowling transformed her and made her deeply endearing with a couple elegant lines of dialogue.And I loved that. So here's to continual reminders to not judge people by appearances or even their seeming personalities. People can still surprise us, and we need to give them the opportunity to do so.*takes a deep breath*And lastly...3. Dumbledore: If you've read this far, you've only been assailed by minor spoilers. I don't want to spoil this plot twist, but I don't know how to talk about it without spoiling it. And the fact is, I don't want to talk about it.Rarely has a fictional character so resonated with me the way Albus Dumbledore has. In the first book he was wise, eccentric, and a constant source of comfort. As the series has developed, he has persisted in exhibiting those traits, but he has also grown more than most might think. He has revealed a penchant for trusting others too much. He has admitted how fallible he is, how prone to mistakes. He has been injured, accused of wrongdoing, and generally fed through a physical and emotional woodchipper.And he has come through it all with an open, caring heart and an enormous capacity for love. One passage in particular, I think, summarizes this amazing character for me. In a scene that chronicles how Tom Riddle became Lord Voldemort, Dumbledore attempts to gird Harry's resolve and confidence in the inevitable battle with his nemesis:\"Yes, you have,\" said Dumbledore firmly. \"You have a power that Voldemort has never had. You can---\"\"I know!\" said Harry impatiently. \"I can love!\" It was only with difficult that he stopped himself adding, \"Big deal!\"\"Yes, Harry, you can love,\" said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. \"Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.\"\"So, when the prophecy says that I'll have 'power the Dark Lord knows not,' it just means---love?\" asked Harry, feeling a little let down.\"Yes---just love,\" said Dumbledore.The above passage will strike some as too direct, too naive, or worst of all, too emotional.It struck me as incredibly beautiful. There are all sorts of belief systems in the world, and no two people are exactly alike in their beliefs. But what Dumbledore says here is something that, were it adopted by more people, would alter our world for the better. Harry, for all his flaws, usually acts with good intentions. He befriends Luna Lovegood (another one of my favorite characters in all of fiction), gives of himself to others, and is willing to suffer so that others won't have to experience the same pain. In other words, Harry loves.And so can Dumbledore. Which is why this book was so memorable, wonderful, and painful to me.I'm going to go now. My wife is making a delicious supper. My son and first daughter are ready to wrestle. And my three-year-old is racing around the house casting spells on the furniture with her Harry Potter stick.And for that, J.K. Rowling, I thank you."},

However, in the light of recent events (aka. Alan Rickman's death) I feel like I have enough inspiration for this review. As you can guess, it will be about Severus Snape (it seems to make sense, since he is the Half-Blood Prince after all.First of all, I have to say something really important: I read HP 1 to 4 at least 15 times each, HP 5 around 5 times and HP 6 and 7 twice each. It means that I have around 67 reading of \"mean-Snape\" and 2 reading of \"have-been-nice-since-the-start-Snape\". That is why I can say that I will never LOVE his character as much as I love others. No matter what. That's being said, I have to say that there is nothing purer and deeper than his love for Lily. I am used to read about mutual love, or even if that love isn't mutual, at the end, the guy finds someone else to love. This is really the first time I read about an unconditional love, which holds and stays no matter what. It overcame being friend-zoned by Lily, Lily's marriage to James, Lily's having a baby with that same person, and even Lily dying. After all those years, it is still Lily.Moreover, I guess that Slytherin's reputation is hard to get through. Even though I seem to have many qualities that they would like. Severus being one of their student and afterwards becoming their Head, didn't help me liking his character. But once again, this book (and the next one) proved me wrong. He is THE Half-Blood Prince. Smart, smarter than his school book, a talented wizard strong in both magic and potions. I mean he fought Voldemort as soon as he know that the love of his life was in danger, he became a double agent for the Order of the Phoenix, literally putting himself in great danger in order to protect her.  \u201cI have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter\u2019s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a pig for slaughter \u2014\u201d There are a lot of things we get to witness through the books that made my opinion of Severus Snape growing (for instance the frequent bullying of James Potter and Sirius Black, saving Harry in the first book from falling from his broom, killing Dumbledore on his own request). He is faithful to his love to Lily and his vow to Dumbledore, and faithfulness is an awesome quality to my opinion. He is a solitary man with no friends, and he is also capable to use sarcasms with great ability (and I love sarcastic characters)"},

Of course, constructing the finale around such a simple and direct concept for the ending of the conflict is easy for the author. However, it is formulaic and predictable for the reader, and robs us of actually seeing a physical and intellectual struggle between foes. Of course, this does not mean that they do not strive against one another, but by providing the separation of such a plot device, relocates the entire point-of-conflict to an arbitrary, external point. Thermal exhaust port, indeed.For more on such plot-specific concepts, please enjoy this article: http://www.ansible.co.uk/Ansible/plot....This book was mainly built to set up the finale, and feels in many ways to be less of a complete story than a 'second in a trilogy', without a real point and ending of its own, and reliant on the final chapter to decide its importance. This is also the book with the greatest adherence to actually surprising the audience with a main character death. At least, it would be, if it weren't unfortunately easy to match the emotional directives given to the characters by the author and recognize that what the author wants us to think shows us precisely what will happen. Misdirection is an art, but it should not have to be a martial one.Long story short, I unfortunately guessed the 'twist' and spent the greater part of this book watching the author try to throw red herrings in my path. A bit disappointing, but still a fairly interesting and exciting tale. The historical and character exploration provide some of the strongest elements in any of her books. It does not quite reach the heights in tone, emotion, or motivation of the last book, but she never does reach that height again.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"},

It's that semi-awkward stage book where it's going to lead to the last big-bang fight and wrap-up, has to introduce new stuff for the story but play on the old without wrapping that up just yet.Harry has lost his mope from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, feeling accepted again amongst his peers and not left out in the dark any longer, but he retains the natural anger and fear that he should have in his circumstance. There's some mini developments between him and a female character romantically wise, which to me fits the series well. Hermione and Ron also are leaning toward each other more, even if they haven't made it officially official just yet.If you're a fan of Dumbledore, this book will both please and infuriate you. He's in more scenes than ever while he gives Harry private lessons, showing both his and other people's memories, all leading to a fascinating backstory focusing on Voldemort. You don't actually get to see the monstrous villain in this book - you only hear about him, which is typical of the earlier installments. There's a few death eaters popping up though, including Fenrir, a new big-bad I hadn't noticed before, a demented werewolf of all things. Can I just say this guy is actually creepy? Especially his focus on hurting and turning children.As always these books are impossible to put down, since Rowling's writing technique not only rocks, but she gives us unique characters who are individuals standing out from each other while working toward standing together unified. Rowling always introduces a new stand-out character in books; here it's a new potions master who enjoys fame and getting to know students who he has determined are 'going places.' Dumbledore has something else up his sleeve about this teacher, too...Pacing wise it's okay, as this book is more of a filler than anything, but it does give us one big revelation concerning Voldemort. All the other books pointed toward this, but it's now more obvious coming together when Harry sees the larger picture. While a stepping stone to the next book, 'The Half-Blood Prince' is in no way boring. You get to see Harry with his friends and relationships, a little in the classes and especially wondering who on earth the Half-Blood prince is. That mystery intrigued me since I couldn't figure it out for awhile, and I'd forgotten since watching the movie years back.While the new potions teacher is introduced, Snape finally gets his turn at 'Defense against the Dark Arts.' I was slightly bummed we didn't get to see more time spent in his class, however. I've always enjoyed the classroom teaching and experiences in the other books, and here was a chance to see freaking SNAPE of all people talking about the dark arts! Unfortunately there's just the one classroom moment. Although we don't see too much on the teaching side, Snape is still brilliantly constructed and a page-stealer when he comes on scene.As with the previous book, there's a heartbreaking ending to this one, so have the tissues handy.I'll keep them handy when I go on to the next and last book, where I know more depressing stuff will happen. And of course I'll need tissues just knowing it's the last book and that it's time to get off this ride. :("},

Sin embargo, no siento que haya pasado demasiado tiempo.En este punto de la saga ya todo el mundo se da cuenta de lo elaborado de esta historia. De todas las tramas que se unifican y de todos los trasfondos que constituyen a los personajes para hacerlos tan reales como sea posible. Aqu\u00ed, todo m\u00e1s oscuro y dif\u00edcil, nos sumerge la autora en dif\u00edciles explicaciones sobre el desenlace que podr\u00eda tener esta secuencia de acontecimientos y el destino de cada uno de los que forman parte de ellos. Est\u00e1 demasiado bien trazado y hace que nos importe. No queda nada por fuera, todo est\u00e1 tan bien atado que la cadena de historias parece convertirse en un c\u00edrculo con el que uno termina familiariz\u00e1ndose. Al final todo se conecta.En este tomo las cosas han cambiado mucho. Harry regresa a Hogwarts pero la situaci\u00f3n no es la misma. Aqu\u00ed se profundiza much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s en muchos aspectos y se esclarecen algunas circunstancias en las que la seguridad de los personajes se ve amenazada, y creo que por tal raz\u00f3n salen a relucir muchas cosas que antes no ve\u00edamos.Surgen situaciones bastante cotidianas aun en medio del caos, y es divertido ver c\u00f3mo se alternan estos episodios tan comunes con los momentos m\u00e1s serios. La rutina no se detiene, y es precisamente en medio de la vida estudiantil en la que Harry descubre un elemento esencial y de mucha importancia en la historia, y aunque al principio solo le da un toque emocionante e interesante a los d\u00edas de Harry como alumno, al final se vuelve pr\u00e1cticamente el centro de todo y es donde se hallan algunas explicaciones.El final fue un choque, en definitiva. Hubo partes muy dif\u00edciles y muy tristes, pero nunca dej\u00f3 de ser esa emocionante monta\u00f1a rusa que nos conduc\u00eda por los rincones m\u00e1s insospechados y misteriosos de ese mundo que uno se podr\u00eda imaginar. Hubo tambi\u00e9n mucha alegr\u00eda en compensaci\u00f3n por los malos ratos y eso no es algo que pase yo por alto. Es un libro que inevitablemente causa mucha impresi\u00f3n. \u00a1Sucedieron much\u00edsimas cosas y tan de prisa! A veces ni siquiera daba tiempo de reaccionar porque se suced\u00edan los acontecimientos de una forma vertiginosa. Parte de ellos muy tristes. Muy dolorosos.Los personajesQu\u00e9 encantadores. Por Dios, qu\u00e9 encantadores. No solo aquellos que hicieron cosas buenas todo el tiempo, porque ese es el punto, fueron tan reales que todos, absolutamente todos, cometieron errores terribles alguna vez o tuvieron pensamientos errados incluso sobre personas a las que quer\u00edan. Hubo tanto de una cosa y de otra, tanto de la vida cotidiana de estudiantes y tambi\u00e9n de personas poco comunes que se enfrentaron con una oscuridad pensada invencible, y al final pudieron sostenerse entre estos dos mundos de normalidad y oscuridad con un equilibrio admirable. Y creo que fue todo por la compa\u00f1\u00eda que ten\u00edan. Porque se ten\u00edan los unos a los otros. Hubo esa t\u00edpica envidia y esos celos comunes entre compa\u00f1eros inseparables, disputas tontas entre amigos de verdad, competitividad, peleas, celebraciones, cuestiones adolescentes, y eso me caus\u00f3 una profunda calidez al leer este libro.Me gust\u00f3 porque, a fin de cuentas, las personas no son cobardes o valientes, sino que pueden tener momentos de ambas dependiendo de la situaci\u00f3n en la que se encuentren y de lo mucho que a ellos les importe.Me gust\u00f3 porque ten\u00eda a estas dos chicas tan diferentes pero al final tan valientes (Ginny y Hermione) y que hicieron de la lectura algo ameno y que disfrut\u00e9 mucho leer. Mis favoritas. Tan inteligentes, con la dosis justa de independencia pero tambi\u00e9n de la vulnerabilidad que las hace chicas.Me gust\u00f3 porque se ten\u00edan. Sobre todo por esa unidad inquebrantable, incorruptible. Eso hizo de este libro mi favorito de la saga. Pese a las p\u00e9rdidas, los errores, las malas decisiones, se ten\u00edan, y eso nunca cambi\u00f3 aunque les pusieran el mundo al rev\u00e9s. Aunque les sacudieran desde los cimientos, se ten\u00edan.No llegu\u00e9 a odiar a nadie. Todos se mostraron tan humanos en cierto momento. Hasta los que hac\u00edan las peores cosas estaban llenos de fragilidad y ten\u00edan esa esencia de personas con una debilidad en espec\u00edfico que les conduc\u00eda a actuar de tal o cual forma. Aunque muchas de sus acciones no eran justificables, tampoco carec\u00edan de fundamento. Todas ellas con un origen, una ra\u00edz, buena o mala. Ah\u00ed estaba. Con una historia. Injustas a veces, pero muy fundamentadas.En este espacio, hace un a\u00f1o, habl\u00e9 de lo mucho que me hab\u00eda resistido a leer esta saga. Aqu\u00ed, hace un a\u00f1o, habl\u00e9 de la de veces que me hab\u00edan insistido hasta que finalmente ced\u00ed y hasta ahora no me arrepiento, porque he aprendido sobre una gran escritora. De las cualidades tan marcadas que el mundo en general tiene y no deber\u00eda, o de las que s\u00ed, y de las que no tiene pero deber\u00eda desear adquirir. Mis respetos a Rowling."},

Oh yeah...While I've seen the movies, I completely forgot about the significant death scene at the end of this one. I think that's because I slept through the important parts of the final three films. I had a serious what the fuck moment at the end of this one, thinking to myself, \"He can't die. He's in the next book.\" While I was both wrong and right, I cannot believe I missed him dying in this one. That being said, his death was my favorite part of this book. Not that I didn't like the character, but because Rowling took a big chance killing him.Dan 2.0 mentioned that he was interested in how I, being a horror fan, would feel about the cave scene, so this paragraph is for him. I think being a horror fan actually detracted from my enjoyment of that section. Dead people just below the surface of the water goes as far back as Lord of the Rings. It has been used countless times throughout the genre. Most recently, The Woman in Black used this tactic. That's funny because Daniel Radcliffe is in both film adaptations. Anyway, the cave scene felt dated, but at the same time well written. Of course this goes back to Rowling's overuse use of the borrow button. But there's nothing new under the sun, right? Not every book can be The Fold. ;)To those of you expecting a rage review, my apologies. I think those days are behind us, at least where this series is concerned. Spoiler alert, I actually liked the next book too. In summation: Everyone told me these books got better, but I did not believe them. Took me longer to get invested than most, but it finally happened. While I still don't care about these characters nearly enough to fan flail over their deaths and successes, I understand why some do. The lore is rich, even if it is borrowed from every other fantasy book in existence. Final Judgment: The least suckiest."},

Well, enjoyed isn't the right word because this entire book is pain in all of its glory. Our heroes are grown, fully-grown. They have come face to face with their mortal enemy and have to stand up against him. This book has everything, from twists and turns to death and pain and tragedy. One word: White Tomb. If you've read the book then you know what I'm talking about. You know how it all affected Harry, not just his heart but his soul as well.They have all realized how series this is and that it's not a game where if you die you can come back to life. If you die you stay dead and that's about it.Coming-of-age isn't enough to sum this series. You begin with The Philosopher's Stone not knowing what you just got yourself into. It's all fun and the world sounds so fun, dangerous too, but fun is the one word defining it. How should we know that the world of Wizardry would fall apart like this? How could we have guessed that pain would be the defining world for this now? Loss pain. It's all about not being alone. Not working alone against the evil but constantly having someone to have your back and be there when you need them. The struggle is real, pals. "},

Having allowed us to watch Harry evolve and mature for so many years, Rowling finally lifts the veil, so to speak, humanizing the larger than life characters of not just Dumbledore and Snape, but significantly and achingly, Tom Riddle. This is love letter to one of the hardest things we all experience: the moment that your idols become your peers, your parents become your friends, and your superiors your equals, when you realize we're all in this together and that it is nobody's job to shelter you, and when, finally, you realize that people are absolutely human.Rowling's affection for her characters and her sympathy for even the most vile of her creations (the Malfoys and Voldemort himself) are at the heart of Harry Potter's lasting beauty and insight. Here, she explores her three most fascinating creations, and one wishes the story would never end. But it does, and when it does, Harry is faced with the same challenge that Rowling subjects her readers to: how much faith do you really have in what you've been told, and do you believe, at the end of the day, that good really does win out?A timeles classic. One of my favorites, ever."},

At the end there, especially, I couldn't put the audio down so I was wandering about my house in a blind daze listening instead.And because every human and their fluffy poodle has probably sensibly reviewed this book, BAH. I'm just going to make a list of things I loved and things I didn't. My Intense And Passionate LOVES:\u2022 Harry + Ginny = yes. I was dubious at first. Like I think romance is NOT JKR's strong point...plus when she gets to a romantic scene she ends the chapter. HHAHAH. ADORABLE. (Not that I minded, I just...I think she's not good at romance.) But omg, there was that moment after the Quidditch match??? YUP. You know what I'm talking about. Excuse me, my heart just ran around in circles screaming and shipping.\u2022 Hermione: I adore her, but...I gotta admit, she was a little bit too stuffy. BUT I STILL LOVE HER. I love her love for learning.\u2022 I also adore how sensible Ginny is. \u2022 Fred and George's joke shop gives life. Also death, probs, but liiiiife.\u2022 I am utterly in LOVE with the whole concept of Hogwarts. I mean, I think it's stupid that they have to write with a quill and ink (can't they just enchant the quill to write for them?) and they seem to get an excessive amount of homework, BUT. It's all so vivid and detailed and it literally feels like Hogwarts is A REAL PLACE. I totally get why people wail about their letters going missing. \u2022 Speaking of detail...me likey. I always felt inside the story.\u2022 Plus the audio book (narrated by Jim Dale) is GREAT. I totally recommend it. I think Hermione's voice had a tendency to sound like an insufferable goat, but I got used to it. Harry's voice was perfection. \u2022 I also particularly liked Harry in this book. I JUST LOVE HARRY. u0026lt;3 He's snarky, but he's lost some of the angriness from bk 5. He's got snarky quips at the ready, but he's also intensely...good. Like he's just a really GOOD chap, who makes bad decisions but really means well. ZOMG. *flails about* He was definitely my favourite character in this book. \u2022 ALSO DUMBLEDORE WAS GREAT. I love Dumbledore and how he's always polite and kind and smiley. (view spoiler)[ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS. THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BUT IT SHOULDN'T. BECAUSE NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Dumbledore. no. Come baaaaaaaack. *breaks down into a mess* I am also intensely furious that his weakening himself to get the horcrux was useless. MAD. Okay? I AM MAD. Character deaths where they failed are the worst there are.  (hide spoiler)]My Intense and Passionate LOATHES:(Hhahahha...you ready for this?)\u2022 Okay so, question: WHY do they sometimes go places and buy food...and sometimes they just magic it? Like Mrs. Weasely magics onion soup out of nothing for Harry. But in the next chapter, Harry and Ron are peeling sprouts. LIKE WUT. This makes no sense to me. \u2022 Why didn't Dumbledore pour the evil potion on the ground instead of drinking it? Just wannna know...\u2022 How the FLYING FRIKKIN BROOMSTICKS can anyone possibly convince me Snape is still on the good side? Because I don't even care. He can go abra kadabra himself to Timbuktu and DIE THERE THANKS. There is no repentance after this. I don't even care what the \"reason\" is in book 7, but Harry: you are an idiot to name your kid after Snape. \u2022 I HOPE SNAPE DIES.\u2022 DID I MENTION MY HATE FOR SNAPE YET???????\u2022 Oh and another thing...I am so angry at Snape arghhhqqwqq.\u2022 Okay. Good now. I'm calm. Thank you. \u2022 HAHHAHHAHAHTE SNAPE.\u2022 Yes, I truly am calm this time. I'm good.\u2022 So. I also am fairly annoyed about Voldermort's (Tom Riddle) backstory. Because he read like he was straight out of a psychopath text book...which I found monstrously unimaginative. Attractive, calm, subtle bully, kleptomaniac, limited emotional reach, charmer, smooth...blah blah. Yes. I can just read a book about psychopaths and that's Voldey's description. I wish there'd been a little more ingenuity in there.\u2022 I really also dislike Ron. I KNOW. Travesty. But he's a bully! He was bullying first year's the whole time...turfing tem off chairs, scaring them, bossing them around, taking stuff off them in the name of \"prefect\". Like how is that good?? How is that okay??? I will not forgive Ron for all this. And also the fact that he's a downright BRUTE to Hermione. How can I ship them when he's so rude and demeaning to her?? I DON'T. Hermione deserves better. And I don't buy the \"She completes him by sorting him out\" because I think all humans should take responsibility for their actions. Hermione shouldn't HAVE to force Ron into a better person and be his conscious. AGH. \u2022 Not shipping that. ^^\u2022 Okay, I'm done. But just *whispers* I hate hate hate Snape. So basically YES, I had a fantastic time with this book. I loved the audio. I loved the story. I loved Harry and the world just feels so big and rich and visual. I get the intense fandom for this I DO GET IT. After being so angry and 1000% done in with book 3, I can successfully say I can't WAIT to read the last book now. And then watch all the movies. And then I'll finally be caught up, omg. Only took me like 10 years. [ CAN WE TALK A MINUT EHOW I'M NOT OKAY THAT HE'S DEAD?!??!?!? LIKE WHAT EVEN THE FLYING HECK OF BROOMS NEST TAILS.

I had resisted this popular phenomenon until I was forced to pick it up for a grade, and Book 1 was short enough that I could read it in the course of 2 hours. I have to admit I wasn\u2019t impressed to any extent, nor did I dislike the experience, but I was critical on grounds of its being derivative, even if reading the first led to reading the second. After all, if I was bored and looking for something light, I could do worse than a fantasy about a child wizard who fights evil with his friends. But it was really the third book, with its increasing darkness, that took me in and made me a fan. With a movie coming out for Order of Phoenix and Deathly Hallows on the horizon, I decided I would reread Half-Blood Prince. I figured it would take four sittings, of course, with its 600 pages, but time does fly when reading this one, and I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that this is my favorite so far. What I wouldn\u2019t have been willing to admit in college that I\u2019m perfectly comfortable saying now is that J.K. Rowling is a fantastic storyteller; she writes with great clarity, wit, and humor; and she\u2019s created a cast of loveable characters with whom most people, due to the common experience of growing up, can relate closely. That said, the reason for my preference for the 6th book is that it\u2019s the most emotionally rich in the series. Here we get the backstory of Voldemort (*spoiler alert*) through a series of flashbacks (coming in HP by way of magically extracted memories), and in this way, we come to understand the villain\u2019s similarities and differences with our hero. After all, the villain has to have reasons for committing heinous acts, and until now, we don\u2019t know what these are.Voldemort is from a once-powerful wizard family reduced to poverty that lives in a dilapidated hovel on the edge of a small town, wary of outsiders, and their main point of pride is their pure blood, the lineage having cross-bred for generations so as not to pollute the line. Voldemort\u2019s mother lives with her father and brother and yearns for the love of a nonmagical man (\u201cmuggle\u201d in this world) and when her father and brother are arrested, she uses the opportunity to bewitch her beloved and run off. She ends up pregnant, the man deserts her, and she dies while giving birth to her half-wizard, half-muggle son, thus making him an orphan (like Harry).(Faulkner anyone?)But whereas Harry comes to Hogwarts and befriends Ron and Hermione creating unity and strength through positive emotions, Voldemort, when growing in the orphanage shuns other children, torturing them at times (without the awareness of adults) and stealing their possessions. What fuels him is his hatred of his beginnings, his mother\u2019s weakness at having died like a common person despite being a witch, and the \u201cmuggle\u201d blood inherited from his father. Over the course of his time at Hogwarts, Voldemort, charming as only evil can be, learns to win over people as a means to an end and disguise his insidious purposes, but he never befriends anyone. He moves, through his hatred, further away from many of the emotions that drive Harry, namely the desire to protect the people he loves and avenge his parents\u2019 death.With Dumbledore\u2019s help in exploring Voldemort\u2019s past, Harry begins to understand that he\u2019s come to be where he is through the choices he\u2019s made, that his greatest strengths are an alliance with his friends, and that this might hold the key to destroying his enemy, a fact that\u2019s made all the more poignant when Dumbledore, in an all-out assault on Hogwarts by Voldemort\u2019s Death Eaters, is killed at the end. The stakes are higher than before, the action and pace increase as the conclusion draws near, and things are looking darker than ever, which is the setup that any fan wants when the end is looming and it leaves us with the question: How will our hero prevail?"},

It is practically impossible to find anything new to say after literally everybody and their brother read and discussed the series. Still it was interesting to see some people try to pretend everything is fine and perfect (Hermione and Ron firmly fall into this category) while others like Harry being obsessed with suspecting other people - in Harry's case his suspicions of Draco Malfoy made him practically paranoid and acting retarded at times. Some spoilers follow. Is it still possible to find anybody who have not read the series or watched the movies? If you are one of such rarities, stop right here!!! Harry and Ginny romance came out of nowhere and feels very artificial. My old cynical self does not think Ginny is a good match for Harry. Why would anybody want to have a girlfriend whose only positive quality is to throw hexes around - for little or no reasons I might add? Hermione on the other hand was always there for Harry.

Rowling created scores of Luna Lovegood fans with hilarious and bizarre commentary from the most unlikely Quidditch commentator.* The effects of Felix Felicis.* We get a fascinating view of the history of Tom Riddle.* The major question of the book: Whose side is Snape really on?Amazon Review:The long-awaited, eagerly anticipated, arguably over-hyped Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince has arrived, and the question on the minds of kids, adults, fans, and skeptics alike is, \"Is it worth the hype?\" The answer, luckily, is simple: yep. A magnificent spectacle more than worth the price of admission, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will blow you away. However, given that so much has gone into protecting the secrets of the book (including armored trucks and injunctions), don't expect any spoilers in this review. It's much more fun not knowing what's coming--and in the case of Rowling's delicious sixth book, you don't want to know. Just sit tight, despite the earth-shattering revelations that will have your head in your hands as you hope the words will rearrange themselves into a different story. But take one warning to heart: do not open Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince until you have first found a secluded spot, safe from curious eyes, where you can tuck in for a good long read. Because once you start, you won't stop until you reach the very last page. A darker book than any in the series thus far with a level of sophistication belying its genre, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince moves the series into murkier waters and marks the arrival of Rowling onto the adult literary scene. While she has long been praised for her cleverness and wit, the strength of Book 6 lies in her subtle development of key characters, as well as her carefully nuanced depiction of a community at war. In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, no one and nothing is safe, including preconceived notions of good and evil and of right and wrong. With each book in her increasingly remarkable series, fans have nervously watched J.K. Rowling raise the stakes; gone are the simple delights of butterbeer and enchanted candy, and days when the worst ailment could be cured by a bite of chocolate. A series that began as a colorful lark full of magic and discovery has become a dark and deadly war zone. But this should not come as a shock to loyal readers. Rowling readied fans with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix by killing off popular characters and engaging the young students in battle. Still, there is an unexpected bleakness from the start of Book 6 that casts a mean shadow over Quidditch games, silly flirtations, and mountains of homework. Ready or not, the tremendous ending of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince will leave stunned fans wondering what great and terrible events await in Book 7 if this sinister darkness is meant to light the way."},

Personally however, I may have enjoyed this one more. Mostly because there are few things I enjoy more than backstory. And while this series lacks a lot in many aspects, it does have a bunch of wildly interesting characters. Dumbledore and Snape are definitely among them.

Well plotted twist from J K -which won't stop twisting the plot cleverly specially in Snape's character- Also there's a depth in Draco's character that really serve the plot of this and next book.Then the guardian role of Dumbledore at Harry's life start to manifest at that book. Then the atmosphere of the life in the wizardry world -like the Diagon ally scene was darker than ever. And there's also the romance which is increase at that part due to the coming of age.

I was nervous to read it again because as it was my favourite the first time I read the series, I was anxious to see if maybe I would be let down. I completely understand why this was my favourite of the series, and still so far is. I connect the most with the characters and the feelings that they are faced with throughout this book. I am bawling my eyes out as I write this review, and with good reason. The death of Dumbledore is earth shattering, and the grave nature of this situation is delivered perfectly. This book is the darkest, I believe, of the series, as Voldemort's reign begins to take place. The fear, and frustration is eminent throughout every word; however, there is lightheartedness throughout. Delving into Voldemort's past is one of the unique aspects portrayed in this book. It's incredibly fascinating to learn the history of the darkest wizard of all time. There is so much we learn, and so much more we can guess about him, which is the sign of a great writer. J.K. Rowling allows the reader to figure things out on their own and take their own ideas from what she gives. It is impossible to lose interest as you discover more and more of this story. However, the biggest and most prominent reason of why this book speaks to me so deeply is because of Draco Malfoy. This is his story, his book, no matter how many ways one can look at it. He is so complex, very smart, troubled, hurt, confused, misunderstood, but nevertheless, strong in his beliefs. He loves his family and will do anything to protect them. Something that I didn't notice the first time I read the books, which I can see now, is that Draco is skilled at hiding his thoughts from intruders, which means that he is skilled in Occlumency. I adore him and it's crazy how one can learn so many things about their favourite character that they didn't know before just by paying attention to detail. This chills me to my core. I connect with him on so many levels, and although this is odd to many people, because they see him as a villain, he is not, and I truly respect him with everything I have. He knows love, perhaps more than even Harry, as he is willing to do what it takes to protect his family. He deserves a chance, just like so many others, as there are many layers to his character. There is so much that I can say about him, but I will keep it at that. I will always cherish this story with all my might. This book destroys me in the best possible ways."},

It was perfect, and also had me lol'ing throughout the whole thing..eh, mostly. not the end.\ufeffThe school and classes scenes were also amazing, that's weirdly one of the things I love most about these books. Hogwarts just being Hogwarts.If I'm being honest, weirdly again, the Quidditch scenes sometimes \ufeffbecome a little tedious to me sometimes, but I even loved those in this book, they were just so funny. Thankyou Liquid Luck. (\ufeff\ufeffthat was amazing, hahaha) The Apparition lessons were also a great laugh!J.K. Rowling is brilliant in everything she does; the humour, suspense, mystery... I mean, she even had me guessing and confused even though I've seen the movies a billion times.I loved getting to delve deeper into the motives and life of Voldemort, it was just so interesting to learn about his past, and what makes him such a complex character. As well as seeing the relationships, or lack of, with him and other people.The love aspect of this book, oh the loveeee, was so cute to read about. I mean, between Ron and Hermione, and Harry and Ginny, how could it not be good? You could really see them growing up throughout this novel, which I also enjoyed.The relationship between Harry and Dumbledore grew even more in this book (which made the ending that much harder) I've always loved reading about the dynamic between those two. Such a bond.Malfoy, well he was such an interesting character in this one, right from the moment when he stepped on Harry's nose *wince*, that was intense. It was so cool to be able to read about the mystery behind this guy, and try to figure him out a bit more. Draco has always fascinated me, which is probably half to do with Tom Felton, let's be real.Snape, uhm, I'm still kinda confused where I stand in regards to if I like or don't like him, at the moment it's a bit of both. I guess the Deathly Hallows will help me out, but I do really enjoy reading about Snape, even if he makes some...questionable decisions.Can't forget to mention Slughorn! He was a great addition to the story, I really enjoyed his character, and all that he brought to the novel.Once again, the friendship between Ron/Harry/Hermione warmed my little heart, and also tore at it a bit over the course of the novel *cough* thanks Lavender *cough*. But they never fail to make me smile. I feel like even though there was still a bit of it, the angst levels were much lower in this one, haha.Also, how can you not love Fred and George? I adore those two, they're like me in twin boy form. All-in-All, this was yet another solid addition to this amazing series, and it's just incredible how much more I'm getting out of the books than the movies, I really didn't expect to learn this much. Admittedly, I didn't even truly know what a Horcrux was until this book...oops.Can't believe it's time for the final journey..."},

I also still don't how Bill fell in love with her but yeah, she is pretty but I thought Bill deserved someone better than her. I like Bill so much. he is so cool with his red long hair. maybe I didn't like Phlegm because I was jealous hahahaha okay it is not maybe, I was jealous. but look at this scene : ''E is always so thoughtful,' purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes and Ron thumped him on the back.ugh ... how could I like her if she acted like that?!? that was really annoying and Ginny also found it disgusting. Hermione and Ginny didn't even like her. but she changed my mind on the the end of this book because when Bill was attacked by ... that werewolf guy who bit Remus when he was a kid. Bill is no longer as handsome as he used to be but Fleur still loves him. she doesn't care about how he looks and I even thought she would leave him after he was attacked but she didn't and that time I changed my mind about her. She is the right girl for Bill, even though I am a little bit jealous hahaha xD  Ron and HermioneI ship these two so much and I really really like Ron. Ron and Hermione are always funny. they always bicker about something and I think the first time Ron fell in love with Hermione was on the book four because he was so angry when he knew Hermione went to the Yule Ball with Viktor Krum and in this book Ron hurt me so much. He thought that Hermione kissed Krum and he was so angry and jealous because of this and he kissed Lavender in the common room that was full of people and it also broke Hermione's heart. Harry looked into the corner she was indicating. There, in full view of the whole room, stood Ron wrapped so closely around Lavender Brown it was hard to tell whose hands were whose.I remember very clearly that I cried so much till my eyes were red and puffy and that time I kept saying that I hated him and I didn't care about him but saying that seemed useless because I kept crying and crying. That time I wanted to hurt Ron's heart too, I wanted him to feel the exact pain Hermione felt when she saw him kissing Lavender. 'Er - my - nee,' croaked Ron unexpectedly from between them. but all my anger was gone when he was poisoned and he said that while he was asleep. I think he was trying to say Hermione, so that meant he dreamt about her and I forgave him that exact time and he also didn't really like Lavender anymore since then. he even pretended to be asleep when Lavender came to visit him in the hospital wing. so that meant he didn't like her anymore and I don't think he actually liked Lavender before he was poisoned. I think he just kissed Lavender because he wanted to make Hermione jealous and feel hurt, which he successfully did.   Harry And Ginnyhave you ever thought why Ginny had relationship with quite many guys? wait ... not many guys because she just dated two boys, Dean and Michael. But she always got a boyfriend as soon as she split up with her ex and my thoughs about this is probably right because Ginny said this to Harry on the end of the book 'I never really gave up on you,' she said. 'Not really. Ialways hoped ... Hermione told me to get on with life, maybe go out with some other people, relax a bit around you, because I never used to be able to talk if you were in the room, remember? And she thought you might take a bit more notice if I was a bit more - myself.' I think Ginny always dated a guy as soon as she split up with her ex because she always tried to forget Harry, so maybe if she had a boyfriend, she wouldn't love Harry anymore. But according to what she said she never really gave up on Harry so that means she has always loved him. I was a bit sad when Harry said they can't be together again because Harry was afraid if something would happen to Ginny if they kept seeing each other. he was afraid if Voldemort used Ginny to get him. but I didn't angry with him because this just proved how much Harry loves Ginny and I am sure they will be together again. I hope so ...   Dumbledore's deathI admit that Dumbledore is not one of my top favorite characters in this series but I always found him funny and a bit weird, in a good way, of course. But his death left me in shock because he was actually pleading to Snape but Snape killed him with The Avada Kedavra curse and I thought Snape was on the good side. What will happen now after Dumbledore died?! He is the only one Voldemort is afraid of. I have this feeling that I'll to lose my favorite characters again ... thank you so much for reading and liking my review. hope you all have a great weekend, guys! "},

Even though he is evil, you can\u2019t deny that he is a mastermind. The romance was entertaining and comedic which was a good thing since it put all the seriousness on hold for awhile. It\u2019s incredible seeing how much darker the books and films get since Philosopher\u2019s Stone. I thoroughly enjoyed each minute I spent reading this novel and in no way did I feel as if it was dragged out. Every single chapter was essential to the whole Wizarding World. The characters become much more complex in the Half Blood Prince and J.K. Rowling does an outstanding job in developing them. This was such a detailed novel that I will have to revisit once I start the whole series over. "},

One would be even more afraid of him after getting to know bits of his past, and indeed, I was, but I was more intrigued by his character than afraid of him.As for the... death in this book (you know which one I'm talking about)... I don't know if it's the same for you as it is with me, but I found it more shocking than sad. I think that's because of all the things happeing around. There were so many surprises revealed, and the book only got more and more intense.But of course, Dumbledore isn't really gone if there are still loyal people to him, isn't that true? What I sure will miss are his words of wisdom, some of which I carry with me as if they were a treasure, like this one I took from this book:It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.And with reason I did. I mean, how true is that?Now I will reread the last book. I know what expects me is lots of darkness, death, and even more surprised than the ones revealed previously in the series.

In general, no-one tends to come out and say 'Terry Pratchett is a very poor writer of dialogue', for the simple reason that evidently he isn't.The second group are those authors who really aren't very good at writing, but who can churn out intriguing, if often illogical, plots which hold the attention in much the same way that soap operas do. Jeffrey Archer although apparently a self-serving ex-criminal, is the most obvious example of this second breed (as a teenager I once read Archer's Kane and Abel whilst on a family holiday in a Bu0026amp;B in Fort William and it was perfectly acceptable stuff - certainly much more attention-grabbing than the pile of Zane Grey westerns which were the place's only other literary offerings). People frequently do come out and say things like 'Jeffrey Archer is a very poor writer of dialogue' which is fair enough comment because equally evidently he is exactly that. Which is not to say that he can't tell a story - and that is an accusation not often levelled at him.All of which apparent digression brings me to JK Rowling's penultimate Harry Potter book, \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\". One in three hardbacks sold in the UK are written by Ms Rowling and, if the papers are to be believed, she made \u00a320 million in the first day of sale of this novel. The series regularly tops reader polls as best children's books ever and Ms Rowling is now the richest woman in Britain (possibly the Universe). She was even, it is rumoured, invited by Russell T Davies to write a story for the rebirth of smsh hit tv series, \"Doctor Who\". To suggest that Ms Rowling is a less than stellar writer and that - for instance - Ursula K LeGuin's \"Earthsea\" trilogy is so far above Harry Potter as to be invisible is presumably just the type of intellectual snobbery mentioned above.And yet her new book is - and apologies in advance for the profanity - bloody awful.So awful that it would never have been published had it been written by anyone other than JKR.So awful that even the sycophantic drone at Bloomsbury who...ahem...edits the Rowling manuscripts must have winced.So awful that even the author appears to recognise that she's putting no effort in any more.So awful that everyone involved should be throughly ashamed of themselves.\"The Half-Blood Prince\" has the story's hero spending much of his time (several hundred pages in fact) doing something which does not need doing, simply in order (a) to have him doing anything at all and (b) waste some time. Dumbledore clearly already knows what has passed between Professor Slughorn and Lord Voldemort, so there is no need for Harry to spend so much time on the subject, other than artificially boosting the pagecount. What makes this particuarly galling is that Rowling knows that what she's doing is rubbish - there's even an explicit reference to the fact that the hero need not have been Harry but could just as easily have been the ineffectual Neville.We should, however, really be glad that Rowling's third-rate rip-off of the Origins of Gollum section of Lord of the Rings (which makes up much of the 'plot' and which is the supposed reason for Harry's enquiries of Slughorn) does take up such an incredibly large part of the book as it at least prevents Rowling shoe-horning in yet more tedious, badly written and shallow bits of teenage love and snogging. This is a book bought mainly by ten to fourteen year olds after all, and if they want romantic teen angst they can presumably go out and buy a Jacqueline Wilson book, rather than this hand-me-down tat.In any case, once the 'Lord Voldemort is Smeagol' and 'Harry meets Ginny' sections are over, there's only about 150 pages left of the 607 page book and we're heading helter-skelter for the Obligatory Dead Hero section of the book - by my count this is the third book in a row where one of the good guys is killed.Surprisingly perhaps, given the emotional impact Rowling managed to put into the death of Sirius Black in the last book, the O.D.H here is just as poorly done as the rest of the book, and although you can easily conjecture ways in which the scene might make more sense and have a greater impact in light of the final book in the series, it's very hard to care enough to try. Which is something of an achievement in itself when you're talking about the death of a key and sympathetic character the reader has been following for five previous books.Which leaves the mystery of just who is the Half-Blood Prince? Who cares? The solution in the end is a Pull-the-Never-Mentioned-Previously-Rabbit-Out-the-Hat affair that you couldn't possibly have guessed given the available evidence, but it doesn't matter because you won't care. The character of the Half-Blood Prince, once revealed, is neither believable, nor interesting, nor even very necessary. It's just more page-filler, saying in fifty thousand words what a good writer could have said in fifteen (not 15 thousand, just 15).'Harry is tempted to cut corners and can be a little bit bad sometimes' - there you go, that's only 14 and I'm not a writer of any description.As someone recently mentioned on one of the mailing lists I frequent, the whole 'Harry thinks Snape is up to no good, Ron and Hermoine aren't sure, and Dumbledore isn't saying' shtick is now well past its sell-by date and increasingly seems to be the only idea Rowling has for a Potter book. Here that idea reaches a potential conclusion and, frankly, I was bored stupid by just how lacklustre, lazy and badly done it all was."},

Pero Harry tiene el a\u00f1o en el que debe conocer mejor a su enemigo y Dumbledore le ayudar\u00e1 a desvelar un poco el misterio del pasado de Voldemort.Tengo una cosa y es que la sexta pel\u00edcula es la que menos he visto por eso leer el libro me trajo muchas cosas buenas para refrescarme la memoria. Suena raro siendo \u00e9ste el material original. Pero bueno, que el asunto es que este libro es la novela donde m\u00e1s profundizaci\u00f3n se da a muchas decisiones de los personajes y claro est\u00e1, la raz\u00f3n por la que el se\u00f1or tenebroso es quien es. En una parte se alterna el pasado con el presente en la que Harry va entendiendo la forma de proceder del mayor enemigo del mundo m\u00e1gico y con los pasos de Dumbledore van ententiendo qu\u00e9 deben hacer contra \u00e9l.Pero la novela siempre alterna los momentos m\u00e1s oscuros con otras cosas de la vida como la rutina estudiantil, los peligros que existen fuera del colegio y la vida de los adolescentes propia de la edad.  Harry, Ron y Hermione est\u00e1n en plenas hormonas y pelean bastante, adem\u00e1s de que surgen amor\u00edos y dem\u00e1s situaciones muy divertidas como inc\u00f3modas. La llegada del profesor Horace Slughorn para ser el nuevo maestro de Pociones y la llegada de cierto libro de pociones a Manos de Harry, lleno de garabatos de un tal Pr\u00edncipe Mestizo le da un toque a todo el asunto porque su presencia ser\u00e1 de vital importancia.

There is no safe place anymore, HarrySome books instantly remind me of winter, this is one of them; but it is much more than the fact that I started reading this one next to a wood burning stove, covered in blankets. This book is cold. There is a tinge of bitterness and melancholy since the beginning, really; you can feel it while reading, some parts even make you feel sad. What happened at the end of Order of the Phoenix brought with it a promise of global change and it's almost palpable now. There is no safe place anymore, Harry can trust very few people and even some of those he trusted to be friends still refuse to believe what he says about Voldemort, even though there could not be clearer evidence of his return. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed this book from start to finish; I love how Rowling changed the whole pattern of the books from \"summer time; Hogwarts; problems; adventures\" to a real quest to defeat Voldemort.Differently from previous books, on this one nothing of particular impact happens to Harry before the new semester at Hogwarts begins. The only significant event that I can recall is Dumbledore using him as a human magnet to attract a new, supposedly, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. So we are introduced to Slughorn, which I liked from minute one. In my opinion, he is one of the most believable characters that Rowling ever created. Most of the wizards (not considering Harry, his friends and the majority of the Weasleys) display a certain stoic behavior; some of them, like professor McGonagall, for instance, don't even express much emotion during the entire series. Slughorn, on the other hand, is a Russian roulette of conflicting emotions since his introduction. He feels proud of most of his acquaintances, ashamed of some, afraid of others. He feels attracted to the opportunity of being a teacher which would allow him to meet even more talented people, but afraid of what impact the exposure as a teacher would make in his life now that the world of wizards is being set upside down.Well, after this events, Harry is sent to the Weasleys', where nothing really meaningful happens. Then we have the customary travel to Hogwarts, where some enmities are reinforced, we might say. I must say that the atmosphere at school is utterly different from any of the other books. Some students didn't even return to school, so afraid they were, which I don't quite remember happening before, even when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened on book two.As soon as the semester starts, Dumbledore starts inviting Harry to private conversations at his office, so we start to realize what this book is really about: send normal school affairs to the dumps, let's investigate Voldemort's past so we might come up with some way to defeat him. I found it great how Rowling added rebellious teenager behavior to back up Harry not caring much about school anymore, focusing on his new found mission. It added a much more believable sense to the character and to the whole story itself. Anyway, during the whole book we get to know, through collected memories of people who interacted with Voldemort during some points of his existence, a lot of unimaginable and priceless information which helps us understand what drove him to become what he is now: a monster.Setting Harry's mission apart for an instant, I would like to mention how fun some parts of this book were, due to the tinge of \"sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll\" that Rowling displayed. There are constant love conflicts, hormones are exploding everywhere; even Hermione, which I could never guess cared much about people, was found crying in the corners, feeling alone and betrayed. Again, giving young wizards a little bit of \"muggle\" adolescence hell was very well done in the sense that it makes the story much more believable.As the story goes on, Dumbledore and Harry get closer and closer to uncovering Voldemort's deepest secret, which leads them to go outside Hogwarts in search of evidence. Unfortunately, the results of their little adventure are disastrous. Getting advantage over Dumbledore's momentary absence from Hogwarts, the dark forces find their way into the castle and things get really bad. Rowling is not afraid anymore, so the signs of her advanced \"George R. R. Martin syndrome\" are firmly displayed, which makes me take a star out of this book. The ending is bitter and sad, setting a clear path to what we can expect on the final book.  Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review:  It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.  Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.Re-read 11/2016 \u201cAnd now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\u201d        5 Ninja-Bunnehs-Riding-Brooms\"I am not worried, Harry, I am with you.\"Five breathtaking, heartbreaking, flashing, utterly blinding stars.This book has to be my favorite Harry Potter book thus far.

My eyes had trouble getting hydration, because I couldn't even close them for a millisecond, I was so focused and obsessed with the book. The plot thickens this time around, and we delve into Voldemort's past, which was something that had always made me curious. I cried many tears, whilst reading this book. Not just sad tears, but joyful, ecstatic ones too. My obsession with Ron u0026amp; Hermione and Harry u0026amp; Ginny grew 175388328474 times more, I actually felt an intense pain once Harry had to do what he'd been dreading at the end.

Even though I read it over a month ago the feelings of yes yes this is why everyone loves this series so much thank you yes still reverberate throughout my being when I think about it. This sixth installment incorporated a perfect mixture of action, romance, mystery, and wizardly happenings. All of the overarching plot lines: the romances between Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione, the disappearance of Dumbledore, the continuing evolution of the prophecy, etc. came together to create a captivating story full of twists and fresh, likeable characters. While this one and the seventh book are tied in terms of being my favorite, if I had to choose one book that really captured the essence of Harry Potter, I'd probably pick this one.My favorite moments revolved around Ron and Hermione. I loved their mutual jealousy and affection and how neither of them succumbed to insta-love. Overall I would recommend this to any fans who enjoyed books 1-4; the quality of this installment makes the hot mess that was the fifth book a distant memory.Okay okay I think this one is one of my favourites. I just finished it, I'm speechless. Ughhh I feel annoyed, sad, happy and everything at once. I really love the character development and the relationships and EVERYTHING. I feel that I've got more and more attached to the characters. I seriously can't express my feelings. I'm in love with this one. I can't believe I'm one book away from finishing the series. No, please.Too many feels rn! Here are my favorite and oh so shocking moments from this book: http://youtu.be/MIBYe7oqgi8?aCheck it outToo many feels rn!

I remember when this book was originally released. I'd gotten into the Harry Potter phenomenon late, after the 5th book was out, and during the time before Half-Blood Prince was out, I'd read and re-read the first 5 books... A LOT. So then comes the 6th book's release, and by this time, I'm just as rabid for it as everyone else. I need to know what's happened. I need to know whether Sirius... but no.

I'd gotten into the Harry Potter phenomenon late, after the 5th book was out, and during the time before Half-Blood Prince was out, I'd read and re-read the first 5 books... A LOT. So then comes the 6th book's release, and by this time, I'm just as rabid for it as everyone else. I need to know what's happened. I need to know whether Sirius... but no. What I really need to know is What Will Harry Do Now? The day comes, and, at the time, I was working a late shift. I got out of work at 11:15pm, raced to the bookstore for the midnight release... and found it closed, dark, and the parking lot nearly empty when I got there at 11:30. OH! I was LIVID. I immediately, literally standing in the parking lot, called the bookstore and ripped the manager a new one. The book releases at MIDNIGHT. I HAD A PRE-ORDER!! You don't get to sell it early just because you don't feel like being there into the early hours of the morning! I was so angry that Mr. Sheepishly Apologetic Bookstore Manager even offered to reopen the store for me. I refused on principle. (What? He made me mad and I just wanted him to know it. Though, honestly, if I was really feeling vindictive, I should have made him re-openThe summumabeech.)What does this story have to do with anything? Nothing much, except to establish my almost desperate frame of mind... I NEEDED that book. But I knew they'd be available everywhere. That night, there were so many copies of Half-Blood Prince around that I could practically have snagged one off of a passing owl. And just as an aside, I'll tell you that when the 7th book came out a couple years later, that bookstore was open and selling them properly. I take personal credit. Not that I was there... I went to a different store, again on principle. Because I hold grudges like that. ;)Anyway, with my new acquisition, I raced home, told my boyfriend he had to go out with his friends so that he didn't disturb me, and I devoured the book in hours. And it was like... a cool drink of water after you've been thirsty for a long time. I HAD A NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK! But after finishing, I was like, \"Eh, it's just a filler, bridge to the last book, book.\" I wasn't disappointed - don't get me wrong. I had loved it. But I am admitting that it took me a couple reads to really, REALLY appreciate it properly. All the things that we learn, all the ways that this book brings all the things that we'd seen in the first 5 books together, how Harry finally realizes what it all means and what he'll have to do, how he can't just hope to keep defending himself and those he loves, but knows he'll need to go on the offensive if he hopes to win... It was all amazing, brilliantly woven together into this awesome next-to-last book. When Harry tells Ron and Hermione about the real prophecy, and he is grateful to them for not shrinking away from him as though he'd suddenly turned leprous, it hits home just how alone Harry truly is. I never expected them to do differently... but Harry feared they might. It shows how much of a complex Harry has about his role in everything - he's always been alone, separate, so it surprises him that his friends would stick by him. And even at the very end, he is again surprised when they refuse to let him shrug them off and take the Horcrux Hunt onto his own shoulders completely. Harry. Harry... You have better friends than you can possibly know. What I wouldn't give for friends that would stand with me like that, time after time after time, and in the face of such danger and fear. Silly boy. I also love Snape in this book. He's as much of a jerk as always, but in the chapter where he's running from Hogwarts, when he screams at Harry not to call him a coward, how his voice is described, how he's STILL trying to teach Harry, but Harry is too full of blind rage to hear, to think, to learn... It's... brilliant. Harry reaches his conclusions and refuses to see any other alternative, despite what Dumbledore has exemplified year after year - openmindedness, trust, understanding. Damn, I love this book. Just amazing. So I did not cry when I read this recently. I love this book. This book in the series is about maturing. It's about going from silly crushes to real love. It's about dealing with death and loss instead of hiding from it. In this book you get to see Voldermort's past. One question is Tom Riddle sounded HOT. High, hollowed cheekbones and dark hair? WHY THE HELL did he make himself look like THAT?! Super powerful and you're going to make yourself look bald and have no nose? I mean having read slittSo I did not cry when I read this recently.

Why don't you don't you snap a broomstick across your knee and stab me in the heart with it? I'm sure it'll be much less painful. THIS WAS SO SAD. Toooooooooooooooooooooo many deaths in this series.

It's true! Yes, this might've been influenced by the fact that I heard so much bad stuff about him, but I never outright heard that he was an actual fully-fledged Death Eater. (Which, by the way, makes about 0 sense in my opinion. \"Death Eater?\" Like, you consume death? You obtain energy from death? That last one might be it, but still. Very strange moniker.) Anyway, yeah, back to Snape. Even though in book 5, when Harry started taking the Occlumency lessons with Snape, we all - and again I just mean I - hoped that Snape would bond with Harry???? Because he was supposedly on the good side???? And that would be super cute to be honest???? But deep down, or at least once Snape didn't forgive Harry for finding that memory, we concluded he was evil through and through. You can probably tell that I was super annoyed that no one believed Harry when he suspected Snape and Draco of being Death Eaters, even though it was super obvious. I feel like in this book, the doubt everyone had of Harry's ideas was less realistic because they were pretty accurate, but that's just my opinion. (Throwback to my Book 2 review when I said I liked Snape and Draco, hah! How naive I was back then, a few weeks ago.)I liked the idea of the Horocruxes, and I feel like, had that theory been introduced earlier on, the entire series could have been centered around them. I guess in a way, it was. But it is an interesting concept and it adds a lot more of the expected mystery aspect of the Harry Potter Books. As a big romance-lover, the last 5 books were okay, but I wasn't as fulfilled as would've been had there been more romance/drama. (That's actually kind of a lie because they were just as if not more engaging than the stuff I usually read - but that's a given. I just needed a good intro.) Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book fractionally better because of the romance and drama added. Ron and Hermione and all their drama was super funny and cute. And Harry and Ginny I've been rooting for since Book 1, too (never mind that I had outside influence on that as well). Hope to see Harry and Ginny back together by the end of the series.Back to what I said at the beginning, I am pretty pissed that JK Rowling killed off Dumbledore, yet another of my favorite characters. It seems that I just seen someone my favorite and she makes it a priority to kill them - even though these books were published like ten years ago. First Sirius, now Dumbledore, who's next - Hagrid? WAIT, forget I said that. (Ew that was so cheesy and forced.) Dear JK, please don't kill anyone else I love, thanks! I'm pretty apprehensive of the next book, as can be expected, but I've actually heard that there's going to be an eighth book. Who it's about I have yet to know since I haven't finished the seventh, but I'm pretty excited anyway.I KNEWWWWWWWWWWWWWW IT! (view spoiler)[ What the heck is going on with you, Snape?!

I wanted to like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Really, I did. After the huge disappointment of The Order of the Phoenix, I was ready to have fun again. But the same problems that plagued the fifth book are here in the sixth; this novel is more of a chore to get through than anything else, and long passages go by in which absolutely no action takes place. In fact, the whole book is inactivity; the plot consists of - get this - Harry learning about Voldemort's past. This is nothing thatI wanted to like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Really, I did. After the huge disappointment of The Order of the Phoenix, I was ready to have fun again. But the same problems that plagued the fifth book are here in the sixth; this novel is more of a chore to get through than anything else, and long passages go by in which absolutely no action takes place. In fact, the whole book is inactivity; the plot consists of - get this - Harry learning about Voldemort's past. This is nothing that couldn't have been treated in other books with several asides, or even with Voldemort's own book. But no, Rowling felt that this needed to be spread incredibly thin over hundreds and hundreds of pages. She's still not a very good writer, and she badly needs a good editor. There's no reason for one, though; at this point, Rowling could sell the phone book under the title Harry Potter and the Unlisted Number and it would probably sell millions. As for The Half-Blood Prince, 300 pages could easily be removed from its text without anybody - the author included - noticing.Incluso sabiendo el final, se me ha hecho un mundo leer los \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos.  \"...ya hab\u00eda aprendido que muchas veces el humo y las explosiones no eran se\u00f1al de experiencia, sino de ineptitud.\" WARNING: SPOILER ALERT!!! The Half-Blood Prince was easily the best book in the series up to this point. It kept me riveted. This book is right up there among the best fantasy I've ever read. Rowling has finally earned a place in my mind among the best fantasy writers. I know, I came to that realization kind-of late, but this was the first book of hers that really blew me away.

The Half-Blood Prince was easily the best book in the series up to this point. It kept me riveted. This book is right up there among the best fantasy I've ever read. Rowling has finally earned a place in my mind among the best fantasy writers. I know, I came to that realization kind-of late, but this was the first book of hers that really blew me away. It was fascinating to see the scope of the story expand and long-time mysteries be illuminated. In any great fictional story, the scope of the story expands as the story arc progresses. That was definitely the case with this book. The scope of the story expanded, and your knowledge of what's going on greatly increased. Everything that happened up to this point is seen in a larger context. Now that the Ministry is convinced that Voldemort is back, the real war against Voldemort has begun. People are dying every day. Has Snape betrayed the Order of the Phoenix? The book gets off to a suspenseful start. Then Dumbledore decides to give Harry private lessons, and each lesson is fascinating as they use the pensieve to explore memories of different people to try to figure out Voldemort's origins, motives, and plans. Dumbledore gives Harry an assignment to collect a memory from Professor Slughorn, one of the new teachers on the staff, that holds the key to understanding Voldemort's plans. Harry obtains the memory, and from that point forward I could not put the book down. Each chapter from that point on was riveting. Each one contained incredible, amazing events that expanded the scope of the story arc and expanded your understanding of what was happening. The chapter on on 'horcruxes' in particular blew me away. Finally we know how Voldemort achieved immortality! Now it was clear what had to be done to defeat him! It changed everything. That chapter defined the course of the rest of the series. Later, Dumbledore took Harry on a mission to destroy one of the horcruxes, and the account of that excursion was brilliant. I was totally riveted. It was so descriptive, so suspenseful. Upon their return to Hogwarts, they discovered that the school had been infiltrated by Death Eaters, and a full-blown battle erupted. Again, it was so suspenseful, I could not put the book down. Somehow I knew that Dumbledore had to die. Harry had been under Dumbledore's tutelage and protection throughout the whole series. I could see why Dumbledore dying was necessary for Potter's further growth and development. It sets things up so that Potter will have to face Voldemort one last time in the last book, alone. It had to be that way. One thing worries me though. Is Harry ready? After all, he hasn't completed his education and training. Harry was no match for Snape in their duel at the end of Half-Blood Prince. He still has a lot to learn. How can he ever track down and destroy 4 horcruxes, and then destroy Voldemort, all by himself? This is by-far the largest task he's ever had to face, and seems too much for him. Well, we'll just have to see, shall we?P.S.: Am I the only one that has a reasonable guess as to who R.A.B. stands for? Without having read Deathly Hollows yet or knowing anything about how things actually turn out, I think I have it figured out. Think about it: Who in the entire series do we know with a last name that begins with a B? Well of course, there's the Black family. Now there are lots of Blacks, but who among the Blacks has a first name beginning with an R, who opposed Voldemort? Of course! Sirius's brother Regulus! Who else could it possibly be? Regulus stole the horcrux, and soon after Voldemort killed him. It all makes sense. Why hasn't anybody else figured it out? Remember, this is just a theory. I haven't read Deathly Hallows and I know nothing about how things actually turn out. I'll have to read on and see if I'm right.Scrivere la recensione del mio libro preferito della serie di Harry Potter \u00e8 difficile, poich\u00e9 sarebbe facile ridurre il tutto al fatto che mi \u00e8 piaciuto in assoluto, che \u00e8 semplicemente bellissimo e che non c'\u00e8 altro da dire.

Prover\u00f2, dunque, ad articolare maggiormente i motivi che mi hanno portato ad apprezzare cos\u00ec tanto questo titolo, sia all'interno della serie che come opera singola.Innanzitutto, la linea narrativa \u00e8 molto interessante e l'alternarsi di una quotidianit\u00e0 cupa e fatta di normali problematiche adolescenziali (la scuola, le prime cotte e gli amori non corrisposti, le relazioni con compagni e professori, la popolarit\u00e0, tutto filtrato dalla lente della situazione difficoltosa che si vive a livello generale) e dei flashback, delle porzioni di storia dedicate alla narrazione del passato di Voldemort, sempre curioso ed interessante, che si mescola sapientemente con il resto della storia ed aggiunge uno spessore consistente alla trama. I personaggi crescono notevolmente durante tutto l'arco narrativo, complici sia i grandi eventi drammatici che hanno vissuto precedentemente e che ancora caratterizzano le loro esistenze, ma anche le semplici tappe che qualsiasi adolescente ha affrontato in quello stesso periodo della sua vita. Il rapporto fra i personaggi si fa pi\u00f9 complesso e sfaccettato, impariamo a conoscere maggiormente alcune figure che erano rimaste in ombra ed in generale alunni e professori di Hogwarts acquisiscono ancor pi\u00f9 tridimensionalit\u00e0 e spessore. Come dicevo, le porzioni di storia dedicate allo studio del passato di Voldemort sono interessantissime, un espediente molto intelligente per andare a conoscere un personaggio cos\u00ec importante ed allo stesso tempo impostare quelle che saranno importanti rivelazioni per il proseguimento delle vicende. Il rapporto fra Harry Potter e Silente, poi, viene sapientemente tratteggiato durante queste lezioni, aggiungendo un ulteriore elemento di coinvolgimento per il lettore, ancor pi\u00f9 coinvolto dal presente e dal passato delle vicende. L'atmosfera \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 matura e cupa rispetto ai capitoli precedenti, si percepisce la tensione, il senso d'ansia e di difficolt\u00e0 del momento, ma rimane comunque presente il senso di casa, di domesticit\u00e0 che si respira ogni volta che si torna ad Hogwarts, circondandosi di personaggi e luoghi conosciuti. Anche lo stile, pur migliorando nettamente, rimane sempre riconoscibile, semplice, scorrevole, ma capace di profondit\u00e0 e complessit\u00e0 quando necessario. Questi sono solamente alcuni punti che mi vengono in mente nell'analisi di quest'opera, ma gli elementi che la rendono ricca e godibile sono anche altri la crescita del personaggio di Draco Malfoy e la sua relazione con Severus Piton, il rapporto fra Ron ed Hermione, il Lumaclub e tutti i momenti ad esso correlati, la storia del Principe Mezzosangue, giusto per fare qualche esempio. Un'opera ben scritta, dunque, che approfondisce tutte le tematiche classiche della serie, aggiungendo innumerevoli elementi d'interesse e maggiore complessit\u00e0, un sesto libro che si inserisce perfettamente nel contesto della saga ed allo stesso tempo prepara l'atmosfera per il gran finale. C'\u00e8 tutto ci\u00f2 che si pu\u00f2 cercare in un libro fantasy per ragazzi, dal divertimento alla tensione, dai colpi di scena alle rivelazioni pi\u00f9 sconvolgenti, sempre con il giusto tocco di magia, leggerezza, atmosfera tipica e riconoscibile che ha reso questi libri universalmente amati ed apprezzati.

Then comes that action sequence towards the end and it had my heart pounding and my tears spilling like no one's business.Oh well! Now is time to sleep and savor the Harry Potter books while they last. I also think I'm taking a break before reading the last one. I'm not ready to leave the wizarding world just yet, so I'll make it last as long as possible.[First read: 16th July, 2005. 2 stars.

We are seeing the plot coming together much more and, of course, we have the ultimate plot device that will take us right to the end now. However, it still felt... just a bit meh.Harry and Ron have still not changed (excepting the hormones) and I find that rather annoying. They've been the same kind of stupid-brave, semi-intelligent boys throughout and it seems only external things have changed with them. Whilst Hermione has altered pretty much every book, in this one I found her quite irritating, though I can't quite put my finger on why. There seemed a small shift just in the way she was and spoke. Perhaps that was hormones, too. Whilst we did get a lot more of Dumbledore here (which I think was long overdue) he didn't seem as well-developed as he could have been. The other characters were, again, purely background and just there to fill an otherwise empty space.It was faster paced than the previous books have been, yet the smallness of the world kind of means that everything takes place right here and right now, which contributes to propelling the story forward more than the writing did. I thought it carried well from the previous book better than the others did (it always felt like an abrupt ending preceded an abrupt beginning) and I think that is a reflection of the way the plot has surpassed the idea of them being individual books and instead a whole, full series.Usually I am not bothered about spoilers, and since I've read these before, seen the film and looked at a thousand Tumblr posts about them, there's no getting away from knowing what happens. However, when I do read with a previous knowledge to a book, I always find that the writing still holds a surprise for me: not in this case. I didn't see any surprises anywhere at all and that was very disappointing.For me, this wasn't as good as The Order of the Phoenix. Harry's actions are a little less forgivable/understandable here, though it's still obvious the poor kid is suffering from some form of PTSD, as well as grieving over the death of his godfather, but it's hard to ignore just how much of this book he spends trying to connect Draco to everything wrong going on around him. (I mean, it's kinda obvious Harry is totally crushing on Malfoy, but whatevs)However, I don't really think this book is abFor me, this wasn't as good as The Order of the Phoenix.

(I mean, it's kinda obvious Harry is totally crushing on Malfoy, but whatevs)However, I don't really think this book is about Harry. Of course he's the main character, but I really think this book is about Dumbledore and Voldemort. In Phoenix, it became clear that Dumbledore is not a wholesomely good man. His biggest fault probably being his willingness to forget that Harry is just a child and throwing him into his role as a chosen hero. And it's explored more here. The situation is less dangerous, but the stakes are just as high. Dumbledore is totally willing to use Harry to achieve an end. Not that I'm saying Dumbledore isn't a good person, he certainly is. But when I was a child he was the ultimate good, who could do no wrong, and with this book, it becomes more clear that he, like most people, isn't totally and completely good. He protects the ones he loves, but he's willing to use Harry as less of a person, and more as a means to an end. And important end no doubt, but he seems to forget that Harry is just a teenager.And then we get the opportunity to explore Voldemort's past, which I found incredibly interesting. It was intriguing to see the transformation he goes through again, and to see the path he walks that leads him to becoming the Dark Lord we know. And the stuff with Draco is great as well, and with context from the entire series, I find myself really able to sympathize with the poor kid. He just wants to protect his family, and I just feel so bad for him. I wanna give him a hug and tell him everything's gonna be okay.Really, this just gets me more excited to reread The Deathly Hallows, though I'm not sure I'm prepared for the body count that book will leave behind. I need to reread it soon so I can reread the entire series again in December.4.5\u201cIt is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\u201d The narration starts with a wizarding world fully aware now that the Dark Lord is once more \u2018alive\u2019 and bent on regaining control, with danger and fear permeating everything.

Deaths have always been present in the series but we are now far from the muted treatments of the first books.Dumbledore finally enlists Harry\u2019s help in their fight against Voldemort, and I for one really enjoyed the sections showing us the origin story of Tom Riddle. It made him more human in a way, or rather less of a god-like figure.We still have plenty of humour, thankfully, such as the scene with the Muggle Prime Minister or life at Hogwarts, to give us moments of laughter to break the tension. Additionally, for a novel focusing more and more on the battle against evil, much emphasis is put on feelings, such as filial love, teenage infatuation, real (and false) love, friendship, courage, redemption, etc. Rowling is echoing Dumbledore\u2019s belief in the power of the heart.Theories on the structure of the series abound but I do like the one that proposes that all 7 books can be folded at book 4, making Prisoner of Azkaban joined with Order of the Phoenix, and indeed Chamber of Secrets with the Half-Blood Prince. There are many parallels, such as Tom Riddle\u2019s diary and the Potions coursebook, Ginny, Parseltongue, etc. And more can indeed be seen in book 1 and 7.There is also a kind of expectant feeling cursing through the whole novel, just under the surface - a preparation for the real events, as indeed it is. This is the only book in the series that does not have a real ending, but sets up the Quest for the final instalment. Usually this would weaken the story but that is not the case in this instance. On the contrary, it resonates strongly, even more so in this re-reading.Well, I actually don\u2019t have many things to say about this book. What I can say is this book makes me so eager to read the next book. I have noticed that the ending got sadder with every book in this series but this is the ultimate sad ending.

Things were fundamentally changed in this book. As for Harry, I kind of miss the younger Harry. I think he had became more arrogant than when he first came in the magical world. He\u2019s not too grumpy like I think he was in the previous book, but I don\u2019t really like something about him in this book. I especially despise his suspicious of Snape and Malfoy. He seemed so determined to think Snape and Malfoy were bad even though all evidence said otherwise. His suspicion was only based on dislike and I have to say (Harry Potter fans please don\u2019t hate me) that it was pretty low. But Harry also showed his best quality here too. His love and selflessness toward his friends is wonderful. But I think he ought to listen to Hermione more. It\u2019s been six book for his six years in Hogwarts and Hermione was usually right about almost everything in every year.

There wasn't as much action in this book as there was in previous books (until the very end) BUT J.K Rowling definitely made up for that with the character development which was needed, especially for characters we knew little about, like Voldemort. Harry is no longer spending his time feeling down but moving on from his previous year at Hogwarts, growing up and dealing with his situation that little bit more in an adult way. He's feeling much better in himself, more accepted by his friends/teachers. But the rage and fear still continues in Harry throughout this book, determined to get through this wreck. Voldemort's history was written in so so SO well, using the pensive for this was genius. Here we saw how Tom Riddle came to become Lord Voldemort. His character development was greatly needed. I thoroughly enjoyed Dumbledore's lessons. This book also has my most favorite chapter in the series so far. 'The cave' chapter was so different and refreshing, Harry and Dumbledore having an adventure together? And outside Hogwarts grounds too? It was awesome! The events of this chapter was described so well. Dumbledore drinking the potion and going through alllll that pain was heartbreaking, also the Inferi were absolutely terrifying!!!Okay, so. It is really hard for me to talk about this book without dropping spoilers. Half Blood Prince was full of shocks!! So SPOILER ALERT!!! I have to mention Dumbledore's death. Even though I knew this was going to happen, and I saw the movies it still saddened me! Dumbledore was so great in this book, he made loads of appearances which really makes a difference to The Order Of The Phoenix where we had little to no scenes with him. The funeral was just so depressing. UGHHH! :(I was a tiny bit sceptical about Harry and Ginnys relationship at first but I really do enjoy them together, the same as Ron and Hermione (although not officially together) they are just adorable, all the jealousy was both cute and hilarious to read! I can't wait to read on and watch all the characters relationships flourish.Now something I was really shocked by. I found myself feeling so sorry for Draco. He was raised to believe he was superior to everyone else from a young age so he doesn't really know much better i guess. He hasn't really had the chance to think for himself to become either good or bad because of his parents/voldemort expected so much. I believe he was driven to be the way he is now by fear his whole life. Sirius wasn't a coward so he was able to stand up to what he believed in with his family being the way they were, whereas I feel like Draco is too much of a coward break free from it all. I still think that he's an evil piece of work but I can't help but feeling some sympathy. Also I really don't think he would have killed Dumbledore.Overall, I loved The Half-Blood Prince so surprise surprise I give it a 5/5 :) :) In the summer of 2003, the Arizona Diamondbacks went on a crazy intense winning streak, due mostly to the fact that they had something like eleven to thirteen rookies playing at any given time, all of whom were unknown quantities (and thus harder to beat). They were calling them the u0026quot;Baby Backsu0026quot; (future Cy Young winner Brandon Webb among them).

They were calling them the \"Baby Backs\" (future Cy Young winner Brandon Webb among them). As of June 30, 2003, the team had won eleven consecutive games, one away from beating their record. My sister, Melissa, likes baseball in an unnatural obsessive fashion (much the way I like TV) and got us tickets to the game. Naturally this concerned me due to the midnight release part of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which I was supposed to be attending that night. (Bear with me, this story does eventually relate to Half-Blood Prince.)So it's like the bottom of the 8th inning and we're losing and I'm really worried at this point that we're going to be late so I make my entire family get up and leave. My sister put up a little bit of a fight, but as we were losing by at least three runs, she eventually shut up and we left. But as we were walking back to the car, the stadium EXPLODED. And kept exploding. Fireworks went off (not a euphemism). And my sister turned to me and knifed my bowels into ribbons with just the power of her angry eyes. I tried to explain to her that you don't fuck around with Harry Potter, but not five minutes later when we'd reached the car and turned on the radio and she learned that we'd won that 12th consecutive game and that we'd been there and left, I really thought she might murder me. She hadn't read Harry Potter yet, you see. She didn't understand.Fast forward two years. She was right there with me at the midnight release of Half-Blood Prince, dressed as Draco Malfoy. We raced home together and read the book late into the night, waking up early to finish. I finished first and she was mad when I started crying and she had to wait to find out why. And of course, later in the shower, when I remembered what happened and started crying AGAIN (is there anything more pathetic than crying in the shower over a dead fictional character?), after I got out she couldn't resist making fun of me. Apparently I'd been crying so loud that she'd heard the sobs through the walls and over the sound of the running water. But FUCK, man! That shit is sad! Served her right ten minutes later when it was her turn to cry.But anyway, the point is that none of you should be in doubt: Harry Potter is way more important than baseball. And football. And soccer. And Hockey. And that is a lesson everybody should learn.In which Draco Malfoy has better priorities (gives up on quidditch and prefect activities whereas Harry spends half the book agonizing over sports and house points as if they matter) and more of an independent intellect (he learned occulmency over the summer to protect his privacy re: his ally Snape whereas Harry wouldn't even to protect himself from Voldemort u0026amp;amp; in general, continues to show a complete disinterest in learning magic) than Harry Potter, the world learns that JKR has some veryIn which Draco Malfoy has better priorities (gives up on quidditch and prefect activities whereas Harry spends half the book agonizing over sports and house points as if they matter) and more of an independent intellect (he learned occulmency over the summer to protect his privacy re: his ally Snape whereas Harry wouldn't even to protect himself from Voldemort u0026amp; in general, continues to show a complete disinterest in learning magic) than Harry Potter, the world learns that JKR has some very odd ideas about romance (Tonks, Hermione and Merope all losing their minds and personalities over lost love and it being framed as such, not to mention the dread Ginny-sue) and Tom Riddle, a really potentially interesting character who was set up as a counter to Harry, becomes an abnormal psychology 101 case study in sociopathy.Torn between one and two stars, really.

As a reader, this book was the most gripping out of all of them. Within the first chapter or two, I was already ready to start throwing punches left and right. And that amount of emotion was there throughout the entire book--especially the ending. Now, I know that these are works of fiction, but for Harry Potter fanatics, the death of someone who has become very real to us and who is a favorite character of many, the ending was as painful as can be. I definitely have to give props to Rowling for her control over her readers' emotions in this book. We've reached very frightening times in Harry's world...I can only imagine what the next book is going to bring...*RE-READ*The emotions I get from this book will feel new to me every time I read it.

It is so fucking heartbreaking every single time. It is the biggest game-changer out of all the books. The only wizard Voldemort ever feared was murdered by his own friend. Snape and Dumbledore are two of my all time favorite characters, so that scene just blows my mind.Learning about Voldemort through Dumbledore and Slughorn's memories was amazing. I just love this book so fucking much. It is so emotional, game-changing, and absolutely genius.Awesome as ever - deeuuhhhhh.But I forgot how sad the ending was *cries silently* oh! and that moment Harry had with Ginny in the end was so. freaking. good!Plot gets better and better which book and despite the fact this is reread #18668787, I still don't get bored with it. Awesome. Just awesome. If you haven't read the HP series yet... PLLEEEAAAASSSEEE DO!!!! *I listened to the audiobook by the way\"Silente avr\u00e0 veramente lasciato la scuola solo quando non ci sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 nessuno che gli sia fedele.\"Che male al cuore. Questo libro \u00e8 indescrivibile.\"Andr\u00e0 tutto bene, signore\" ripet\u00e8 ancora e ancora, pi\u00f9 preoccupato del mutismo di Silente di quanto lo fosse stato dalla sua voce indebolita. \"Ci siamo quasi... Posso farci materializzare tutti e due... non si preoccupi.\"\"Non sono preoccupato, Harry\" rispose Silente, la voce un po' pi\u00f9 forte nonostante l'acqua gelata. \"Sono con te\".Updated re-read 11/01/16 - I've just finished the Stephen Fry audiobook and it was excellent. The last few chapters of this book always make me quite miserable, no matter how many times I read it, I still cry. ----------------------------------------------------This was so bloody sad. I don't know why I keep reading this, it always ends in tears. It's still one of my favourites.As always a great part of the series, better than book five at least. I look forward to finishing the series next month.I'm so sad, but this book was so great. So far, my favourite book in the series.Review up sometime... if I can get out of bed D:4.5Este libro me gust\u00f3 much\u00edsimo m\u00e1s que el anterior, a ver ahora cuando leo el \u00faltimo.

THIS BOOK CONTINUES TO BE EXTREMELY UPSETTINGOH MY CLARK GABLE I CANNOT EVEN RIGHT NOW, NO ONE TALK TO ME.These books continue to get better and better as they go along. It might surprise some reading this that I was tempted to give this book five stars for pure enjoyment, but objectively I do not believe it was quite as good as many other five star novels.

It might surprise some reading this that I was tempted to give this book five stars for pure enjoyment, but objectively I do not believe it was quite as good as many other five star novels. The story in this novel should be familiar to anyone with any knowledge of popular culture (that of Harry Potter, the boy wizard who must fight and defeat the dark lord Voldemort). Indeed, there has been an entire subculture of pop culture (akin to other franchises like Marvel, DC, Game of Thrones, Doctor Who etc) which has developed alongside these books, and initially made me very skeptical of the series. I was particularly skeptical with the first three books (the third book improved on the first two admittedly) with the poorly defined magic systems, the childish characters, the writing that was still quite rough-around-the-edges and actually only was attracted to the worldbuilding and the overall charm of the novels. However, as Rowling has continued to write her quality of plotting, character-development and worldbuilding has also improved. In short her novels have transformed into typical children's fiction and become something more worthwhile.Let me explain why these books become more worthwhile. For instance, the first few novels were so singularly focused on the schooling at Hogwarts that any reference to the overall villains seemed like some cheap side-story. However, this novel (and the previous two) adopt more mature tones and a clearer focus on where the entire story is headed. The novels also reveal heightened levels of political subtext and references to how education systems and government systems are run (forming a kind of fascinating analysis of real life despite featuring a magical world - something more fantasy books should undertake). Character building further improves. These books are perhaps, the most famous coming-of-age stories in the world at the moment, and they are with the overall character development, prime examples of this. Harry, though involved in helping the adult world, must deal with the pressures of being treated like a child - albeit a special child - and these later novels expose these pressures with writing full of emotion, charm and greater wit. It's somewhat manipulative of Rowling, but her novels are written in a way that the expected audience can grow alongside the characters and find that they themselves can identify strongly with what the characters feel. Children and teenagers certainly understand what it is to feel special, powerless, weak, inadequate, intelligent and awkward. These are emotions that Rowling exposes and uses in useful ways as a writer.Admittedly, as fantasy books these are far from the greatest examples. They are nice children's novels - although I place far greater importance on The Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, The Hobbit and gems like Little House in the Woods or Little Women. And this importance is only because those were novels which defined part of my childhood reading experience (add in some Roald Dahl or other classics of course). I almost forgot to mention the prose itself. It's a nice, charming style which Rowling has fine-tuned by the time of this book: casual enough, simple, but with nuance and sophistication hidden in the word-choices it's certainly a very sympathetic type of writing and one suitable for her audience. I would state that the best and most recognizable technique of Rowling's is her use of foreshadowing and asides together. Some of her foreshadowing is very neat and clever and though some of it in the earlier books is very obvious, by the stage of this book it is reached a stage where it becomes more intriguing rather than apparent.As for the plot of this book, well it focuses on the terror that the return of Voldemort has brought to the wizarding world and the discovery of an important textbook owned by a mysterious Half-Blood Prince (a textbook which provides all kinds of secret tips for Harry in his potions class). The interesting Snape and the fatherly Dumbledore have greater roles again in this novel and the resolution leads to something of a cliff-hanger (but not quite). In short it's an interesting novel where the 'devil is in the details' as they say.To me I think that a lot of the reputation of these novels is undeserved. They are nice books and certainly enjoyable (much like Hunger Games or Divergent is to me) and I appreciate that they lead a lot of children into the greater world of reading. I also feel that the whole 'evil books' side of the reputation (with some parents not allowing their children to read them) is also undeserved. There are some great themes and lessons in here - although I dislike the harsh punishments handed out by teachers and the casual use of hexes and curses in the books at times. The biggest draw is, of course, the wizarding world and the idea of having a school for wizards which I don't think is something seen in western literature in this way. Either way, I certainly am enjoying reading these books like I enjoy the other books. They're mostly unique, charming and get better as they continue. 4 stars. Second read. Spoilers EVERYWHERE.Unlike the other mega-large Harry Potter books (aka 4, 5, and 7), I ended up liking Half-Blood Prince a little less the second time around. The full-steam-ahead feeling that characterized Books 4 and 5 seemed to lose a little bit of momentum here. If Order of the Phoenix is the book where things get real in the Harry Potter world, then Half-Blood Prince is a quieter book, the moment when Rowling is really planning for the ending, building the story and b4 stars. Second read. Spoilers EVERYWHERE.Unlike the other mega-large Harry Potter books (aka 4, 5, and 7), I ended up liking Half-Blood Prince a little less the second time around. The full-steam-ahead feeling that characterized Books 4 and 5 seemed to lose a little bit of momentum here. If Order of the Phoenix is the book where things get real in the Harry Potter world, then Half-Blood Prince is a quieter book, the moment when Rowling is really planning for the ending, building the story and background for the last part of the story and the inevitable battle between Voldemort and Harry. On my first read of Half-Blood Prince, I was enthralled by the backstory. Finally, after years, we were getting to the \"heart\" of Voldemort and how he became the way he is. Only by understanding him could Harry beat him. On my second read, though, I felt like the book dragged a bit - Voldemort doesn't even really play a role in the battle at the end - and even though the actions that happen in this book are necessary to get us to book 7, it really didn't feel like a big payoff in the end. I was desperate to get to certain moments in the book the second time around - I wanted Harry to get the damn memory from Slughorn immediately, I wanted to get to the moment where Harry and Dumbledore discuss choices, I wanted to see the cave again, and even though it hurt, I wanted to re-read that moment when Snape kills Dumbledore. Because there were so many important bits of backstory, and a lot of them occur at the end of the book, my second read was characterized by a bit more impatience, especially with the Malfoy subplot, which I found to be a bit of a retread of book 5, in that Harry believes something that no one else does.What IS interesting is how much more pronounced that obsession with catching Malfoy was to me on this second read. I feel like that obsession is a bit of a foreshadowing for Harry's obsession with the Deathly Hallows in book seven, and also shows Harry's stubborn belief in his own ideas without basis and the way he rushes into action (also characterized by his disastrous attempts at Occlumency and his constant dreams about the Department of Mysteries in book 5). While it's good to stand up for your beliefs, I think the stubbornness makes Harry reckless, a lot like Sirius, and it makes Harry's choices of Hallows vs. Horcruxes that much smarter in book 7. Harry continues to be a very angsty teenager - with good reason, but nevertheless, there's a lot of anger and resentment at his predicament. This was the first time in reading where I felt like I wouldn't necessarily want to be Harry's friend - he's a bit scary in his anger. That said, I still very much enjoyed seeing the advanced magic in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's NEWT classes, the Quidditch games, and yes, the romance. Half-Blood Prince is definitely the book of teenage hormones, where Ron finally realizes that girls exist, and thus spends quite a lot of time making out with Lavender Brown before realizing that he might actually like someone else a bit more. Meanwhile, Harry's realization that Ginny exists as a girl and not just his best friend's sister was so satisfying, even the second time around. Because Ginny is my favourite character, I was grateful that we got so much more of her in this book, and got to see how, unlike Harry's \"relationship\" with Cho, which was really based on her looks, Harry and Ginny already had a rapport, they've known each other for a long time, and his feelings grew naturally out of his gradual knowledge of her as a smart, funny, talented, and headstrong girl who isn't afraid to fight back. Even the scenes when they're together are so different from Harry's date with Cho, where he was stuck in Madam Puddifoot's - right after Harry and Ginny get together, they're sitting casually in the Gryffindor common room laughing with Ron and Hermione. It's clear that this is a relationship that is real. It's not a perfect read, but nevertheless, the second time around, the scenes at the end of the book with Harry and Dumbledore still made me cry. I knew the first time around that Dumbledore would have to die - there's a reason why that cliche about the old mentor dying before the hero can move on exists - but even knowing all that did not stop me from feeling the poignancy of the funeral, of Harry and Ginny's break-up, and the moment when Hermione and Ron step up and insist on going with Harry on his mission. Half-Blood Prince makes me cry bit, fat, hot tears for like three entire chapters; it grabs me emotionally and wrings me with so much hurt (an ominous sign for Deathly Hallows, which I avoid reading/watching because of the emotional wreckage). It's painful and beautiful and tragic.I was never a fan of the romance angle of HBP, and the Penseive Dance, while really interesting, is basically the main plot and drama of the story, which kind of falls flat in comparison to the Triwizard Tournament andHalf-Blood Prince makes me cry bit, fat, hot tears for like three entire chapters; it grabs me emotionally and wrings me with so much hurt (an ominous sign for Deathly Hallows, which I avoid reading/watching because of the emotional wreckage). It's painful and beautiful and tragic.I was never a fan of the romance angle of HBP, and the Penseive Dance, while really interesting, is basically the main plot and drama of the story, which kind of falls flat in comparison to the Triwizard Tournament and the growing darkness and hostility of Order of the Phoenix. While the adventure with Dumbledore at the end is exciting and intriguing, and the Battle is terrifying and heart-pounding, I don't think it lives up to the previous books. Not that it isn't interesting, and the end isn't heartbreaking, but overall, the plot falls a little flat for me. Mind you, my eyes are still red and puffy from all the crying.Let it be said, however, and despite my personal feelings about the pairing, book Ginny Weasley is so much better than movie Ginny. She has spunk and is a nice counter to Hermione's intellect and brains-first attitude. Ginny is popular and pretty and dates around, and doesn't let her brothers give her crap for it! And there's something to be said of that. She holds her own with Harry and his friends, and with Fred and George, when she needs to, and that's so much cooler than the movie Ginny who has no personality.That being said, I'm not a Harry-Ginny fan. To me, it feels rushed (look at the Ron-Hermione, 7 book long setup!), and Ginny seems to be too much of a replacement for his mother. He doesn't notice her for years, and then all of a sudden his \"monster\" is upset she's kissing Dean? I just don't buy it. I also feel like Harry needs someone outside the realm of his group of friends, if anyone at all. Why does Harry need a girlfriend? He will never be happy at home, and while I get that part of the Ginny relationship works because she's okay with him off battling battles, because that's what he does, it just never felt right to me.HBP also has the ultimate betrayal (or does it!?) and I remember being SO. ANGRY. and confused. WHY!?One of my least favorites of the series, but it still has some really great moments (Felix Felicis!) and is, ultimately, still Harry Potter.I'm starting Deathly Hallows with a box of tissues next to me. I just finished reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and I literally loved it! So far, my favorite novel from the Harry Potter series was Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban but now, it is on an equal footing with this one. I love how this novel was about Harry and Dumbledore's relationship. I have always admired Dumbledore and this was a good think to dedicate one book to his character. As I said in my updates, I love his stories and how he shared them with Harry and with us. ObvI just finished reading Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and I literally loved it!

Obviously, I am so sad about the end of this novel, but Dumbledore will always be in our hearts.I also liked the fact that there were lots of actions in this novel. It was much more interesting to read than when there are only describing passages and no actions to bring the story forward. When books are so long, I really need to be involved in the story, like I was in the research of the horcruxes.To conclude, I definitely had to give a 5 stars to this novel because I really loved it!\"E' L'IGNOTO CHE TEMIAMO QUANDO GUARDIAMO LA MORTE E IL BUIO...NIENT'ALTRO...\"\"SILENTE AVR\u00e0 VERAMENTE LASCIATO LA SCUOLA SOLO QUANDO NESSUNO GLI SAR\u00e0 PI\u00f9 FEDELE\"L'ho finito stanotte  stamattina alle 3.14. non sono riuscita a staccarmi.l'ho centellinato perch\u00e8 volevo gustarmelo e l'ho alternato ad altre letture, ma Harry \u00e8 Harry.

I still want to cry, ugh. This is probably my favorite book from Harry Potter so far. It is the more romantic and I liked that a lot. I totally ship Ron and Hermione.

Also a lot different from the movies, because there I didn't even understand what was happening (I wasn't even sure she was Tonks, oh God).But of course, Dumbledore... I already knew he was going to die, but I'm still very sad. This book is where he is more important, he appears a lot, and then... bum! IT'S SO NOT FAIR. DUMBLEDORE WAS AN AWESOME CHARACTER, HE WAS SO KIND AND INTELLIGENT AND... I DON'T KNOW, BUT THIS DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. HARRY POTTER DOESN'T MAKE SENSE WITHOUT HIM. IT JUST DOESN'T. I'M SO SAD AND PISSED OFF RIGHT NOW. WHY???Anyway... I loved this book, but I could still kill it. I love it and I hate it. It's a complicated relationship.4.5 stars. While the quality of the Harry Potter books are, without a doubt, consistently brilliant; This book is definitely not my favourite in the series. I think this is mostly due to the bunch of annoying characters that suddenly spring up in this book. Cormac McLaggen, Lavender Brown and Horace Slughorn, to name a few, particularly bugged me. But, honestly, Slughorn was by far the worst! I just cannot find any reason to like him as a person and, seeing as he's only introduced into the story4.5 stars.

I love how strong her character became in this book and I thought it was cute to see Harry start to think of her as her own person, and not just 'Ron's sister'. Harry and Ginny! Awh.And of course, Dumbledore's death was bloody heartbreaking. I'm incredibly excited to reach the end of this series soon because I've just enjoyed these books so much.

It's increible to see the work that J. K. Rowling put into her books to make one solid, comprehensive narrative that flows right from book I of the series. Obviously the dramatic ending is a huge talking point of this book, and it sets up the events of The Deathly Hallows well. If you haven't read this, get on it. You won't regret it!I really love this book and for me it comes down to the flashbacks. In every book, in every situation, I am drawn to the history of everything. I like exposition I guess. When Dumbledore and Harry are traveling around memories, learning about Horocruxes, and discovering Tom Riddle's past, I just don't think anything beats that! Honestly, it's my absolute favorite in the series hands down!I don't know why but this has always been one of my least favorite books in the series. Basically this means I love it but only love it, not really love it. I do love the movie though .... Which is weird. Oh well. This isn't really a review as much as rambling so I'm done now.

Gosh loved this sooooo much!I'm not ready for it to end. My heart is broken and it will never heal. Rowling, why u do dis!? :'(No actual plotThe story of the sixth book is very short and simple, consisting mostly of flashbacks rather than actual events taking place in the present. In fact, Harry is more like a passive observer to these events. This book could have easily not be called Harry Potter but rather \u201cVoltemort, the Early Years\u201d since it was mostly about the origin of the villain. A villain I don\u2019t give a shit about since he got defeated by his own powers and didn\u2019t learn from it.Magic nonsenseThe nonsense of thNo actual plotThe story of the sixth book is very short and simple, consisting mostly of flashbacks rather than actual events taking place in the present. In fact, Harry is more like a passive observer to these events. This book could have easily not be called Harry Potter but rather \u201cVoltemort, the Early Years\u201d since it was mostly about the origin of the villain. A villain I don\u2019t give a shit about since he got defeated by his own powers and didn\u2019t learn from it.Magic nonsenseThe nonsense of the magic world continues as we see the wizards using their memories as footage instead of video recordings. We hardly remember things as they happened, so memories are an awful source of information. Unlike video recordings, we twist around the events to remember them as we want them to. Which by the way, is something that happens even in the book, as they are proven to be easily falsified. Our impression of the past has little to no relation with how events actually happened. This system of evidence is bullshit!No defensesOnce again, the magic police failed to capture even one of the hundreds of bad guys that escaped and the only people they arrested were innocent wizards who had nothing to do with evil acts. They were so desperate that they had to seek help by children selling magic pranks. You know, stuff like sneeze dust, hearing ears, and invisibility hats. That\u2019s right, the elite in the ministry of magic never heard of simple trinkets, children create for fun. Five thousand years of magic history and this was the first time they heard of an invisibility hat or enhanced hearing. Didn\u2019t these people ever hear of Du0026amp;D? The core books are full of ideas.And once again the security at the school is paper thin. So what if they are now searching school bags and prevent teleportation? The kids could still smuggle in, anything they like through mail. Why do you go as far as searching bags but not the mail you stupid teachers? Those rascals were sneaking in guns and drugs under your very nose! Why were you even surprised when the school is invaded by evil wizards who teleported through a closet, in an area that does not allow teleportation? So much for magic making sense.Circular logicIn this excuse of a story, Harry is given the task to extract memories from a wizard, concerning info about the Big Bad. Disregard how memories are not trustworthy and can easily be altered. Although he did manage to succeed in that, once again it wasn\u2019t done with wits or strategy. No sir, he just cheated, like always. He drank a luck potion which lets him automatically succeed in anything. That\u2019s right, you don\u2019t need to try hard to succeed, you just need a convenient mcguffin which for some reason didn\u2019t exist so far.But wait, you might think, if Harry got the potion because he was very good at potion brewing, means that he did something right and got rewarded for his talent, instead of staying inactive as always. I should be praising him for doing that. Only thing, he didn\u2019t succeed by trying hard. The one who gave him the potion was the same wizard he was sent to extract memories from. Essentially, the conflict resolved on its own, by using circular logic. Harry wasn\u2019t even needed for fulfilling this mission. ANYONE could have done that as long as he had drunk the potion. There is no way of losing if you drink it.Winners always cheatHe also didn\u2019t get the potion by being good at potion brewing, which would excuse him deserving to drink it and extracting the information. He was cheating the whole time by using a notebook full of potion brewing secrets. And no, he is not excused for using those notes properly and thus deserving to get the potion. He deliberately kept the notes hidden from everybody, and pretended he was a genius at brewing potions. What an asshole! And thus, Rowling is once again advising little children to cheat all the time in school instead of trying hard.Character de-evolutionBut wait, who gave him the notebook? Maybe he got it as reward for something he did right, and thus he at least deserves to get the potion by cheating. Nope, he randomly found it without doing anything to deserve it. And as it turns out, it was a trap set by a traitor who was manipulating him throughout the whole book. You would think Harry would be far more careful after the 10th time a teacher of the dark arts is revealed to be a traitor, and an evil notebook that was brainwashing children in the second year. But no, he still falls for it like a complete newb. He has no free will in this whole story and is just moving from one plot device to another plot device because Rowling has no clue how to keep him consistent with past events. And this is what really gets me with fans of the books. They keep praising them for having characters that develop as years go by, when we clearly see here Harry didn\u2019t change one bit. Where are these changes you are talking about? Are you referring to Dumbledore having a different actor in every movie?Disgusting romanceYou want more plot devises? Good because the luck potion is so overpowered that Harry abused it not only for fulfilling his mission, but also to get laid. And he did it in the most despicable way imaginable. He found a girl he liked and charmed her into falling in love with him. This was not achieved through personal charisma, it was the effect of the potion, meaning he brainwashed her. And what makes this situation even worse is that the girl already had a boyfriend. Harry abused the potion to make them have a fight and break up. Meaning, not only he seduced her, he also destroyed the love of two people. What kind of a message is this Rowling? Is this supposed to be romance? You are advising the children who are reading this shit to consider romance being the same as secretly purring Viagra in drinks, so they can get laid.Deus ex potionAnd I am not even done yet. The luck potion is so broken, that it makes all spells targeting you to boomerang back to the guy who casts them. Which is exactly what Harry and some other kids did at the end of the book so they can defeat super elite evil wizards. Screw decades of training hard in mastering magic; epic level wizards got owned by rookies because they drank the potion of plot armor. And of course only the good guys have access to this plot devise and not the bad guys. Because if they did, they would have killed all the powerful good wizards in the world by standing still and letting the spells they are targeting them, to bounce back at their face. Great use of strategy once more Rowling.Winners don\u2019t need to try anymoreWhich brings us to another question. Why did the wizard give such a powerful potion to Harry just for being good at a school session? With this thing you can capture the gold sphere in Quidditch, get laid, or win the lottery. Hell, why think so small; you take over the world with this potion, and you hand it around to anyone who gets an A at a test. You are also rewarding a student who won, by letting him keep winning at everything thereafter without having to try anymore. What kind of logic is this and how is it fair for the rest of the students?Uninteresting deathAnother major secondary character dies at the end of this book and again I am left completely uninterested about it. They can always use the time machine to undo his death. Oh, that\u2019s right, they destroyed the time machines so Voltemort can\u2019t use them. God forbid if they had used them to prevent him from even becoming powerful in the first place, so none of that shit ever happened. Also, the reason the major character got killed was completely stupid. If he had a couple of \u201cwin at everything\u201d potions with him, something he could have easily done since he is a freaking archwizard, this would never have happened. Do you see what happens when you abuse magic to the point nothing matters anymore? And why did he even take Harry with him? He was completely useless the whole time.Demystified fameAnd hold on a freaking second. Spells that bounce back to their caster? What does that reminds me of? Oh that\u2019s right; the way Voltemort was originally defeated. Rowling, are you honestly telling me that there was such a thing all along and people made a legendary hero out of Harry as a baby for something anyone could have done by simply drinking this potion? So what was the point of Voltemort wasting four books in trying to undo the plot armor shield Harry had by his dead mommy when Harry can just drink the potion and get it back? And do you know what else that means? Harry\u2019s fame makes no sense by making the super amazing spell only his parents knew of and nobody else could possibly comprehend or copy, to now be just a side effect of a potion everybody knows about and uses all the time. So what the hell does that mean, everybody who drinks the potion is a legendary hero? Holy shit Rowling, you just power creeped the hell out of plot armor, to the point it makes its super importance that you were constantly rubbing in our faces in the first 4 books completely worthless by now. Epic fail!And since I only had two more books in the series to read, and the last 70 pages of  Empire of Storms by Sarah J. Mass seems less appealing to me by the second, I continue on with my Harry Potter reread instead of just finishing Empire of Storms.This is my favorite book in the series. It's dark without being too dark, a lot of the characters who were just unbearably angsty in the previous book are more like their old selves, Hagrid is barely in the book, and there's almost as little Quidditch inAnd since I only had two more books in the series to read, and the last 70 pages of  Empire of Storms by Sarah J.

It's dark without being too dark, a lot of the characters who were just unbearably angsty in the previous book are more like their old selves, Hagrid is barely in the book, and there's almost as little Quidditch in it as the previous book. It's like all of my complaints about Order of the Phoenix are gone now with this book. I really enjoyed learning about Voldemort's past and how he became the dark lord, and Harry's time with Dumbledore. Although I found the whole \"he was always evil, even as a child,\" thing to be a bit lazy on the side of the author. She never really shows a turning point, a place where he turns bad, he was just always that way. I really like that Fleur, who has previously come off as pretty shallow, was abhored by the idea that she would leave Bill just because his face got torn up. The looks into Snape's past are pretty good too, and very subtle, in that you probably won't really see them on the first time through the book. I also really enjoy the ending of this book. The betrayal and death, the fight through the school and down onto the grounds after retrieving the fake Horcrux. I was so disappointed when the movie came out and it was like four people that invaded Hogwarts, and like just Harry trying to fight them off. I mean, this was a huge fight with dozens of people trying to kill each other, and destroying the school around them, and in the movie, Helena Bonham Carter skips around being Helena Bonham Carter and vandalizes the place before they walk out the front door. Whoopie. Whoever made that decision for the end of the movie needs a good kick in the ass. I also like how the love stories are used to bring levity to a pretty dark story, and don't really overstay their welcome. Thank god, a YA writer that understands that a love story SUBplot is a SUBplot, and not the main plot.Anyway, if you've recently stepped into our dimension from a parallel universe where Harry Potter doesn't exist and have never heard of it before, please pick it up. It's a pretty fun and entertaining series for what it is.~ Annual Reread - August 2016I will write a review when I surface from the puddle of emotion that I am even after the like 7th-or-something-like-that-time of reading this.Okay.This one is probably my third favorite in the series and is most definitely one of the quickest reads, I think.

It is very action packed and fast paced and altogether just a very well rounded story. My absolute favorite parts of this book are the lessons Harry takes up with Dumbledore. For one, we get to see a lot more of Dumbledore, and a much more personal side of him that we haven't seen too much of before this moment; and for two, I just absolutely love learning about the past in this world; both of the marauders and as it is in this case, Tom Riddle. Harry and Dumbledore's relationship of a mentor and a pupil, almost a father figure, progresses greatly throughout the events of this story and we as readers really grow it love Dumbledore even more than we already do after seeing a more personal and caring side of him. On the subject of Draco Malfoy: I know that there are plenty of people out there who absolutely love Draco and some that even romanticize his character. Now, I will be the very first to admit that I have never understood that love people seem to have for him. I have always found him a manipulative, cruel, bully who does things for his own gain and to see the humiliation of others. As I've said before, I do realize he's a product of his environment and the way he treats people is what he picked up from his parents but I will never, ever, understand how people can call him brave or just a simply misunderstood kid. He always runs away from a fight or anything in which he won't benefit from, and he isn't 'misunderstood' in the sense that there's another side of him that's actually good; he's a rude and vengeful bully who could be good if he realized an accepted that what he's been taught is wrong, but until that time comes he's just a mean, spoiled, coward who would do anything to save his own skin. Did I feel sorry for Malfoy at any point in this novel as he is dealing with his mission? Sure. Did the sympathy I felt for the difficult situation he was in cancel out the way he has treated everyone that he has bullied in the five books leading up to this novel? No. He even continues to prove that he doesn't care for others safety and is willing to put innocent people at risk to save himself; shown in his attack, whether intentional or not, on Katie Bell and Ron as they were both grievously injured and almost killed because Malfoy didn't have the boldness to do what he had been threatened to do and didn't care who got hurt along the way. Obviously I'm glad that he's a spineless prat and didn't kill his intended target, but his basic lack of respect for innocent people has always bothered me. My newfound Harry/Ginny shipper heart was made very happy during this book, with all of the cute scenes leading up to when Harry finally realizes he has feelings for Ginny that are more than that of a friend. So many little things in the series led up to this coupling, as I have pointed out in other reviews and little things that I have paid more attention to this time around on my reread. Proof, in my mind, that they belong together because they can truly, fully understand each other. Or mainly, that Ginny is one of the few people in Harry's life that kind of can understand what it's like to have their life controlled and taken over by Lord Voldemort. The end of this book will never not be heart wrenching and absolutely devastating. This was actually the first book ever in which I felt truly and utterly betrayed by a book character. Even rereading it now for the millionth time, knowing the full story, I am still horrified by the tragic blow that the Order, and honestly Harry, is dealt in that pivotal scene. I cried my eyes out for literally the last two chapters of this book, probably even harder than I usually do. This series has turned me into a puddle of emotion. Again.How can that blasted woman look so innocent, all blond hair and baby blues? And why do people keep having to die?I had my ideas and opinions all sorted, thinking I knew who was good and who was bad, and then she had to go and turn the tables on me from the very first page, which had me intrigued and slightly unsettled.That first chapter with the dynamics between the three ministers - Scrimgeour, Fudge and the Muggle Prime Minister - was a masterpiece.

And why do people keep having to die?I had my ideas and opinions all sorted, thinking I knew who was good and who was bad, and then she had to go and turn the tables on me from the very first page, which had me intrigued and slightly unsettled.That first chapter with the dynamics between the three ministers - Scrimgeour, Fudge and the Muggle Prime Minister - was a masterpiece. We have three politicians, each of them fighting for supremacy over the other two, but only one of them seems to realize that there is no supremacy to be had, because there's something much more powerful threatening to crush them all. That's when I suddenly started understanding and almost liking Fudge, with all of his fear and mistrust and resignation.Surprises are not over: the second chapter had me tied in knots and set the feeling for the whole book. That's when I started being actually scared - I felt like I didn't know anything anymore and started making guesswork and wondering about every little piece of information I was drip-fed. Oh, and I began feeling sorry for everyone, too - namely, in this case, Narcissa.Just a little while later - this book is chock-full of wonderful scenes - there's Harry's discussion with Scrimgeour, and I was all like \"Oh my, little Harry is so brave and mature!\" from then on. Really, his badassery amazed me. He's clever, loyal, strong - can I have one too?A while later (it seems like a few hours later to me, but that's because I read the whole book in three days - it's probably something like 400 pages later) there's Aragog's burial, where Harry finally manages to get that memory out of Slughorn. I swear, I wanted to cry with Hagrid and Slughorn. I mean, Hagrid loves a spider, which in and of itself is good enough a reason to hate him forever, and Slughorn may very well have given TR the means to rule the world, but how can you not feel bad seeing two grown men cry?And finally, Harry's breakup with Ginny. It's not a particularly significant scene because of the love story, because, as much as I like Ginny, so far I can't really feel the lurve, but Harry's grown up so much! *cries* Can you believe that six years have passed? Six years? When did that happen?Dumbledore. Dumbledore, Dumbledore, Dumbledore. Oh, sweet baby Jesus. Okay, I didn't cry this time - but it was hard. I had to work to stop myself.I loved him in this book. Totally, positively loved him. Mostly because I finally got to see him as, yes, a powerful wizard, a smart man, a wonderful father figure - but also a fundamentally frail old man.Obviously, I can't not mention all the new couples. Lupin/Tonks gets a wholehearted thumb up, I'm still a bit doubtful about Bill/Fleur, although it's actually sweet how she doesn't even think about leaving him (poor Bill...), Hagrid/Maxime is adorable, Harry/Ginny is cute but I need to see more, and... Ron/Hermione. Gosh, get your head out of your ass, guys. I need that now.So, even though this book basically left me with a sense of complete and utter desperation, the prospect of Ron/Hermione is keeping me alive. So far.Oh, and I want to kill Snape - but not really, which is unbelievable. I mean, he killed (view spoiler)[Dumbledore (hide spoiler)], for fuck's sake! He hates everyone, he's a bad man, he's coldhearted and ambitious and vicious! But, but, but... he did make an (view spoiler)[Unbreakable Vow (hide spoiler)], so he couldn't very well get out of it.

That about sums it up.Ugh ugh ugh, this one took me forever to read. I don't know why. Well, besides the fact that it's really long. They're all really long. Usually my brain explodes if a book is more than 400 pages or so. I can't even remember where the fifth book ended and the sixth book started ... so much stuff happens. Sorry if I kind of rush through this review. It's just that, I figure everyone has already read this so like, why bother? Also I'm tired and sick, and an old lady attacked me yesterday. And there's another book review I'm going to write after this one that I REALLY want to write so I just want to get this one over with. And if you're reading this you've most likely already read this book so WHY DO YOU CARE?Okay, I'll sum up my thoughts the best I can, in a very concise manner. It's pretty much everything I've already said in my reviews for the first five books, so yeah.This one was sad. The end was depressing, even though I knew what happened. Poor Dumbledore. :'(Harry is kind of annoying, but oh well. I like Ron and Hermione. They are so cute. They seem quite realistic too. There's none of that sappy, over-the-top romance in these books. All the romance stuff is like, bickering teenagers, which is much more amusing and believable.I don't really like Ginny much, though. I wish she was more interesting ... Maybe she will be developed more in the last book? Also Harry's interest in her seemed rather sudden and random. Like one day he's just like, \"Ginny is kind of hot. I like her. Oh, but she's Ron's sister. Awkward turtle.\" And then he wouldn't quit whining about it. Ack. Well, whatever. Voldemort is a creeper. I love his life history and whatnot, though. It's super cool.It still blows my mind that J.K. Rowling thought out this series so much. It makes me feel like such a slob as a writer. I'm always like, \"I should probably explain this .... NAH. No one will care.\" But, you know, people do care. So I should probably care more, too. But I don't think I'd have as much patience as Rowling does. I mean, GOSSHHH she has a backstory for like every single character.So yeah, I think that's about it. Now I hope to finish up the last book and watch all the movies before the last movie comes out in errrm like half a month. Wish me luck! 29/12/2015Alternate title: \"Harry Potter and the Year Shit Got Real\". We get so much backstory on Voldemort here, but it's also a year of Harry dealing with incredibly adult concepts and events. He's not only freaking out about school and fighting Voldemort, he's dealing with disappointing his teachers, and having feelings for Ginny, and his best friends CLEARLY having feelings for each other but not being prepared to act on them yet. So he's trapped in a series of incredibly awkward situations29/12/2015Alternate title: \"Harry Potter and the Year Shit Got Real\".

He's not only freaking out about school and fighting Voldemort, he's dealing with disappointing his teachers, and having feelings for Ginny, and his best friends CLEARLY having feelings for each other but not being prepared to act on them yet. So he's trapped in a series of incredibly awkward situations while also learning about magic that's way above his current level of understanding. And basically, I just want to hug all of the characters. Except Snape. He can go die in a fire. 23/6/2014Like I said last time around, this is the book where Ginny comes into her own. It's also a book that's a lot more about Malfoy than it is about Harry. I mean, obviously it's told from Harry's perspective so it's still his story. But on rereads, it becomes apparent that Draco is on Struggle Street for the duration of this book. He's shoved into a situation he doesn't want to be in, he's pale and not sleeping, he's ignored by his teachers and constantly reprimanded by his head of house, and he has to resort to Moaning Myrtle for sympathy. In comparison, Harry's year is a walk in the park. ANYWAY. As is always the case, I found new things this time around, but this time the new thing was rather profound: \"Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realise that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different!\" (Dumbledore to Harry, p. 477) Excuse me while I go and think serious thoughts.2/1/2013I love this book. Like, so much. The ending kills me EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. There's so much backstory, so much explanation of WHY Voldemort is the way he is. I must confess, I DO love Deathly Hallows just that little bit more, but I think that's because of the sense of closure we get. This, however, is the book that makes me wish Ginny had been more prevalent in Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, and Order of the Phoenix. Because Ginny is freaking AWESOME. She's a total badass, and it sucks that her character spends so much of the series languishing in the background because Harry's too much of a dipshit to notice that she's there. I can understand why some people don't like it - there's a lot of detail, and all the action is crammed into the last fifty or so pages. But at the end of the day, this book serves as a set up to the big finale in Deathly Hallows. And it does so admirably. So I feel I must publicly expound my Severus Snape theory before the last Harry Potter book comes out. I know, it's a total guilty pleasure, but damnit, I love that ragtag bunch of misfit wizards. So prepare to be awed by my genius analysis of the eternal question: Is Severus Snape evil? Well, in one word - Completely. Quiet down, quiet down, quit your uproaring and just hear me out.

Well, in one word - Completely. Quiet down, quiet down, quit your uproaring and just hear me out. In the world that Rowling created for Harry Potter almost every character is either goodness and light or darkness and doom. Sure they have conflicts and sometimes shit ain't easy, but their motivations are always clean cut. Snape is the one mystery. He seems evil, but he protects Harry, sort of. Dumbledore trusts him, but he makes pacts with the Malfoys. What's a muggle to think? Well, I'll tell you what to think. Snape is only looking out for #1. He's got designs on blossoming from the picked on nerdy potions kid to the unquestioned dark overlord or everything. Oh, spoiler alert: If you haven't read the 6th book, I'm totally about to blow the ending for you. You might be saying, 'Well then why does Dumbledore trust him? Dumbledore's super smart and would know if he was evil.' Well it's because when Dumbledore asks him, \"No, seriously Snape, are you done with Voldemort?\" Snape can say, \"Of course, guy,\" and be telling the truth. He's done with that shit and he's got his eyes on the prize for himself. Even under the control of the Veritaserum he can honestly say he's not working for old Voldy. So thus he gains Dumbledore's trust in that he's no longer a Death Eater. Booyakasha! (And how genius was it for Snape to arrange a plan with Dumbledore to kill him (Dumbledore) at the end of the 6th book!? We all know that shit was preordained, what with all the \"Snape, you just gotta do it,\" jive by big D. So everyone's led to think that even though Snape now seems like a bad guy he really isn't. Oh you poor, feeble-minded saps.) Ok, so now you're going to ask why would Snape ever protect Harry? He hates Harry's dad and he's got no love for the boy either, so why has he saved him in the past? BECAUSE Harry's the only one who can destroy Voldemort and quite possibly vice versa. So what's Snape gonna do? He's gonna pit the two of them against one another and let them destroy each other. Then the way will be clear for Snape to rule unopposed. Ha! Goddamn I'm a genius!

I also feel that this one brought back the little things you overlook in the beginning are actually important. I didn't know who the Prince was, though when I was throwing around guesses, I did have it correct. I just didn't have it pegged as that person, but I wasn't surprised to find out. The Weasleys remain the best characters in these books, though Ron is falling out of favor with me. I am so happy that Fred and George got their joke shop! The lessons with Dumbledore was brilliant. There was plenty of Dumbledore's sage advise dispensed in this book. I especially liked what he said about fear at the lake. Speaking of which, the bodies in the lake was super creepy. It reminded me of the Dead Marshes in Lord of the Rings. So glad I did not read that part at night!I did have the ending spoiled before I made it that far. I'm quite upset about that, as I probably should feel more shocked and depressed about it than I actually feel. I was shocked and livid when I heard the spoiler, so.....Snape remains the most intriguing character. I am absolutely convinced that there is much more going on than meets the eye.Neville was barely in this book, which was disappointing after his character really developing in Order of the Phoenix. The whole thing with Tonks and Lupin seemed a little convenient. I NEED BOOK 7 NOWI flipped back and forth between the book and the audio. I do this when my life is really busy and have the option to flip back and forth. You have no idea how much I would love to flip between audio, book, and kindle to fit my reading situation, without having to find my place in each one when I switch formats. Anyway, I had the Jim Dale audio, which I found mediocre at best. Some of his voices and inflections were weird. I always think when I pick up a Harry Potter book yet again, that there will be a day when I grow tired of the same story, that I will no longer yearn to hear it again. But in my third time rereading the series in it's entirety, I have found that this isn't so - I yearn even MORE to keep rereading.You see, for me, Harry Potter is like a childhood bedtime story: no matter how many times I hear the story, I can't stop reading, can't stop wanting to hear it again, to live in the world one more timeI always think when I pick up a Harry Potter book yet again, that there will be a day when I grow tired of the same story, that I will no longer yearn to hear it again.

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince often gets a rap as the least-liked book in the series, where Harry is the most whiney and obnoxious. In this sixth book of the series, Harry appears very self-involved, constantly stirring over his Potions books, that formerly belonged to the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. He is also torn romantically, pining over someone he doesn't feel he should.Ron and Hermione are at odds for most of the book, neither one wanted to admit or be honest with the other about the true nature of their relationship.Despite Harry becoming Quidditch caption, the game is one of the last things on his mind.And yes, there is that weird stalker-ish obsession Harry has with Malfoy that no one, even Ron and Hermione, think is rational.But despite all of Harry's observable faults in this book, I think it is close to the top of the list as my favorite. I didn't used to think so when I was younger (I was 16 when HBP first came out), but reading it now, nine years later, it is clear that this book is so incredibly complex and detailed.As always, the last 100 pages of the book proved almost too *intense/full of feels*, for lack of a better term, to take. I cried even though I knew what was coming because I love these characters so much, they are part of me.I am very anxious to finish The Deathly Hallows soon so I can go back and marathon all the movies and take notes on my opinions regarding the adaptations of my favorite series!So in summation, there just simply isn't anything like HP for me. Always the best! Always 5 stars :)I admit this is a re-read, as I have of course read this book before, when it first came out in 2005. I haven't read it since, however, and the way my brain retains information (ie: it doesn't) it was almost like reading it for the first time. Which is why I'm counting it here. I'm one of the many who have been following Harry in his adventures with much interest and glee, and this book held as much magic for me as all of the previous ones.

I'm one of the many who have been following Harry in his adventures with much interest and glee, and this book held as much magic for me as all of the previous ones. I'm especially thrilled with how much these books have \"grown up\" along with the characters (and, presumably, most of the readers). I know a lot of people didn't like how Harry fell for Ginny, but I didn't mind it. And the insights into Tom Riddle's life was very interesting; while Voldemort will always be the stereotypical bad guy, it was great to know how and why he is the way he is. I also got a kick out of Slughorn, and one of my favorite scenes is at the Christmas party when Slughorn has his arm around Snape, talking about his \"star pupil\". Snape continues to be extremely interesting too - and the fact that he IS the Half-Blood Prince that Harry (and Ron!) have been \"worshipping\" via his old textbook speaks volumes as well (ha, I punned). I've always been a Snape-lover, and when he killed Dumbledore I was surprised (at least, I was the first time I read the book!) but I very quickly came to the conclusion that this was planned between him and Dumbledore; that Dumbledore's pleading \"Severus, please\" was not for his life, but for his death. Because of his withered arm and weakness from the potion he'd drunk, I'm also very convinced that Dumbledore was probably dying anyway.It was good to give this book a very close re-read, since the final book came out, and that review follows...The penultimate novel of Harry Potter's saga distills darkness for all its four sides.

In this sixth part of Harry Potter's story, the stakes are higher than ever, new revelations come to light and there are great emotional upheavals - good and bad. Still as compelling as it was the very first time I read it!4.5 stars. As with the previous novels, this series continues to grow up, just like its central character. While still very much apporpirate for myounger readers, the themes and issues addressed and the reactions of the characters to events in the story have a much more adult feeling to them. Oh yeah, it is also a ton of fun and I highly recommend it.

Fue alucinante la manera que tuvo Harry de enfrentarse a Rufus Scrimgeour, Harry nunca la buscado ser el h\u00e9roe ni recibir elogios, pero la verdad es que se lo merece todo. Hasta ahora este es el libro en el que Dumbledore ha tenido m\u00e1s protagonismo, y claro que eso me emociona much\u00edsimo. Es un gran hombre, mago y aparte muy inteligente y bondadoso, en pocas palabras Dumbledore es un personaje muy pero que muy virtuoso que ha hecho el libro m\u00e1s interesante al contar un poquito de todo lo que \u00e9l sabe. Todos los flashbacks que Dumbledore le muestra a Harry son super absorbentes y originales y ni hablar de todas las conclusiones que Dumbledore saca al respecto, es sencillamente incre\u00edble.

Possibly one of the largest spoilers of all time. At least in terms of people being upset finding it out before reading it. I remember being at a convention the year this came out and people seemed to be making it a point of yelling (view spoiler)[Snape kills Dumbledore (hide spoiler)]. I put that in tags on the very slim chance you either haven't read the book, or somehow avoided that. If you did, I'm impressed. Tell me what your secret is please!People got really creative about this too. I remember someone did a mashup with castaway where Tom Hanks was keeping a copy of the book in that unopened package and then someone flew by the island with the spoiler on a banner behind the plane.I also recall just before the final book came out, people who preordered from Walden books had their choice of bookmark one saying (view spoiler)[Trust Snape (hide spoiler)], and the other: (view spoiler)[Snape is a very bad man (hide spoiler)]. I think I was more in the former camp, than the latter, but it's hard for me to remember anymore.Above all I think this division among readers during what felt like a very long waiting time until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out, is what is best about this book. It is certainly THE cliffhanger of the series.Also, in this book, Ms. Rowling finally starts to reveal some of the deeper secrets of the series as Harry and Dumbledore explore memories of the past.As a grown adult, I find the descriptions of (view spoiler)[Harry's feelings toward Ginny (hide spoiler)] both amusing and nostalgic. I remember having similar feelings when I was I was high school. I don't miss that \"monster\" as Harry calls it.[Snape kills Dumbledore (hide spoiler)][Trust Snape (hide spoiler)][Snape is a very bad man (hide spoiler)][Harry's feelings toward Ginny (hide spoiler)]First read: 2006Re-read: Every year I thinkReadalong: #MYPotteheadsReadathon on January, 2016.Actual Rating: NO AMOUNT OF STARS CAN RATE HOW AMAZING THIS BOOK IS*a very angsty review below do not read if you're not ready*I remember when I first read this book.

I was such a rebellious teenager keep trying out all my silly phases I want to be u0026amp; it was hilarious! Also, when I first finished this book, I appreciate it a little more because we have a 600 bloody pages of Harry Potter book where Harry focused more on Slytherin characters u0026amp; it made my entire year! The mourning period when I finished this book was so excruciating that I took a day off school because I was busy crying my heart out (the night before) for everything that had happened u0026amp; what about to happened in the last book with all those theories u0026amp; questions keep circling around my mind for so long.This year when I finally decided to join the read-along, I never imagined that it'll be more hurtful that previous years.. From the start, I was so excited to re-read this book u0026amp; the moment I was reading it, I never thought of losing one of the casts who portrayed a HUGE u0026amp; IMPORTANT character in my favourite book will be leaving us. A really tragic news for The Potterheads family including JK Rowling. I was clutching the book when I heard about the news u0026amp; it hit me hard. The book used to make me hate Snape so much but after all this years, I understood what he stood for u0026amp; why he did what he did but that didn't mean that I hate Alan himself. He's such a talented person u0026amp; wonderful human being. He brought what Snape really should be to life u0026amp; I will always be grateful for that.My 1st memory of Alan Rickman was when I was six (15 years ago). My dad brought me to the Philosopher's Stone screening then we bought the book u0026amp; I ended up reading it that night. The scene I remember most was Snape's potion class u0026amp; I think the reason is because of how scary (at that age) I though Snape was but Alan portrayed his part u0026amp; character amazingly well. It might not seem much to people, but it's my first HP memory u0026amp; it happened to include Alan.Gone.. but never forgotten. You'll be remembered as the bravest man we've ever known. You made my childhood more imaginative u0026amp; magical. My thoughts are with his family u0026amp; friends. Rest in peace, Sir Alan Rickman. The world will miss you. Always.

This book has more romance than any the rest of the Harry Potter series and has a teenage soap opera feel to it. When I first read this book I never guessed that Snape was the Half-Blood Prince and he had such a big role in this book and the next book. Hermione says that love potions are not that dangerous but in the wrong hands it can be used very unethically and even as a date rape drug. I really liked learning more about Voldemort\u2019s past and how young Tom Riddle became Voldemort. I love the Weasley family as they are kind and warm and the family that Harry had never had. I did find it odd that Harry mourned more for Cedric, an acquaintance and kind of friend, than Sirius, his Godfather and someone he saw as a father figure. But I did like how Harry and Hermione\u2019s friendship grows closer in this book as it always felt Harry was closer to Ron than Hermione. This is the one book which you can tell it was written by a woman, this is because the way Rowling wrote Hermione\u2019s action and reactions to Ron fit perfectly to how most girls would act. One thing is that Harry likes dull chicks, as while Ginny is described as being fun and feisty I just never saw it, and it felt I was told this, not shown it. Also Dumbledore is such a liar as he said he had told Harry everything about Voldemort and Harry, but he really didn\u2019t, and it shows that even after all those years he still believes in The Greater Good (\u201cThe Greater Good\u201d). Is it just me or does Professor Slughorn with his bald head and walrus moustache remind you of Jamie from Mythbusters? I love Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this series. This and my other reviews can be found at Amethyst BookwyrmThis has got to be the best cliffhanger ever. There is such power in this book. It is my favorite in the series for one very important reason: since book one, Severus Snape has been my favorite character and this is his book, albeit not his story yet. His power, his intelligence, his confusing range of emotions and allegiance, finally come to full attention. I argued with many a doubter about his motives, and yet in my wildest imagination, I could not have justified him as well as Rowling doesThis has got to be the best cliffhanger ever. There is such power in this book. It is my favorite in the series for one very important reason: since book one, Severus Snape has been my favorite character and this is his book, albeit not his story yet. His power, his intelligence, his confusing range of emotions and allegiance, finally come to full attention. I argued with many a doubter about his motives, and yet in my wildest imagination, I could not have justified him as well as Rowling does is book 7. Even knowing the ending beforehand, I still found myself wanting more in the inadequate moments between Harry and Dumbledore. The sense of longing was perfectly planted for our heightened frustration and sadness in the end. I figured it was going to happen anyway, but it still got me. Rowling pulls you into these characters' lives. You are at Hogwarts mourning, afraid, alone with the lot of them. Even the emotional conclusion of book 7 did not affect the same power of emotion in readers you find in book 6. But more than wishing for more time for Harry, I wanted (needed) to understand the anger and sadness in Snape's verbal attack. That is the beauty of book 6 is the ambiguity of it.Initially I was frustrated between the summarizing instead of detailed accounts Rowling uses in every other book, but it correlates perfectly with the ambiguity of the story. This one got people talking (all I wanted to do after reading it was discuss). It left room for interpretation. Most importantly it left us impossibly waiting for a series conclusion. I reread book 6 a week before the release of book 7 and my anticipation was so high even those few days of waiting were agony. \u0628\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u06a9\u0647 \u06a9\u0644\u06cc

I found all that teenage angst and agonizing over relationships -albeit accurately portrayed- a bit tedious and tiresome. Voldemort's backstory was very intriguing. That said, the sixth book is not the best in the series in my opinion, but it's very, very good in its own right. So far, I like The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire best. But still, The Half-Blood Prince is a terrific book and the rest are excellent. I cannot wait to read the finale. However, it won't be my next read because I don't want the series to end just yet. They've been insanely entertaining and enchanting reads.THE HALF BLOOD PRINCE IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! Oooooh!!! u0026lt;3 Honestly I ended up watching all the movies before reading the books (ashamed :( ) but because if that I have been absolutly dying to read the Half Blood Prince.

Rowling)**Read at your own risk**All is not going pretty well in the wizarding world.As dark forces gather, no one and no place is safe. Wizards and witches are being kidnapped, attacked at every turn and some murdered in cold blood. The obituary pages of the Daily Prophet are browsed with as much frequency as the headlines. Nasty turns of events are also felt by the Muggle government as Lord Voldemort and his cohorts wreak havoc on the non magical population. The Ministry of Magic, on the contrary, is doing one hell of a bad job from preventing these and doing all it can to cover up their inadequacies \u2014 much to the chagrin of the wizarding community.However, for Harry, Ron and Hermione, life must go on. In their sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, on the prospect of choosing a future career path, they will learn how to Apparate; will have their (yet again) new Defense Against the Dark Arts, as well as, Potions teacher; and like any regular teens undergoing adolescence will learn to fall in and out of love \u2014 flirtations and stalkers included. Still, there are far more that Harry is preoccupied with. For one, there\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s badly injured hand which he declines to explain and his frequent absences from Hogwarts. Moreover, Harry receives helpful advices from a battered Potions book annotated by someone enigmatically named as the Half-Blood Prince.The beauty of the Harry Potter series is in its structure: with every succeeding volume as we follow Harry through his schooling with his bunch of friends, devoted fans and readers grows along with them. Its genius lies in its utterly captivating magical alternate world of wands and flying broomsticks and as the book\u2019s pages and plot alike thickens, it expands our wonder and amazement at J.K. Rowling\u2019s wicked inventiveness. Constantly present in all the six books I\u2019ve read so far is Rowling\u2019s deftness in creating a character-driven story that engagingly melds a coming-of-age narrative with a dash of action-thrilling scenes interwoven with elements of a quest tale and intriguing mystery to boot. To read her books is like tumbling down a rabbit hole of half-remembered childhood delight, of being under a spell akin to discovering the joys of reading such a good book for the first time.Taking center stage in the sixth volume is Lord Voldemort\u2019s back story from his infamous predecessors; the circumstances surrounding his birth; how he came about his prodigious capacities; his schooling at Hogwarts; his continuing interest and gravitation toward the dark arts; up to how he ultimately reinvented himself as the Dark Lord, whom everyone fears, that Harry discovers via the magical device called the Pensieve, a repository for people\u2019s memories, with Dumbledore as his guide. Right now I\u2019m still marveling how cleverly Rowling used this enchanted tool, fusing it as a narrative contrivance to tell us these flashbacks, which I think was employed rather too much, but with the way she teases our minds with tidbits of clues makes me forgive her at that.Prince is definitely treading on darker grounds and, being one with others who noticed earlier, the occurrences depicted in the book do strike some resemblances to our paranoid times besieged with constant threats of terrorism. Students pass through a sensor (which Rowling called a \u201cProbity Probe\u201d) upon entering or leaving school grounds. Stan Shunpike, a character introduced in the third book as the Knight Bus\u2019s conductor, was arrested in a Guantanamo-style preventive detention on the basis of being a Death Eater without even substantial evidence. Then there\u2019s the Horcruxes which can be made by splitting one\u2019s soul through the act of murder that rendered Lord Voldemort near-immortal and one of the reasons why he\u2019s still alive after the curse trying to kill baby Harry backfired. Well, how more evil can you get than that?Of course one of the memorable and saddest parts of the book is Prof. Dumbledore\u2019s untimely demise which makes this installment the most unsettling and emotionally-charged thus far. At first there\u2019s denial, but as the sudden realization sinks in, you really can\u2019t do anything but accept it. It\u2019s such an emotional blow to Harry and the readers that such a noble character, being the most powerful wizard of the age and the only one feared by the Dark Lord, is also susceptible, all too mortal like us.Harry is tougher now, in complete control of his temper and emotions and unafraid to challenge authority figures. One of the scenes that I really liked is when he nonchalantly and frankly declines the offer of the new Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, to be the Ministry\u2019s poster boy. All too well aware of loss and death, no one can endure such hardships without being altered, and Harry is no exception. His responsibility of being the \u201cChosen One\u201d coupled with his growing reputation as the symbol of hope tasked to vanquish Lord Voldemort makes him increasingly isolated; causing him to sacrifice his romantic involvement with Ginny Weasley given the dangers he would have to face and the burden of playing the role of a lone hero. More than asserting himself of being a \u201cDumbledore\u2019s man through and through\u201d he must learn to be his own. Only by seeking his own identity armed and protected by his ability to love, might be his only slim chance to overcome the looming dark tide of war. It\u2019s such a shame that he sees his capacity to show human tenderness as both a distraction and a weakness, though this attribute, in reality, distinguishes him from his evil adversary as Dumbledore pointed out.Watching the movie first took most of the fun I could have had derived from reading the book. Actually, this one has become a perfunctory reading for me just to be reminded of the plot points (that the screen adaptation brazenly dispense with) as I prepare myself for the highly-anticipated final book in the series. Yet when I started to speculate, think of what might happen to Harry, of what\u2019s in store for him in his quest to destroy the Hocruxes amd his eventual battle with Lord Voldemort in the seventh book is where, I think, the real fun starts. If, in reading this book review bored you enough, then let me tickle your brains with enough questions that remain and begs to be answered:\u00b7 Where does Snape\u2019s loyalty lie? Is he really a Death Eater or in fact acting as a double agent for the Order of the Phoenix? For Snape haters they maybe resigned to the former but as I\u2019ve come to learn from reading this series, nothing and no one is what it seemed to be. I\u2019m hoping that he\u2019ll redeem his character and may have some credible explanation why he did what he has to do in this novel.\u00b7 Is the locket referred to in passing in the fifth book the same as the fake one Harry and Dumbledore found in the cave? If so, then who got it now? Does Kreacher have it since he\u2019s the caretaker of 12 Grimmauld Place or was it stolen by Mundungus Fletcher?\u00b7 And who is this person with the mysterious initials R. A. B. that switched the real locket with a fake one? What is his agenda for doing this? Will Harry be able to speak with him or has he taken his story to the grave?\u00b7 How will Harry proceed now without Dumbledore to guide him and as clueless as it was in the beginning to the whereabouts of the remaining Horcruxes? What were James and Lily Potter were like when tragedy hadn\u2019t befallen them yet? Furthermore, what are the similarities and circumstances that connect Harry to Lord Voldemort that\u2019s left to be uncovered?More than being an exciting denouement and the penultimate in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a good introduction to the last and final book. Like previous books we still hunger to know more about these characters that we\u2019ve grown so much to love, following their fate that\u2019s inextricably tied to the two wizards that will shape wizarding history to come. I\u2019m still clueless how the series will be heading.As the story grips us spellbound, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll still be gaping, enchanted and bracing for more\u2026_____________Published by Scholastic Inc.

I'm sure I've written about it in a review before, but I'm going to recount it -- briefly -- here. We were in Japan, on a night train. (I already felt pretty magical, being in a foreign place AND being on a night train meant I could pretend I was on the Knight Bus.) Shut myself up with this book, and the only memory I have is of eagerly reading \"The Cave\", vividly imagining myself there, too, with Harry and Dumbledore, battling the Inferni.This is my favorite Harry Potter book. The memories, the feeling of it really coming together more, the story and the mystery on two levels. Who is the Half-Blood Prince? What is Malfoy up to? It enticed me as a child, and still gets me to this very day.It's a great book, and it shows JK's real depth of knowledge with this series. I can't imagine the world-building she did for this series, and every time I read it I find it utterly incredible to see little details that show it again and again.Now that I've gotten the gushing out of the way, the rest of my review is going to be focused on a character. I ran a poll for this, because I couldn't decide. The poll results were that I talk about my opinions and feelings about Dumbledore. Aka, this is where I spoil book seven if you haven't read it already, and maybe also make you hate me a bit.I have a real love/hate relationship with Dumbledore's character now that I'm older. When I was younger, I was very much like Harry; I was in awe of Dumbledore, and I thought he could do no wrong. As I grew, I still felt that, but I also could see things that he shouldn't have done. I still thought he was a great character, a trustworthy one. Now, I'm very conflicted. Throughout this series, I've been reading for Dumbledore's character, and I can honestly say I feel more enlightened now that I have. Yet, I'm conflicted. On one hand, I see Dumbledore as an amazing mentor who is flawed, but aren't all adults? He made some bad choices, ones that haunted him for the rest of his life and, again, what adult hasn't done that? Then, on the other hand I see him, again, as very flawed. However, I see him as power hungry. Not in the political sphere, but in another way. Knowledge. Defeating people. And, what we discover about his past in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows doesn't make that feeling go away, merely strengthen it.One of my favorite things, which ties into this, on the internet with theories is about The Three Brothers analogy. Voldemort is the first, power hungry, brother. Snape is the second brother, who pines for the past. Harry is the third brother, who welcomes Death as an old friend. And Dumbledore is Death. It's a great analogy.I can see pieces of Dumbledore in all of them.Voldemort, of course, is extremely power hungry. But, he and Dumbledore are, in a way, alike. As we find out in the final book, we know that Dumbledore was involved with another dark wizard. He agreed that wizards are best and Muggles need to be, slightly, put in their place. He plotted a takeover. The power got to his head, as you see it happen throughout the series in front of you. Dumbledore and finding out that Voldemort has his body back; a new challenge, something new to take down. Dumbledore and the Horcruxes. Dumbledore and the Deathly Hallows. He is drawn to power. Perhaps he doesn't want it for himself, but it entices him. Which makes him somewhat like Voldemort.On the other hand, Dumbledore is incredibly like Snape. Snape will have a whole review dedicated to him, don't worry. He pines for the past, which people know if you've read the whole series. Dumbledore does as well. He never forgives himself for involving himself with a dark wizard and the terrible outcome of that: His sister's death. In \"The Cave\" chapter, you see that so vividly, and it honestly hurts to read it. You can imagine that anguish, that deep hatred for yourself. And... it hurts.And, finally, there's Harry. Dumbledore welcomes death. He is not afraid of it, seeing it as an inevitable end and the next great adventure. After so many years of escaping it, he finally meets it because there's no other way.Dumbledore is one of the most complex characters I've met in a children's book. When you're young, you can see him as perfect. The older you get, the more flaws you see. It's incredible what JK Rowling created, and I don't ever think I'll be able to put a finger on exactly how I feel about him.  CAUTION: SPOILERS I actually can't believe I'm on the last book already. I was always intimidated by the size of this series (and the size of the books in it), but it has flown by! So fast in fact that I don't want it to end. I am in awe at how much this series has gotten under my skin! I've tried to read other things in between, instead of just binge reading, but I've found that I have trouble getting into anything else because all I can think about is continuing the series. And I know I'm go    CAUTION: SPOILERS  I actually can't believe I'm on the last book already.

I've tried to read other things in between, instead of just binge reading, but I've found that I have trouble getting into anything else because all I can think about is continuing the series. And I know I'm going to have a book hangover from this series! It's definitely special, and it's going to be hard to read something that compares after this!  I have to say I was kind of underwhelmed with the reveal of Snape being the Prince. I mean, it made sense after Hermione explained it, but there wasn't really a big revelation there. It was just kind of like, Oh, I'm the Half Blood Prince...and then was barely mentioned again even though the book is named after him and the Prince's book was a major part of the whole story.  Also DUMBLEDORE OMG. I had trouble believing it at first, which is ridiculous - I remember his death very clearly in the movie, so I *knew* he was dead but even still, it didn't seem real! I still can't get over it. I did eventually start crying when they were all talking about it, and again at his funeral. I CANNOT DEAL. *sobs*  FINALLY, Harry and Ginny get together! I didn't realize how late in the series it happened. I kept waiting for it! Also, I kinda wanted to bash Ron's and Hermione's heads together. They clearly have the hots for each other!   Something I absolutely love about this series is that there is never a love triangle between Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Harry and Hermione are never more than just best friends. It's so rare to see platonic love in stories, and I wish there was more of it! Boys and girls CAN just be friends, people. I love that Harry and Hermione prove it. And it's absolutely beautiful! They are as close as brother and sister and I love it so much! I think their friendship is one of my favorites in fiction. I want a platonic friendship as deep as they have.

To see a breakdown of my assessment, please visit the full review here.This might be a disappointment to some of HP fans, for the lack of action in it, and might be a trophy to the other fans.As I said, it's the least action-packed book in the series by far, it wasn't a physical activity what Harry was going through, but a mental one.

Es una historia totalmente tr\u00e1gica y triste.De los detalles que m\u00e1s me emocionan es que tiene mayor importancia uno de mis profesores favoritos desde el principio de la saga: Snape. Como dije en La Piedra Filosofal, nunca supe bien que fue lo que me hizo elegirlo como mi profesor favorito (quiz\u00e1 el que fuera Jefe de mi Casa), pero realmente me molestaba que aunque aparec\u00eda seguido, no fuera importante para la historia. Y con este libro qued\u00e9 m\u00e1s que satisfecha en este punto. Ni que decir de mi amado y eterno crush potterico Draco. [Les juro que a pesar de considerar que Slytherin es la mejor Casa que existe, y ser fan de Draco y Snape, no pertenezco al lado oscuro XD]Realmente hubo cosas con las que sent\u00eda que me mor\u00eda de tristeza (quiz\u00e1 exagero, pero s\u00ed fue deprimente) y otras que me encantaron. Este libro me tuvo al borde de las emociones, del llanto y del asiento desde el principio.Para ver el resto de la saga    Harry Potter:                    \u201cAs he lay there, he became aware suddenly that the grounds were silent.

The last fifty pages were super intense.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is my third favourite from the series and I have my reason.

The last fifty pages were super intense.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is my third favourite from the series and I have my reason. In this book Snape finally got what he wanted aka the DADA post meanwhile Harry has taken a private lesson with Dumbledore to learn more about Voldemort\u2019s background and childhood. Voldemort, despite being a villainous piece of shit, is actually an interesting character. Unlike most villains in children\u2019s books (is Harry Potter even a children book, though? It\u2019s more, YA, i think?) Voldemort is actually dangerous and well.. a villain. He kills, he tortures, he steals, and he done it so well. He actually act like a true villain and to read about his childhood and his history, it was quite a ride. In this book we\u2019re also introduced to the Horcrux (which will lead to a satisfying but devastating conclusion in the next book) and that Harry actually had came across the Horcrux before (the diary in chamber of secret). So near the ending of the book Dumbledore and Harry went off to find one of the Horcrux and when they got back to Hogwarts they found the dark marks glowing bright. Then the worst thing happen, Snape killed Dumbledore. If you haven\u2019t read book 7 you will be furious because all your worst suspicion about Snape finally came true. (But if you have read book 7 you will understand that killing Dumbledore wasn\u2019t easy for him nor was it his decision). I was so sad when Hagrid found Dumbledore\u2019s death (his death itself wasn\u2019t that sad for me). Hagrid had always said about how much of a good man Dumbledore was, he trusted him, looked up to him, loved him even. I don\u2019t like to think about how devastating it was for Hagrid to be the one who had to carry Dumbledore away, to hold his lifeless body. I know, I know, I\u2019m getting melancholic, a bit emotional too, but it\u2019s bound to happen everytime I talk about something Harry Potter related.Once again I have to say that I\u2019m glad I got on the HP bandwagon when I was a kid. This feeling I am feeling right now isn\u2019t something I could feel towards books I read just recently. I can\u2019t quite describe it. Sometimes it is sadness, longing, and joy all mixed into one which I can only relate to something I love from my childhood. Is it nostalgia? Yes, i think it is. And this book is literally perfect. I couldn't find a single flaw at all and I probably will never change my mind about this.An Update:Last read December 9-11 2015Listened to the audiobook 22-24 august 2016Cried about 384746 times.Come on. It's Harry Potter . It would be great. There's no doubt. The new thing was that the hormones kicked them very hard.My heart hurts. I've never identified with Harry as much as this book. Glad to see Ginny be more.. Ginny and the twins were always a pleasure when encountered. This is one of the very few times I wish I'd never seen the movies or just read the books sooner because it must have been a real experience to not know the reasons behind Snape's actions in this book. 5 stars for obvious reasons.PerfectionI just read the last one hundred or so pages likeAnd then I closed the book likeBecause my emotions were in a roller coaster and it was amazing.Rowling just made me feel everything in this book, I was loving, laughing, crying, sobbing and the book moves in a perfect pace it never bored me, in fact I didn't want it to end.Before going there, to (view spoiler)[ Dumbledore's death (hide spoiler)] and all the pain I like just to say how much I love the \"minor\" characters in this series for[ Dumbledore's death (hide spoiler)]PerfectionI just read the last one hundred or so pages likeAnd then I closed the book likeBecause my emotions were in a roller coaster and it was amazing.Rowling just made me feel everything in this book, I was loving, laughing, crying, sobbing and the book moves in a perfect pace it never bored me, in fact I didn't want it to end.Before going there, to (view spoiler)[ Dumbledore's death  (hide spoiler)] and all the pain I like just to say how much I love the \"minor\" characters in this series for they all written in a manner that makes it impossible not to get attached to them.

Fawkes the phoenix let out a low, soft, musical cry. To Harry's intense embarrassment, he suddenly realized that Dumbledore's bright blue eyes looked rather watery, and stared hastily at his own knee. When Dumbledore spoke, however, his voice was quite steady. \"I am very touched, Harry.\u201d \u201cIt's going to be all right, sir,\" Harry said over and over again, more worried by Dumbledore's silence than he had been by his weakened voice. \"We're nearly there ... I can Apparate us both back ... don't worry ...\"\"I am not worried, Harry,\" said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. \"I am with you.\u201d A mess and yet I can tell this is one of my new favorite books.[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[ Dumbledore's death  (hide spoiler)]In a nutshell: Harry\u2019s adventures continue as he embarks on quests with Dumbledore in hopes to destroy Voldemort and is helped in Potions class with a battered old textbook... once owned by a potions master who refers to himself as \u201cthe Half-Blood Prince.\u201d Recommendation: This is obviously a must-read for people of all ages.

There are so many things that I forgot about like Hermione\u2019s house-elf liberation organization or the fact that Dobby appears more frequently than just in Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets. But I guess you can\u2019t fit EVERYTHING into a 2-hour movie. Honestly these books are disguised as children and young adult books but I think people of all ages should read the series because I think it\u2019s amazing for everyone really. Everyone can take some from these books. And that\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll go really because I know so many people have written about the series. I have to be honest I really couldn't remember much from this book apart from the tragic ending. It was so wonderful to be able to re read it like I hadn't read it before (yes my memory's that bad). All the parts they miss out in the film were so enjoyable to read!! I love Harry Potter more and more every single time.

Und nun schaue ich gleich den Film und starte morgen Band 7, miep.Edit:Eins noch: Gerade die letzten Szenen mit Harry und Dumbledore haben mich viel zu sehr an Gandalf und Moria erinnert. Und die Inferi im Wasser waren wir die Toten in den Dead Marshes oder wie die in HdR nochmal hie\u00dfen. Naja. Das nagt etwas an mir.THIS BOOK. This is without a doubt my favorite in the series. I absolutely loved learning about Voldemort before he was The Dark Lord. Everything about this book was amazing. Ugh and the death (let's keep it vague in case there are those people who have not read this series or seen the movies...they are still out there believe it or not) hurt me so much more than I expected.

I don't think there is really much for me to say about this book that hasn't already been said, so I'll just leave here with just two of my many favorite quotes from this book. ps. I find Harry and Ginny way cuter in the books than in the movies lol.  'I am not worried, Harry,' said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. 'I am with you.'  \"...whether in a month, a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.\" I love this book from start to finish. After the events of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, it's nice to settle down to a relatively quiet year a Hogwarts for Harry.The biggest improvement over OOTP is that Harry is no longer moody and irritable. It's nice to have a happy, stable main character for a change. Hermione continues to shine, Ron is entertaining as ever, and learning about Voldemort's history is fascinating.Rowling dives into teen romance now that the trio is 16/17 years oldI love this book from start to finish.

I think once I finish Deathly Hallows I will be doing a discussion video of sorts because often I'm asked why I don't rate all the HP books 5 stars or why it took me so long to read them etc. So yeah. Overall good book, 3.5/5 stars. And onto Deathly Hallows which is even bigger than this one. Oh boy. The sixth book has always been my favorite book, and this time was no different. I love this book because we learn more about the Horcruxes and we get to see all those glimpses of Voldemort's past. I obviously don't like Voldemort, but I think learning a villain's backstory is so interesting. I also love this book because Harry u0026amp;amp; Ginny finally get together (they are and always have been my #1 OTP). I always cry at the end, when Harry breaks it off with her and this time was no different. IThe sixth book has always been my favorite book, and this time was no different.

I always cry at the end, when Harry breaks it off with her and this time was no different. I really loved listening to this one for some reason. Maybe because this one is my favorite book in the series and I was just constantly craving the story, I don't know, but this audiobook was just so good. I'm pretty far down on the list for the 7th one, so it'll be a bit before I can finish the series. But that's okay, because there are so many other books to read in the meantime. This was my least favorite of the series, but I still give it a solid 4 stars. I am a confirmed and unrepentant PotterHead, so I was surprised that this one didn't hold me like the others (especially 4 u0026amp; 5 ... also 7, all of which ROCKED HARD) had.What I loved in 6 were: Snape and the Inferius.Inferius, because come on, zombies are SUPER COOL (Yeah!!!!) in whatever avatar.Snape, because SIGH, he gave up so much for love.

I just wish I hadn't given the other books 5 stars because this definitely merits a higher rating. \u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u060c \u062f\u0645\u0628\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u062a \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 ..\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062b\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u060c \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0629 \u060c \u0647\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0639\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0636\u0639\u0641 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646 \u060c \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0646\u0636\u062c\u062a \u0648\u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0644\u062d\u0648\u0638 \u0633\u064a\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0633 \u0633\u0646\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0648 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0631\u0623\u0633\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0642\u0628 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062a\u062e\u062f\u062a \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0634 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0638\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0623\u062e\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u062f\u0645\u0628\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0629\u062c\u064a \u0643\u064a \u0631\u0648\u0644\u0646\u062c \u0630\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0644\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0623\u0626\u0629 :-Prereading 2:as I reclaim my feeling back when I first watched the movies,\u062d\u0633\u0646\u0627 \u060c \u062f\u0645\u0628\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u062a \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u064a\u0639\u0631\u0641 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u064a\u0639 ..\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0634\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062b\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0645\u064a\u0645\u064a\u0629 \u060c \u0645\u0634\u0627\u0639\u0631 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0629 \u060c \u0647\u0627\u0631\u064a \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u0639\u062f \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0636\u0639\u0641 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0646 \u060c \u062d\u062a\u0649 \u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0646\u0636\u062c\u062a \u0648\u062a\u063a\u064a\u0631\u062a \u0628\u0634\u0643\u0644 \u0645\u0644\u062d\u0648\u0638 \u0633\u064a\u0641\u0631\u0648\u0633 \u0633\u0646\u0627\u0628 \u0648\u062f\u0631\u0627\u0643\u0648 \u0645\u0627\u0644\u0641\u0648\u064a \u0642\u0644\u0628\u0648\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0629 \u0631\u0623\u0633\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0639\u0642\u0628 \u0648\u0639\u0644\u0627\u0642\u0629 \u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0628\u0647\u0631\u0645\u064a\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u062a\u062e\u062f\u062a \u0645\u0633\u0627\u0631 \u062c\u062f\u064a\u062f \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0634 \u0645\u0628\u0627\u0634\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0646\u062a \u0628\u062f\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u0638\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0623\u062e\u0631 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0627\u0636\u062d \u0623\u0646\u0647 \u0633\u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u062f\u0645\u0628\u0644\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0641\u064a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0629\u062c\u064a \u0643\u064a \u0631\u0648\u0644\u0646\u062c \u0630\u0643\u064a\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0644\u0646 \u0623\u0645\u0644 \u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0623\u0626\u0629 :-Prereading 2:as I reclaim my feeling back when I first watched the movies, and how it was mesierable to not have Dumbledore any more!ofcoase back then I louthed Snape so much before knowing what Deathly hallows hold for us. and indeed, Rowling is genius no arguing xd\"It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high.Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways,but Dumbledore knew -

This book may or may not be the reason behind my purchasing the entire British hardback set.Gerade bei diesem Buch habe ich gemerkt, dass ich es echt etwas schade finde, dass ich zu erst die Filme damals gesehen habe und nicht die B\u00fccher gelesen. Denn bei dem wohl \u00fcberraschendsten Todesfall hier hat es sich komisch angef\u00fchlt, weil es eben anders war als im Film und na ja, es war etwas sehr verwirrend f\u00fcr meinen Kopf. Ich bin aber auch froh, dass ich die detailliertere Version auch nun endlich kenne :) \"Non sono preoccupato, Harry.\" rispose Silente, la voce un po' pi\u00f9 forte nonostante l'acqua gelata. \"Sono con te.\" Mi \u00e8 piaciuto leggermente meno rispetto all'Ordine della fenice, ma questa scena mi ha spezzato il corazon.(\u0391\u03c0\u03bd\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03af \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b4\u03cd\u03bf \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c4\u03c3\u03bf\u03cd\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b6\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03b3\u03cc \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1.)(\u039a\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03be\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03c9 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03c9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bf\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03c9\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b9\u03bf \u03b1\u03c5\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03ac, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03b3\u03bd\u03c9\u03c3\u03b7 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bb\u03c9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b7 \u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c1\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03ce \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b4\u03b5\u03c7\u03c4\u03ce \u03c0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b3\u03bb\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b7 JK \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7.)

Im broken.. I have NO words to describe the pain and the joy this book gave me.. I am speechless and it was simply amazing but painful! You can expect a bit of an emotional roller coaster.. It's so fun and so sad. The ending literally made me cry especially the very last chapter im so broken.. (:(I like this book but at the same time it makes me feel sad because Hogwarts brokers because Dombuldor dies so I think he was like the heart of Hogwarts and like everything gets disorder and the get invaded by the death-eaters (Voldemort's army).I think this book is probably better than the 3 stars I gave it, but I'm not sure because I also think I read most of it in my sleep when I had jet lag. Someday I'll re-read it and see how I feel then. I learned that I was far too addicted to characters over plot when this became my favourite Harry Potter book on the strength of getting to see more of the Slytherins...This one is so sad. God damn it. All these people that die AND I DON'T WANT THEM TO DIE. Damnit, J.K. :cBut I still love you. Omg I love it so much! It's so evil with snape and dumbledore (why :( ?!?!), etc.. ;)Haha you have to read it!This is most definitely my favorite HP book out of the series. Close call with Goblet of fire though... and Deathly Hallows... and all the others... Crap never mind I can't pick favorites. WOW, the ending is so much sadder than I remember it being.. I can't even imagine how people who had to wait for the release of Deathly Hallows must have felt right now. I diving into it at once!I had forgotten how much I loved this sixth book. Can't wait to dive into the seventh one, one more time.You'd think that reading the ending to Half Blood Prince would be easier, the second time around, wouldn't you. WELL, IT'S NOT. *heart breaks in ten thousand pieces*One more book to go! Not sure if I'm ready for that tho. Her seferinde a\u011flamasam ke\u015fke...I'm not crying, you are!*crying so much*This book's end breaks my heart every time...

I'm... I'm not crying. I'm not laying on the edge of my bed, completely immobilized and struggling to breathe. Really. I'm not. But I have to say that this book is probably my favourite of all the books in this series, even despite the inevitable death of one my most favourite and cherished characters.

Now, excuse me while I stare at the ceiling for the next couple of hours in complete despair.I don't really know what I think of the beginning, since the first two (clearly important) scenes are done outside Harry's frame of reference. The whole point of the books has been that we're in limited 3rd person POV - we find things out when Harry does. That's been the clearly established rule for 5 books, I don't understand why we're changing it in the 6th. Obviously the point of being an author is that you make the rules, but once you've made your own rules you're supposed to abide by themI don't really know what I think of the beginning, since the first two (clearly important) scenes are done outside Harry's frame of reference. The whole point of the books has been that we're in limited 3rd person POV - we find things out when Harry does. That's been the clearly established rule for 5 books, I don't understand why we're changing it in the 6th. Obviously the point of being an author is that you make the rules, but once you've made your own rules you're supposed to abide by them until you've also created an exception. That can be done more easily with substantive rules - you can have vampires wander around in direct sunlight eating garlic for all I care, if you say why you're doing it. But a style rule that's been clearly established isn't supposed to be broken, unless you need information that CAN'T be conveyed any other way, and I don't see why she couldn't have conveyed the information in those scenes later in the book in the usual way. Okay, yes, it's clearly important that we know about the Unbreakable Vow, but Harry found out about it anyway, so I'm not sure why we had to know about it when we did. The point could have been to introduce Narcissa and use Bellatrix again, but I'm not sure why we care. Or I guess it could have been that we suspect Snape, which would definitely be fun and games, but I'm suspicious of that clearly planted suspicion. My best guess is that we need to know not only THAT Snape made the Unbreakable Vow, but WHAT he vowed to do, and that must have been the most convenient way to do it. Also, I would like to veto love triangles. I know, I know - we have a bunch of 16 year olds of the two genders in constant close quarters, it would be more shocking if we DIDN'T have triangles. But it's woeful to have to read it for a million billion pages. And Ron really can be a spectacular McAsshat when he wants to. (Lavender? Really? I have nothing against her, but really?) Although I worry about where she's going with Ron and Hermione - they FIGHT. A LOT. And I don't think that would change that much, no matter what happens...it hasn't been the \"bickering of unspoken passion\" all this time. I think Ron started the snarking of move around Year 4, but Hermione has been thoroughly...Hermione until this year. Also, I kind of like her with Viktor Krum, because it was FUNNY. Although I am surprisingly myself by being a supporter of Harry-Ginny. I heart Ginny and I think she would work well with him. I mean, if it goes bad it will go VERY VERY BAD, as Harry himself as pointed out, but maybe it won't go bad. Maybe there will be ONE THING in this ENTIRE SERIES that doesn't end up going bad. ....Or she could be the one who dies at the end of book 7 WAH VETO.One disadvantage of being a Johnny (jill?) come lately is that I knew that Dumbledore died, just like I knew that Sirius died, but I managed to block that out with the supreme conviction of someone who believes that the bad ending will have worked itself out by the time she gets there. Unfortunately, it did not, and I am deprived of Dumbledore as I was deprived of Sirius, and yea verily I cried. I cried harder for Sirius than for Dumbledore, though I'm not sure why - probably because why Dumbledore's death wasn't a shock, how it happened was, and I was too busy screaming \"WHAT THE F!\" at the book to really be emotionally wracked. I had to go back and read it twice just to make sure I really understood what had just happened, because it seemed like there was just no way. So the end.....W. T. EEEEEEFFFFFFFF. I mean, what WAS that? Was it an Imperious Curse? Was it the consequences of the Unbreakable Vow? Or have Ron and Harry been right all this time? And it's so utterly bizarre because earlier in the book I'd been thinking about how even though Snape doesn't always like it, in the end he does usually seem to do what's right, like when he made Lupin the serum or when he tried to teach Harry Occlumency-whatever, even though he doesn't like it, and that was what had me convinced that Dumbledore was right in trusting him. And I'd thought that maybe if Harry just sucked it up and apologized to Snape and actually tried being polite it might help - like if he'd had sorry for his accidental disemboweling of Malfoy. I mean, yes, Malfoy was trying to use the Cruciatus on him, but I'd been thinking if Harry just manned up and said to Snape, \"Professor, I'm sorry I did that,\" without making excuses, that might make a different. But then after all of that it turns out that HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS HOWARD CHRIST ON A POGO STICK SNAPE BETRAYED THE POTTERS???? and I seriously rethought that idea.And then...and then after ALL of that, has he really been still working for Voldemort this ENTIRE TIME? I mean, I'd wondered if everyone circling you for all those years going Dumbledore trusts you but we don't and we just want to make that VERY VERY CLEAR could eventually crack you, and then--wha--wha--what? And Dumbledore DIED FOR A FAKE HORCRUX AND WHO THE FUDGE IS R.A.B.?? My brain has just waved a tiny white flag and crawled into the corner to cry. Dear J.K. Rowling: please cease and desist phunking with my heart.Somewhere between a 2.5 and a 3.As I said in my review of The Deathly Hallows, the Harry Potter series has long left me unimpressed.

Perhaps even more so than Percy Jackson, which I rate to be superior to these books because Riordan is much more structurally consistent and in control of his writing. Although Rowling's tone is often wobbly, you can see that she's still managed to build the atmosphere of HP from childish and charming into something more dark and mature--the fact that we sense it, regardless of the technical failings, surely exemplifies that. We grow alongside Harry, having fun with all his adventures as well as encountering all the classic marks of the Hero's Journey--encountering of death, first experiences of grief, that sense of conflict we all feel when we realize that not all is right with the world. The characters, although rather unsubtle, feel real in such a way that the story makes sense, even if the world-building and exposition don't. The predictability of the cliche stereotypes and archetypes Rowling uses for her characters is compensated for by genuine, sympathetic psychological motivations she puts behind them. And the social/political commentary regarding the Ministry of Magic and the hierarchy of Hogwarts is fairly well done, if not completely original. I always got the feeling that Rowling had some important observations to make about the world, but lacked the eloquence to articulate them as effectively as the story demanded.Which brings me to my major problem with this book, and this series as a whole. Rowling is rarely in control of her writing. The prose, although charming and entertaining, has a bit of a hit-and-miss feel with the adverbs and heavy-handed descriptors. And as many people have pointed out, the last-minute plot devices (view spoiler)[Horcruxes (hide spoiler)] are badly foreshadowed--if at all--in the rest of the series, making it feel as if Rowling cares more about her world as a source of cheat tools than a well-developed setting. And besides the more specific failings, there's really not much of a better way I can put it: you can feel Rowling's lack of confidence every step of the story. It's there, not just in the technical components, but also in her authorial voice. In my experience, there is a difference between sensing the presence of the author because the story feels self-assured, and sensing the presence of the author because she's constantly slipping and sliding. Rowling for me falls decidedly into the latter.And I don't really buy the \"it's for children\" argument either. I first read this series when I was twelve, and my general impression has remained unchanged. I had trouble figuring out why HP was so hugely popular because it seemed utterly unremarkable to me at the time, but looking back and rereading this, I think I know why. For all the sloppiness of these stories, the emotional content is extremely well grounded; and it makes sense for Rowling, under all the pressure of millions of fans trying to second-guess her every move, that she would try to attach herself to the characters, and even if she overdid it, the character development is the main redeeming quality of this series. Even the introduction of the (view spoiler)[Horcruxes (hide spoiler)]--a common plot device in fantasy stories--is rather nicely smoothed out because it progresses alongside the character reveals of Horace Slughorn, who is quite a realistic depiction of an adult who has failed to fully confront his conscience. At least Rowling attempts to address her literary weaknesses, although she doesn't succeed in hiding them.I know this review might seem insulting to the hardcore HP fans out there, but trust me: I get it. At least I think I do. Rowling has imagination, she has talent, she has some relevant things to say about the world and she says them in a way that makes it easy for the target audience to draw some valuable things--most specifically the ability to identify with the characters and the struggle of growing up without self-centered justification. Maybe if I was a little less skeptical as a twelve year old I might have been pouring over these books until they fell to pieces in my hands. As it is, however, I will continue to think of HP not as a classic destined to withstand the test of time, but as a semi-successful writing experiment on Rowling's part that managed to spark the imaginations of millions of kids--even if I wasn't one of them.[Horcruxes (hide spoiler)][Horcruxes (hide spoiler)]Este es otro de los libros de la saga para agarrar pa\u00f1uelos.

The plot is dark. Harry is back at Hogwarts and things are supposed to be back to normal but sinister plans are brewing at Hogwarts. Worst summary ever to be honest but shit gets really dark you guys. Everyone knows Voldemort is actually back and people are disappearing left and right or dying or going to jail for things they didn\u2019t do. It slowly but surely starts to affect the students at Hogwarts and everyone is choosing sides. My favorite part about this book was finally figuring out some things about Voldemort and to get some answers about his actions and why he became the way he did. Especially after all the instances where you think he\u2019s finally dead and gone, but he just keeps kicking! It\u2019s nice to finally have some answers even though it wasn\u2019t the most pleasant of discoveries. Honestly, I just want him gone for good. Those last few chapters though completely broke my heart. I was totally devastated over what happened! I knew something bad was gonna happen, I knew things were going to collide in a way that would mean pain and heartache but I did not think that that was going to happen! It\u2019s still insane to me. I haven\u2019t wrapped my head around it completely. Harry has grown up. Like a lot. There\u2019s such a huge contrast between the boy he started out as the man he is becoming now. He\u2019s sad and vulnerable but as determined as always. I love him, I really do and I think he has the biggest heart and the best intentions considering how much pain he\u2019s been through. But he started developing these obsessive tendencies that were annoying. I understand why he acted that way and he was completely right but god, it was just so annoying and frustrating. I just wanted to shake him! I feel really bad saying this but I don\u2019t know what Ron is for. I feel like I don\u2019t know him enough and it\u2019s been six books! He just feels like such a shallow character. I like him; I just don\u2019t feel like I understand who he is or his motivations. Hermoine is my boo but she got a bit annoying for me as well. However, she\u2019s so powerful and smart. Those boys would be lost without her, I promise you. I don\u2019t usually mention this character but I have to say that I felt really bad for Draco in this book. He\u2019s always been a huge pain in the ass and an arrogant little shit head but he\u2019s placed in such a horrible position. He has such high expectations placed on his shoulders and he\u2019s trying so hard to be brave but he\u2019s not ready at all. It broke my heart a little bit. But he\u2019s still an ass.Harry Potter and the half-blood prince is an inspiring and captivating novel . I'd like to share the parts that were most interesting.The novel begins with Snape .

Harry doesn't have a potions book and borrows one from slughorn,which happens to be the property of the Half blood prince. Herein he leaves many new spells and excels in potions.Dumbledore shares memories that shed light upon Voldemort's life and rise to power.Harry notices Dumbledore's blackened hand,(which Dumbledore dismisses when asked),and later discovers that it is due to an Horcrux object.There are few attempts to curse Dumbledore,with the sender unknown.it is quite unfortunate that students become cursed ,rather than the attempts being foiled altogether.Harry began do develop feelings about Ron's sister:Ginny Weasley.Harry discovers Riddle's obsession with Horcruxes in Dumbledore's lessons and is bequeathed to request the memory from slughorn (regarding Horcruxes).Harry than discovers that Malfoy is spending much time in the requirements room,which he eventually used to bring in death eaters.Harry discovers that Voldemort has split his soul by means of Horcruxes.Harry discovers that Snape told Voldemort about the prophecy and led to the murder of his parents.Dumbledore takes Harry with him upon a mission to destroy a horcrux and Dumbledore becomes weakened due to drinking a liquid that would allow them to retrieve the horcrux.Upon their return,they discover that death eaters have entered Hogwarts and that Draco wants to kill Dumbledore.

I felt like smacking sixteen-year-olds doing the teen angst thing - think I got my lifetime's supply from Buffy or something - but I'm sure that's all very realistic; real teenagers make me feel like that too sometimes. Just because its realistic doesn't necessarily make it interesting to read though. The big reveal is fairly obvious, so that you pretty much see it coming from halfway through the book; hmmm... who could the slightly evil expert potion-maker from Hogwarts past be? And Malfoy (gasp!) turns out to be up to no good... now _there's_ a surprise. Actually the whole series is starting to remind me of the X-files, with Harry playing the part of young Mulder in a dress. First, Harry/Mulder acquires a tiny scrap of inconclusive evidence and builds an incredibly complex conspiracy theory on it which ends up blaming his enemies. Everyone around him fails to believe him because his evidence is scanty and hes obviously biased, but in the end, he turns out to be right anyways. The moral of the story is apparently that you should persecute people you don't like mercilessly regardless of fact, because in the end they will turn out to be behind whatever might be going wrong in your life. And meanwhile, after the 5th or 6th time its happened, you want to scream at Ron/Hermione/Scully to just BELIEVE him instead of being reasonable because facts or no facts is he EVER wrong? Dumbledore dying was very sad, but Harry breaking up with Ginny to keep her safe had no emotional impact, since he does it in such a condescending way - never even asks her opinion - and we'd barely seen them together in any case.The first ones were aimed at kids but appealed to all of us because we all, deep-down, still like to think we're a bit of a kid. These ones are aimed at teenagers. Who wants to be a teenager again?I still have no idea why most people love this book. It read like a 13 year old fanfiction writer teeny-bopper wrote it. The only redeeming parts were the very beginning and ending parts with Snape. Snape was well handled, that was about it. OotP ended with a GREAT setup for book 6 but instead we get a really bad, trivial teen romance storyline. Yes, I think OotP was great, and most people hate it, I have no idea what other readers are thinking! Let's see.

Yes, I think OotP was great, and most people hate it, I have no idea what other readers are thinking! Let's see. Tom is... dum dum dum... just an EVIL KID. Really? Way to give him motivation. With the prejudices of the magical community, Tom could have been given so many motivations beyond just being the wizard equivalent of Demian. I was expecting so much more. The Horcrux adventures were dull... I didn't realize this was an RPG. There was a severe lack of any interesting adult character scenes... this was why I loved OotP so much. The Order was interesting and captivating. PoA pulled me into the series because of the adult backstory it presented... the adults are far more interesting than the kids when they are presented properly. Hermoine being a mopey puppy in love. Ron just making out constantly. DRACO CRYING IN BATHROOMS!? Draco doesn't feel sympathy for others... if anything he'd only be worried about failing at his mission, and that wouldn't cause tears. He's a self-serving weasel, he would only worry about his own interests. This was maybe the only time Rowling tried to give character growth to a child character in this novel and she failed miserably at it. The end of book 6 was miserable. Tonks and Remus are essentially destroyed as interesting characters. I literally threw the book at the love confession. It was so tacked on, so poorly handled, so UNNECESSARY. Most of this book was unnecessary. The franchise ended with OotP for me. I don't know why poor writing isn't more easily recognized. I guess people hold a blind eye towards anything negative associated with this series.Um wow. What else can be said? I can waste time reviewing or move on to book 7. Think I will move on. If you want a great series, read these. If you want to be a better writer, read these. Just do it already!I just wrote a full review for this book and then Goodreads did something weird and I lost it all. I'm too lazy to try to rewrite it word for word so you can have a list instead.1. I miss some of the whimsy and newness that we had in the first four books. Everything is getting darker and more morbid and there is so much more at risk. I love this, of course, but I wish there could have been more moments of fun and more snippets of education apart from those that are directly related to the storylI just wrote a full review for this book and then Goodreads did something weird and I lost it all.

Ginny and Harry's relationship did not seem organic to me. Hermione and Ron have been built up throughout all of the books, but Harry's feelings of jealousy and desire just showed up. Their kiss and relationship did not have me convinced as to any feelings between the two.3. Book!Ginny continues to be great. Fred and George are my favorites. Neville... what a sweetheart. The side characters are so important to me. Luna!!! I adore them.4. Snape continues to be nothing but trash to me. I will never be convinced that Snape was ever anything but a bully, a murderer, an all-around bad egg. I mean, I could feel a little bad when James was being a jerk to him while they were at school, but, really??? He has become nothing but evil. UGH.5. Some parts were just too long. The Pensieve magic was interesting and those memories were important, but I think something in the execution was lacking. I wasn't as captured by those scenes as I wanted to be.This series continues to be amazing, but these later books just don't touch the greatness that is books 3 and 4 for me.WARNING: All the spoilers!

But let's end this review on a more positive note:    ***SPOILER ALERT***This book was really amazing it even made me cry.

I think even if I know a lot of what was going to happen I still find it painful to read it especially the part when Dumbledore was killed and Hagrid was talking to Harry and Hagrid doesn't know at that moment that Dumbledore was already dead. It was really painful for me and i cried at that point because it was like suddenly the most person that you think the greatest of them all and actually the one wizard that Voldemort feared was dead. To think that Snape killed him and that the horcrux was fake i feel really terrible that it all ended that way. I think that this ending was more depressing than when Sirius Black was killed on the Order of the Phoenix. There were so many questions that really need answers. That would make you after reading this book think, be nervous about what would possibly happen.I really felt that this was a good book and hope that the movie would not disappoint me. I saw a trailer of it wherein the burrow was burned it's not in the book though. I can't wait to buy \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows.\" Really Harry Potter series made me hooked that i truly recommended everyone to read this book. Book six brought my slowly budding love for Mr. Snape to a head. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I am all about the good guy winning and I am totally rooting for the main character to find his prize at the bottom of the 80\u2019s cereal box. BUT it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t be crushing on a little side action while things are reaching their boiling point. Apparently this girl has a soft spot for the tall, dark and greasy type.

How will I feel if I\u2019m wrong? He will still hold a place in my favorite character category because there is just so much to him as a character. He is honestly one that I would love to hear more of a backstory on (fingers crossed the next book covers that).So a lot has happened here and I am ready to face everyone\u2019s fate (as horrible as it might be) in the final installment of this epic series.

What happened at the end of Order of the Phoenix brought with it a promise of global change and it's almost palpable now. There is no safe place anymore, Harry can trust very few people and even some of those he trusted to be friends still refuse to believe what he says about Voldemort, even though there could not be clearer evidence of his return. Nonetheless, I absolutely enjoyed this book from start to finish; I love how Rowling changed the whole pattern of the books from \"summer time; Hogwarts; problems; adventures\" to a real quest to defeat Voldemort.Differently from previous books, on this one nothing of particular impact happens to Harry before the new semester at Hogwarts begins. The only significant event that I can recall is Dumbledore using him as a human magnet to attract a new, supposedly, Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. So we are introduced to Slughorn, which I liked from minute one. In my opinion, he is one of the most believable characters that Rowling ever created. Most of the wizards (not considering Harry, his friends and the majority of the Weasleys) display a certain stoic behavior; some of them, like professor McGonagall, for instance, don't even express much emotion during the entire series. Slughorn, on the other hand, is a Russian roulette of conflicting emotions since his introduction. He feels proud of most of his acquaintances, ashamed of some, afraid of others. He feels attracted to the opportunity of being a teacher which would allow him to meet even more talented people, but afraid of what impact the exposure as a teacher would make in his life now that the world of wizards is being set upside down.Well, after this events, Harry is sent to the Weasleys', where nothing really meaningful happens. Then we have the customary travel to Hogwarts, where some enmities are reinforced, we might say. I must say that the atmosphere at school is utterly different from any of the other books. Some students didn't even return to school, so afraid they were, which I don't quite remember happening before, even when the Chamber of Secrets had been reopened on book two.As soon as the semester starts, Dumbledore starts inviting Harry to private conversations at his office, so we start to realize what this book is really about: send normal school affairs to the dumps, let's investigate Voldemort's past so we might come up with some way to defeat him. I found it great how Rowling added rebellious teenager behavior to back up Harry not caring much about school anymore, focusing on his new found mission. It added a much more believable sense to the character and to the whole story itself. Anyway, during the whole book we get to know, through collected memories of people who interacted with Voldemort during some points of his existence, a lot of unimaginable and priceless information which helps us understand what drove him to become what he is now: a monster.Setting Harry's mission apart for an instant, I would like to mention how fun some parts of this book were, due to the tinge of \"sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll\" that Rowling displayed. There are constant love conflicts, hormones are exploding everywhere; even Hermione, which I could never guess cared much about people, was found crying in the corners, feeling alone and betrayed. Again, giving young wizards a little bit of \"muggle\" adolescence hell was very well done in the sense that it makes the story much more believable.As the story goes on, Dumbledore and Harry get closer and closer to uncovering Voldemort's deepest secret, which leads them to go outside Hogwarts in search of evidence. Unfortunately, the results of their little adventure are disastrous. Getting advantage over Dumbledore's momentary absence from Hogwarts, the dark forces find their way into the castle and things get really bad. Rowling is not afraid anymore, so the signs of her advanced \"George R. R. Martin syndrome\" are firmly displayed, which makes me take a star out of this book. The ending is bitter and sad, setting a clear path to what we can expect on the final book.  Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review:  It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.  Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right."},

All of the overarching plot lines: the romances between Harry and Ginny and Ron and Hermione, the disappearance of Dumbledore, the continuing evolution of the prophecy, etc. came together to create a captivating story full of twists and fresh, likeable characters. While this one and the seventh book are tied in terms of being my favorite, if I had to choose one book that really captured the essence of Harry Potter, I'd probably pick this one.My favorite moments revolved around Ron and Hermione. I loved their mutual jealousy and affection and how neither of them succumbed to insta-love. Overall I would recommend this to any fans who enjoyed books 1-4; the quality of this installment makes the hot mess that was the fifth book a distant memory."},

I'd gotten into the Harry Potter phenomenon late, after the 5th book was out, and during the time before Half-Blood Prince was out, I'd read and re-read the first 5 books... A LOT. So then comes the 6th book's release, and by this time, I'm just as rabid for it as everyone else. I need to know what's happened. I need to know whether Sirius... but no. What I really need to know is What Will Harry Do Now? The day comes, and, at the time, I was working a late shift. I got out of work at 11:15pm, raced to the bookstore for the midnight release... and found it closed, dark, and the parking lot nearly empty when I got there at 11:30. OH! I was LIVID. I immediately, literally standing in the parking lot, called the bookstore and ripped the manager a new one. The book releases at MIDNIGHT. I HAD A PRE-ORDER!! You don't get to sell it early just because you don't feel like being there into the early hours of the morning! I was so angry that Mr. Sheepishly Apologetic Bookstore Manager even offered to reopen the store for me. I refused on principle. (What? He made me mad and I just wanted him to know it. Though, honestly, if I was really feeling vindictive, I should have made him re-openThe summumabeech.)What does this story have to do with anything? Nothing much, except to establish my almost desperate frame of mind... I NEEDED that book. But I knew they'd be available everywhere. That night, there were so many copies of Half-Blood Prince around that I could practically have snagged one off of a passing owl. And just as an aside, I'll tell you that when the 7th book came out a couple years later, that bookstore was open and selling them properly. I take personal credit. Not that I was there... I went to a different store, again on principle. Because I hold grudges like that. ;)Anyway, with my new acquisition, I raced home, told my boyfriend he had to go out with his friends so that he didn't disturb me, and I devoured the book in hours. And it was like... a cool drink of water after you've been thirsty for a long time. I HAD A NEW HARRY POTTER BOOK! But after finishing, I was like, \"Eh, it's just a filler, bridge to the last book, book.\" I wasn't disappointed - don't get me wrong. I had loved it. But I am admitting that it took me a couple reads to really, REALLY appreciate it properly. All the things that we learn, all the ways that this book brings all the things that we'd seen in the first 5 books together, how Harry finally realizes what it all means and what he'll have to do, how he can't just hope to keep defending himself and those he loves, but knows he'll need to go on the offensive if he hopes to win... It was all amazing, brilliantly woven together into this awesome next-to-last book. When Harry tells Ron and Hermione about the real prophecy, and he is grateful to them for not shrinking away from him as though he'd suddenly turned leprous, it hits home just how alone Harry truly is. I never expected them to do differently... but Harry feared they might. It shows how much of a complex Harry has about his role in everything - he's always been alone, separate, so it surprises him that his friends would stick by him. And even at the very end, he is again surprised when they refuse to let him shrug them off and take the Horcrux Hunt onto his own shoulders completely. Harry. Harry... You have better friends than you can possibly know. What I wouldn't give for friends that would stand with me like that, time after time after time, and in the face of such danger and fear. Silly boy. I also love Snape in this book. He's as much of a jerk as always, but in the chapter where he's running from Hogwarts, when he screams at Harry not to call him a coward, how his voice is described, how he's STILL trying to teach Harry, but Harry is too full of blind rage to hear, to think, to learn... It's... brilliant. Harry reaches his conclusions and refuses to see any other alternative, despite what Dumbledore has exemplified year after year - openmindedness, trust, understanding. Damn, I love this book. Just amazing. "},

It's true! Yes, this might've been influenced by the fact that I heard so much bad stuff about him, but I never outright heard that he was an actual fully-fledged Death Eater. (Which, by the way, makes about 0 sense in my opinion. \"Death Eater?\" Like, you consume death? You obtain energy from death? That last one might be it, but still. Very strange moniker.) Anyway, yeah, back to Snape. Even though in book 5, when Harry started taking the Occlumency lessons with Snape, we all - and again I just mean I - hoped that Snape would bond with Harry???? Because he was supposedly on the good side???? And that would be super cute to be honest???? But deep down, or at least once Snape didn't forgive Harry for finding that memory, we concluded he was evil through and through. You can probably tell that I was super annoyed that no one believed Harry when he suspected Snape and Draco of being Death Eaters, even though it was super obvious. I feel like in this book, the doubt everyone had of Harry's ideas was less realistic because they were pretty accurate, but that's just my opinion. (Throwback to my Book 2 review when I said I liked Snape and Draco, hah! How naive I was back then, a few weeks ago.)I liked the idea of the Horocruxes, and I feel like, had that theory been introduced earlier on, the entire series could have been centered around them. I guess in a way, it was. But it is an interesting concept and it adds a lot more of the expected mystery aspect of the Harry Potter Books. As a big romance-lover, the last 5 books were okay, but I wasn't as fulfilled as would've been had there been more romance/drama. (That's actually kind of a lie because they were just as if not more engaging than the stuff I usually read - but that's a given. I just needed a good intro.) Nevertheless, I enjoyed this book fractionally better because of the romance and drama added. Ron and Hermione and all their drama was super funny and cute. And Harry and Ginny I've been rooting for since Book 1, too (never mind that I had outside influence on that as well). Hope to see Harry and Ginny back together by the end of the series.Back to what I said at the beginning, I am pretty pissed that JK Rowling killed off Dumbledore, yet another of my favorite characters. It seems that I just seen someone my favorite and she makes it a priority to kill them - even though these books were published like ten years ago. First Sirius, now Dumbledore, who's next - Hagrid? WAIT, forget I said that. (Ew that was so cheesy and forced.) Dear JK, please don't kill anyone else I love, thanks! I'm pretty apprehensive of the next book, as can be expected, but I've actually heard that there's going to be an eighth book. Who it's about I have yet to know since I haven't finished the seventh, but I'm pretty excited anyway."},

There's no reason for one, though; at this point, Rowling could sell the phone book under the title Harry Potter and the Unlisted Number and it would probably sell millions. As for The Half-Blood Prince, 300 pages could easily be removed from its text without anybody - the author included - noticing."},

The Half-Blood Prince was easily the best book in the series up to this point. It kept me riveted. This book is right up there among the best fantasy I've ever read. Rowling has finally earned a place in my mind among the best fantasy writers. I know, I came to that realization kind-of late, but this was the first book of hers that really blew me away. It was fascinating to see the scope of the story expand and long-time mysteries be illuminated. In any great fictional story, the scope of the story expands as the story arc progresses. That was definitely the case with this book. The scope of the story expanded, and your knowledge of what's going on greatly increased. Everything that happened up to this point is seen in a larger context. Now that the Ministry is convinced that Voldemort is back, the real war against Voldemort has begun. People are dying every day. Has Snape betrayed the Order of the Phoenix? The book gets off to a suspenseful start. Then Dumbledore decides to give Harry private lessons, and each lesson is fascinating as they use the pensieve to explore memories of different people to try to figure out Voldemort's origins, motives, and plans. Dumbledore gives Harry an assignment to collect a memory from Professor Slughorn, one of the new teachers on the staff, that holds the key to understanding Voldemort's plans. Harry obtains the memory, and from that point forward I could not put the book down. Each chapter from that point on was riveting. Each one contained incredible, amazing events that expanded the scope of the story arc and expanded your understanding of what was happening. The chapter on on 'horcruxes' in particular blew me away. Finally we know how Voldemort achieved immortality! Now it was clear what had to be done to defeat him! It changed everything. That chapter defined the course of the rest of the series. Later, Dumbledore took Harry on a mission to destroy one of the horcruxes, and the account of that excursion was brilliant. I was totally riveted. It was so descriptive, so suspenseful. Upon their return to Hogwarts, they discovered that the school had been infiltrated by Death Eaters, and a full-blown battle erupted. Again, it was so suspenseful, I could not put the book down. Somehow I knew that Dumbledore had to die. Harry had been under Dumbledore's tutelage and protection throughout the whole series. I could see why Dumbledore dying was necessary for Potter's further growth and development. It sets things up so that Potter will have to face Voldemort one last time in the last book, alone. It had to be that way. One thing worries me though. Is Harry ready? After all, he hasn't completed his education and training. Harry was no match for Snape in their duel at the end of Half-Blood Prince. He still has a lot to learn. How can he ever track down and destroy 4 horcruxes, and then destroy Voldemort, all by himself? This is by-far the largest task he's ever had to face, and seems too much for him. Well, we'll just have to see, shall we?P.S.: Am I the only one that has a reasonable guess as to who R.A.B. stands for? Without having read Deathly Hollows yet or knowing anything about how things actually turn out, I think I have it figured out. Think about it: Who in the entire series do we know with a last name that begins with a B? Well of course, there's the Black family. Now there are lots of Blacks, but who among the Blacks has a first name beginning with an R, who opposed Voldemort? Of course! Sirius's brother Regulus! Who else could it possibly be? Regulus stole the horcrux, and soon after Voldemort killed him. It all makes sense. Why hasn't anybody else figured it out? Remember, this is just a theory. I haven't read Deathly Hallows and I know nothing about how things actually turn out. I'll have to read on and see if I'm right."},

Prover\u00f2, dunque, ad articolare maggiormente i motivi che mi hanno portato ad apprezzare cos\u00ec tanto questo titolo, sia all'interno della serie che come opera singola.Innanzitutto, la linea narrativa \u00e8 molto interessante e l'alternarsi di una quotidianit\u00e0 cupa e fatta di normali problematiche adolescenziali (la scuola, le prime cotte e gli amori non corrisposti, le relazioni con compagni e professori, la popolarit\u00e0, tutto filtrato dalla lente della situazione difficoltosa che si vive a livello generale) e dei flashback, delle porzioni di storia dedicate alla narrazione del passato di Voldemort, sempre curioso ed interessante, che si mescola sapientemente con il resto della storia ed aggiunge uno spessore consistente alla trama. I personaggi crescono notevolmente durante tutto l'arco narrativo, complici sia i grandi eventi drammatici che hanno vissuto precedentemente e che ancora caratterizzano le loro esistenze, ma anche le semplici tappe che qualsiasi adolescente ha affrontato in quello stesso periodo della sua vita. Il rapporto fra i personaggi si fa pi\u00f9 complesso e sfaccettato, impariamo a conoscere maggiormente alcune figure che erano rimaste in ombra ed in generale alunni e professori di Hogwarts acquisiscono ancor pi\u00f9 tridimensionalit\u00e0 e spessore. Come dicevo, le porzioni di storia dedicate allo studio del passato di Voldemort sono interessantissime, un espediente molto intelligente per andare a conoscere un personaggio cos\u00ec importante ed allo stesso tempo impostare quelle che saranno importanti rivelazioni per il proseguimento delle vicende. Il rapporto fra Harry Potter e Silente, poi, viene sapientemente tratteggiato durante queste lezioni, aggiungendo un ulteriore elemento di coinvolgimento per il lettore, ancor pi\u00f9 coinvolto dal presente e dal passato delle vicende. L'atmosfera \u00e8 molto pi\u00f9 matura e cupa rispetto ai capitoli precedenti, si percepisce la tensione, il senso d'ansia e di difficolt\u00e0 del momento, ma rimane comunque presente il senso di casa, di domesticit\u00e0 che si respira ogni volta che si torna ad Hogwarts, circondandosi di personaggi e luoghi conosciuti. Anche lo stile, pur migliorando nettamente, rimane sempre riconoscibile, semplice, scorrevole, ma capace di profondit\u00e0 e complessit\u00e0 quando necessario. Questi sono solamente alcuni punti che mi vengono in mente nell'analisi di quest'opera, ma gli elementi che la rendono ricca e godibile sono anche altri la crescita del personaggio di Draco Malfoy e la sua relazione con Severus Piton, il rapporto fra Ron ed Hermione, il Lumaclub e tutti i momenti ad esso correlati, la storia del Principe Mezzosangue, giusto per fare qualche esempio. Un'opera ben scritta, dunque, che approfondisce tutte le tematiche classiche della serie, aggiungendo innumerevoli elementi d'interesse e maggiore complessit\u00e0, un sesto libro che si inserisce perfettamente nel contesto della saga ed allo stesso tempo prepara l'atmosfera per il gran finale. C'\u00e8 tutto ci\u00f2 che si pu\u00f2 cercare in un libro fantasy per ragazzi, dal divertimento alla tensione, dai colpi di scena alle rivelazioni pi\u00f9 sconvolgenti, sempre con il giusto tocco di magia, leggerezza, atmosfera tipica e riconoscibile che ha reso questi libri universalmente amati ed apprezzati.

We are seeing the plot coming together much more and, of course, we have the ultimate plot device that will take us right to the end now. However, it still felt... just a bit meh.Harry and Ron have still not changed (excepting the hormones) and I find that rather annoying. They've been the same kind of stupid-brave, semi-intelligent boys throughout and it seems only external things have changed with them. Whilst Hermione has altered pretty much every book, in this one I found her quite irritating, though I can't quite put my finger on why. There seemed a small shift just in the way she was and spoke. Perhaps that was hormones, too. Whilst we did get a lot more of Dumbledore here (which I think was long overdue) he didn't seem as well-developed as he could have been. The other characters were, again, purely background and just there to fill an otherwise empty space.It was faster paced than the previous books have been, yet the smallness of the world kind of means that everything takes place right here and right now, which contributes to propelling the story forward more than the writing did. I thought it carried well from the previous book better than the others did (it always felt like an abrupt ending preceded an abrupt beginning) and I think that is a reflection of the way the plot has surpassed the idea of them being individual books and instead a whole, full series.Usually I am not bothered about spoilers, and since I've read these before, seen the film and looked at a thousand Tumblr posts about them, there's no getting away from knowing what happens. However, when I do read with a previous knowledge to a book, I always find that the writing still holds a surprise for me: not in this case. I didn't see any surprises anywhere at all and that was very disappointing."},

(I mean, it's kinda obvious Harry is totally crushing on Malfoy, but whatevs)However, I don't really think this book is about Harry. Of course he's the main character, but I really think this book is about Dumbledore and Voldemort. In Phoenix, it became clear that Dumbledore is not a wholesomely good man. His biggest fault probably being his willingness to forget that Harry is just a child and throwing him into his role as a chosen hero. And it's explored more here. The situation is less dangerous, but the stakes are just as high. Dumbledore is totally willing to use Harry to achieve an end. Not that I'm saying Dumbledore isn't a good person, he certainly is. But when I was a child he was the ultimate good, who could do no wrong, and with this book, it becomes more clear that he, like most people, isn't totally and completely good. He protects the ones he loves, but he's willing to use Harry as less of a person, and more as a means to an end. And important end no doubt, but he seems to forget that Harry is just a teenager.And then we get the opportunity to explore Voldemort's past, which I found incredibly interesting. It was intriguing to see the transformation he goes through again, and to see the path he walks that leads him to becoming the Dark Lord we know. And the stuff with Draco is great as well, and with context from the entire series, I find myself really able to sympathize with the poor kid. He just wants to protect his family, and I just feel so bad for him. I wanna give him a hug and tell him everything's gonna be okay.Really, this just gets me more excited to reread The Deathly Hallows, though I'm not sure I'm prepared for the body count that book will leave behind. I need to reread it soon so I can reread the entire series again in December."},

It made him more human in a way, or rather less of a god-like figure.We still have plenty of humour, thankfully, such as the scene with the Muggle Prime Minister or life at Hogwarts, to give us moments of laughter to break the tension. Additionally, for a novel focusing more and more on the battle against evil, much emphasis is put on feelings, such as filial love, teenage infatuation, real (and false) love, friendship, courage, redemption, etc. Rowling is echoing Dumbledore\u2019s belief in the power of the heart.Theories on the structure of the series abound but I do like the one that proposes that all 7 books can be folded at book 4, making Prisoner of Azkaban joined with Order of the Phoenix, and indeed Chamber of Secrets with the Half-Blood Prince. There are many parallels, such as Tom Riddle\u2019s diary and the Potions coursebook, Ginny, Parseltongue, etc. And more can indeed be seen in book 1 and 7.There is also a kind of expectant feeling cursing through the whole novel, just under the surface - a preparation for the real events, as indeed it is. This is the only book in the series that does not have a real ending, but sets up the Quest for the final instalment. Usually this would weaken the story but that is not the case in this instance. On the contrary, it resonates strongly, even more so in this re-reading."},

He\u2019s not too grumpy like I think he was in the previous book, but I don\u2019t really like something about him in this book. I especially despise his suspicious of Snape and Malfoy. He seemed so determined to think Snape and Malfoy were bad even though all evidence said otherwise. His suspicion was only based on dislike and I have to say (Harry Potter fans please don\u2019t hate me) that it was pretty low. But Harry also showed his best quality here too. His love and selflessness toward his friends is wonderful. But I think he ought to listen to Hermione more.

AHHHHHHH.Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was fantastic, as expected! There wasn't as much action in this book as there was in previous books (until the very end) BUT J.K Rowling definitely made up for that with the character development which was needed, especially for characters we knew little about, like Voldemort. Harry is no longer spending his time feeling down but moving on from his previous year at Hogwarts, growing up and dealing with his situation that little bit more in an adult way. He's feeling much better in himself, more accepted by his friends/teachers. But the rage and fear still continues in Harry throughout this book, determined to get through this wreck. Voldemort's history was written in so so SO well, using the pensive for this was genius. Here we saw how Tom Riddle came to become Lord Voldemort. His character development was greatly needed. I thoroughly enjoyed Dumbledore's lessons. This book also has my most favorite chapter in the series so far. 'The cave' chapter was so different and refreshing, Harry and Dumbledore having an adventure together? And outside Hogwarts grounds too? It was awesome! The events of this chapter was described so well. Dumbledore drinking the potion and going through alllll that pain was heartbreaking, also the Inferi were absolutely terrifying!!!Okay, so. It is really hard for me to talk about this book without dropping spoilers. Half Blood Prince was full of shocks!! So SPOILER ALERT!!! I have to mention Dumbledore's death. Even though I knew this was going to happen, and I saw the movies it still saddened me! Dumbledore was so great in this book, he made loads of appearances which really makes a difference to The Order Of The Phoenix where we had little to no scenes with him. The funeral was just so depressing. UGHHH! :(I was a tiny bit sceptical about Harry and Ginnys relationship at first but I really do enjoy them together, the same as Ron and Hermione (although not officially together) they are just adorable, all the jealousy was both cute and hilarious to read! I can't wait to read on and watch all the characters relationships flourish.Now something I was really shocked by. I found myself feeling so sorry for Draco. He was raised to believe he was superior to everyone else from a young age so he doesn't really know much better i guess. He hasn't really had the chance to think for himself to become either good or bad because of his parents/voldemort expected so much. I believe he was driven to be the way he is now by fear his whole life. Sirius wasn't a coward so he was able to stand up to what he believed in with his family being the way they were, whereas I feel like Draco is too much of a coward break free from it all. I still think that he's an evil piece of work but I can't help but feeling some sympathy. Also I really don't think he would have killed Dumbledore.Overall, I loved The Half-Blood Prince so surprise surprise I give it a 5/5 :) :) "},

My sister, Melissa, likes baseball in an unnatural obsessive fashion (much the way I like TV) and got us tickets to the game. Naturally this concerned me due to the midnight release part of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which I was supposed to be attending that night. (Bear with me, this story does eventually relate to Half-Blood Prince.)So it's like the bottom of the 8th inning and we're losing and I'm really worried at this point that we're going to be late so I make my entire family get up and leave. My sister put up a little bit of a fight, but as we were losing by at least three runs, she eventually shut up and we left. But as we were walking back to the car, the stadium EXPLODED. And kept exploding. Fireworks went off (not a euphemism). And my sister turned to me and knifed my bowels into ribbons with just the power of her angry eyes. I tried to explain to her that you don't fuck around with Harry Potter, but not five minutes later when we'd reached the car and turned on the radio and she learned that we'd won that 12th consecutive game and that we'd been there and left, I really thought she might murder me. She hadn't read Harry Potter yet, you see. She didn't understand.Fast forward two years. She was right there with me at the midnight release of Half-Blood Prince, dressed as Draco Malfoy. We raced home together and read the book late into the night, waking up early to finish. I finished first and she was mad when I started crying and she had to wait to find out why. And of course, later in the shower, when I remembered what happened and started crying AGAIN (is there anything more pathetic than crying in the shower over a dead fictional character?), after I got out she couldn't resist making fun of me. Apparently I'd been crying so loud that she'd heard the sobs through the walls and over the sound of the running water. But FUCK, man! That shit is sad! Served her right ten minutes later when it was her turn to cry.But anyway, the point is that none of you should be in doubt: Harry Potter is way more important than baseball. And football.

It might surprise some reading this that I was tempted to give this book five stars for pure enjoyment, but objectively I do not believe it was quite as good as many other five star novels. The story in this novel should be familiar to anyone with any knowledge of popular culture (that of Harry Potter, the boy wizard who must fight and defeat the dark lord Voldemort). Indeed, there has been an entire subculture of pop culture (akin to other franchises like Marvel, DC, Game of Thrones, Doctor Who etc) which has developed alongside these books, and initially made me very skeptical of the series. I was particularly skeptical with the first three books (the third book improved on the first two admittedly) with the poorly defined magic systems, the childish characters, the writing that was still quite rough-around-the-edges and actually only was attracted to the worldbuilding and the overall charm of the novels. However, as Rowling has continued to write her quality of plotting, character-development and worldbuilding has also improved. In short her novels have transformed into typical children's fiction and become something more worthwhile.Let me explain why these books become more worthwhile. For instance, the first few novels were so singularly focused on the schooling at Hogwarts that any reference to the overall villains seemed like some cheap side-story. However, this novel (and the previous two) adopt more mature tones and a clearer focus on where the entire story is headed. The novels also reveal heightened levels of political subtext and references to how education systems and government systems are run (forming a kind of fascinating analysis of real life despite featuring a magical world - something more fantasy books should undertake). Character building further improves. These books are perhaps, the most famous coming-of-age stories in the world at the moment, and they are with the overall character development, prime examples of this. Harry, though involved in helping the adult world, must deal with the pressures of being treated like a child - albeit a special child - and these later novels expose these pressures with writing full of emotion, charm and greater wit. It's somewhat manipulative of Rowling, but her novels are written in a way that the expected audience can grow alongside the characters and find that they themselves can identify strongly with what the characters feel. Children and teenagers certainly understand what it is to feel special, powerless, weak, inadequate, intelligent and awkward. These are emotions that Rowling exposes and uses in useful ways as a writer.Admittedly, as fantasy books these are far from the greatest examples. They are nice children's novels - although I place far greater importance on The Chronicles of Narnia, Alice in Wonderland, The Hobbit and gems like Little House in the Woods or Little Women. And this importance is only because those were novels which defined part of my childhood reading experience (add in some Roald Dahl or other classics of course). I almost forgot to mention the prose itself. It's a nice, charming style which Rowling has fine-tuned by the time of this book: casual enough, simple, but with nuance and sophistication hidden in the word-choices it's certainly a very sympathetic type of writing and one suitable for her audience. I would state that the best and most recognizable technique of Rowling's is her use of foreshadowing and asides together. Some of her foreshadowing is very neat and clever and though some of it in the earlier books is very obvious, by the stage of this book it is reached a stage where it becomes more intriguing rather than apparent.As for the plot of this book, well it focuses on the terror that the return of Voldemort has brought to the wizarding world and the discovery of an important textbook owned by a mysterious Half-Blood Prince (a textbook which provides all kinds of secret tips for Harry in his potions class). The interesting Snape and the fatherly Dumbledore have greater roles again in this novel and the resolution leads to something of a cliff-hanger (but not quite). In short it's an interesting novel where the 'devil is in the details' as they say.To me I think that a lot of the reputation of these novels is undeserved. They are nice books and certainly enjoyable (much like Hunger Games or Divergent is to me) and I appreciate that they lead a lot of children into the greater world of reading. I also feel that the whole 'evil books' side of the reputation (with some parents not allowing their children to read them) is also undeserved. There are some great themes and lessons in here - although I dislike the harsh punishments handed out by teachers and the casual use of hexes and curses in the books at times. The biggest draw is, of course, the wizarding world and the idea of having a school for wizards which I don't think is something seen in western literature in this way. Either way, I certainly am enjoying reading these books like I enjoy the other books. They're mostly unique, charming and get better as they continue. "},

Second read. Spoilers EVERYWHERE.Unlike the other mega-large Harry Potter books (aka 4, 5, and 7), I ended up liking Half-Blood Prince a little less the second time around. The full-steam-ahead feeling that characterized Books 4 and 5 seemed to lose a little bit of momentum here. If Order of the Phoenix is the book where things get real in the Harry Potter world, then Half-Blood Prince is a quieter book, the moment when Rowling is really planning for the ending, building the story and background for the last part of the story and the inevitable battle between Voldemort and Harry. On my first read of Half-Blood Prince, I was enthralled by the backstory. Finally, after years, we were getting to the \"heart\" of Voldemort and how he became the way he is. Only by understanding him could Harry beat him. On my second read, though, I felt like the book dragged a bit - Voldemort doesn't even really play a role in the battle at the end - and even though the actions that happen in this book are necessary to get us to book 7, it really didn't feel like a big payoff in the end. I was desperate to get to certain moments in the book the second time around - I wanted Harry to get the damn memory from Slughorn immediately, I wanted to get to the moment where Harry and Dumbledore discuss choices, I wanted to see the cave again, and even though it hurt, I wanted to re-read that moment when Snape kills Dumbledore. Because there were so many important bits of backstory, and a lot of them occur at the end of the book, my second read was characterized by a bit more impatience, especially with the Malfoy subplot, which I found to be a bit of a retread of book 5, in that Harry believes something that no one else does.What IS interesting is how much more pronounced that obsession with catching Malfoy was to me on this second read. I feel like that obsession is a bit of a foreshadowing for Harry's obsession with the Deathly Hallows in book seven, and also shows Harry's stubborn belief in his own ideas without basis and the way he rushes into action (also characterized by his disastrous attempts at Occlumency and his constant dreams about the Department of Mysteries in book 5). While it's good to stand up for your beliefs, I think the stubbornness makes Harry reckless, a lot like Sirius, and it makes Harry's choices of Hallows vs. Horcruxes that much smarter in book 7. Harry continues to be a very angsty teenager - with good reason, but nevertheless, there's a lot of anger and resentment at his predicament. This was the first time in reading where I felt like I wouldn't necessarily want to be Harry's friend - he's a bit scary in his anger. That said, I still very much enjoyed seeing the advanced magic in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's NEWT classes, the Quidditch games, and yes, the romance. Half-Blood Prince is definitely the book of teenage hormones, where Ron finally realizes that girls exist, and thus spends quite a lot of time making out with Lavender Brown before realizing that he might actually like someone else a bit more. Meanwhile, Harry's realization that Ginny exists as a girl and not just his best friend's sister was so satisfying, even the second time around. Because Ginny is my favourite character, I was grateful that we got so much more of her in this book, and got to see how, unlike Harry's \"relationship\" with Cho, which was really based on her looks, Harry and Ginny already had a rapport, they've known each other for a long time, and his feelings grew naturally out of his gradual knowledge of her as a smart, funny, talented, and headstrong girl who isn't afraid to fight back. Even the scenes when they're together are so different from Harry's date with Cho, where he was stuck in Madam Puddifoot's - right after Harry and Ginny get together, they're sitting casually in the Gryffindor common room laughing with Ron and Hermione. It's clear that this is a relationship that is real. It's not a perfect read, but nevertheless, the second time around, the scenes at the end of the book with Harry and Dumbledore still made me cry. I knew the first time around that Dumbledore would have to die - there's a reason why that cliche about the old mentor dying before the hero can move on exists - but even knowing all that did not stop me from feeling the poignancy of the funeral, of Harry and Ginny's break-up, and the moment when Hermione and Ron step up and insist on going with Harry on his mission.

While the adventure with Dumbledore at the end is exciting and intriguing, and the Battle is terrifying and heart-pounding, I don't think it lives up to the previous books. Not that it isn't interesting, and the end isn't heartbreaking, but overall, the plot falls a little flat for me. Mind you, my eyes are still red and puffy from all the crying.Let it be said, however, and despite my personal feelings about the pairing, book Ginny Weasley is so much better than movie Ginny. She has spunk and is a nice counter to Hermione's intellect and brains-first attitude. Ginny is popular and pretty and dates around, and doesn't let her brothers give her crap for it! And there's something to be said of that. She holds her own with Harry and his friends, and with Fred and George, when she needs to, and that's so much cooler than the movie Ginny who has no personality.That being said, I'm not a Harry-Ginny fan. To me, it feels rushed (look at the Ron-Hermione, 7 book long setup!), and Ginny seems to be too much of a replacement for his mother. He doesn't notice her for years, and then all of a sudden his \"monster\" is upset she's kissing Dean? I just don't buy it. I also feel like Harry needs someone outside the realm of his group of friends, if anyone at all. Why does Harry need a girlfriend? He will never be happy at home, and while I get that part of the Ginny relationship works because she's okay with him off battling battles, because that's what he does, it just never felt right to me.HBP also has the ultimate betrayal (or does it!?) and I remember being SO. ANGRY. and confused. WHY!?One of my least favorites of the series, but it still has some really great moments (Felix Felicis!) and is, ultimately, still Harry Potter.I'm starting Deathly Hallows with a box of tissues next to me.

In fact, Harry is more like a passive observer to these events. This book could have easily not be called Harry Potter but rather \u201cVoltemort, the Early Years\u201d since it was mostly about the origin of the villain. A villain I don\u2019t give a shit about since he got defeated by his own powers and didn\u2019t learn from it.Magic nonsenseThe nonsense of the magic world continues as we see the wizards using their memories as footage instead of video recordings. We hardly remember things as they happened, so memories are an awful source of information. Unlike video recordings, we twist around the events to remember them as we want them to. Which by the way, is something that happens even in the book, as they are proven to be easily falsified. Our impression of the past has little to no relation with how events actually happened. This system of evidence is bullshit!No defensesOnce again, the magic police failed to capture even one of the hundreds of bad guys that escaped and the only people they arrested were innocent wizards who had nothing to do with evil acts. They were so desperate that they had to seek help by children selling magic pranks. You know, stuff like sneeze dust, hearing ears, and invisibility hats. That\u2019s right, the elite in the ministry of magic never heard of simple trinkets, children create for fun. Five thousand years of magic history and this was the first time they heard of an invisibility hat or enhanced hearing. Didn\u2019t these people ever hear of Du0026amp;D? The core books are full of ideas.And once again the security at the school is paper thin. So what if they are now searching school bags and prevent teleportation? The kids could still smuggle in, anything they like through mail. Why do you go as far as searching bags but not the mail you stupid teachers? Those rascals were sneaking in guns and drugs under your very nose! Why were you even surprised when the school is invaded by evil wizards who teleported through a closet, in an area that does not allow teleportation? So much for magic making sense.Circular logicIn this excuse of a story, Harry is given the task to extract memories from a wizard, concerning info about the Big Bad. Disregard how memories are not trustworthy and can easily be altered. Although he did manage to succeed in that, once again it wasn\u2019t done with wits or strategy. No sir, he just cheated, like always. He drank a luck potion which lets him automatically succeed in anything. That\u2019s right, you don\u2019t need to try hard to succeed, you just need a convenient mcguffin which for some reason didn\u2019t exist so far.But wait, you might think, if Harry got the potion because he was very good at potion brewing, means that he did something right and got rewarded for his talent, instead of staying inactive as always. I should be praising him for doing that. Only thing, he didn\u2019t succeed by trying hard. The one who gave him the potion was the same wizard he was sent to extract memories from. Essentially, the conflict resolved on its own, by using circular logic. Harry wasn\u2019t even needed for fulfilling this mission. ANYONE could have done that as long as he had drunk the potion. There is no way of losing if you drink it.Winners always cheatHe also didn\u2019t get the potion by being good at potion brewing, which would excuse him deserving to drink it and extracting the information. He was cheating the whole time by using a notebook full of potion brewing secrets. And no, he is not excused for using those notes properly and thus deserving to get the potion. He deliberately kept the notes hidden from everybody, and pretended he was a genius at brewing potions. What an asshole! And thus, Rowling is once again advising little children to cheat all the time in school instead of trying hard.Character de-evolutionBut wait, who gave him the notebook? Maybe he got it as reward for something he did right, and thus he at least deserves to get the potion by cheating. Nope, he randomly found it without doing anything to deserve it. And as it turns out, it was a trap set by a traitor who was manipulating him throughout the whole book. You would think Harry would be far more careful after the 10th time a teacher of the dark arts is revealed to be a traitor, and an evil notebook that was brainwashing children in the second year. But no, he still falls for it like a complete newb. He has no free will in this whole story and is just moving from one plot device to another plot device because Rowling has no clue how to keep him consistent with past events. And this is what really gets me with fans of the books. They keep praising them for having characters that develop as years go by, when we clearly see here Harry didn\u2019t change one bit. Where are these changes you are talking about? Are you referring to Dumbledore having a different actor in every movie?Disgusting romanceYou want more plot devises? Good because the luck potion is so overpowered that Harry abused it not only for fulfilling his mission, but also to get laid. And he did it in the most despicable way imaginable. He found a girl he liked and charmed her into falling in love with him. This was not achieved through personal charisma, it was the effect of the potion, meaning he brainwashed her. And what makes this situation even worse is that the girl already had a boyfriend. Harry abused the potion to make them have a fight and break up. Meaning, not only he seduced her, he also destroyed the love of two people. What kind of a message is this Rowling? Is this supposed to be romance? You are advising the children who are reading this shit to consider romance being the same as secretly purring Viagra in drinks, so they can get laid.Deus ex potionAnd I am not even done yet. The luck potion is so broken, that it makes all spells targeting you to boomerang back to the guy who casts them. Which is exactly what Harry and some other kids did at the end of the book so they can defeat super elite evil wizards. Screw decades of training hard in mastering magic; epic level wizards got owned by rookies because they drank the potion of plot armor. And of course only the good guys have access to this plot devise and not the bad guys. Because if they did, they would have killed all the powerful good wizards in the world by standing still and letting the spells they are targeting them, to bounce back at their face. Great use of strategy once more Rowling.Winners don\u2019t need to try anymoreWhich brings us to another question. Why did the wizard give such a powerful potion to Harry just for being good at a school session? With this thing you can capture the gold sphere in Quidditch, get laid, or win the lottery. Hell, why think so small; you take over the world with this potion, and you hand it around to anyone who gets an A at a test. You are also rewarding a student who won, by letting him keep winning at everything thereafter without having to try anymore. What kind of logic is this and how is it fair for the rest of the students?Uninteresting deathAnother major secondary character dies at the end of this book and again I am left completely uninterested about it. They can always use the time machine to undo his death. Oh, that\u2019s right, they destroyed the time machines so Voltemort can\u2019t use them. God forbid if they had used them to prevent him from even becoming powerful in the first place, so none of that shit ever happened. Also, the reason the major character got killed was completely stupid. If he had a couple of \u201cwin at everything\u201d potions with him, something he could have easily done since he is a freaking archwizard, this would never have happened. Do you see what happens when you abuse magic to the point nothing matters anymore? And why did he even take Harry with him? He was completely useless the whole time.Demystified fameAnd hold on a freaking second. Spells that bounce back to their caster? What does that reminds me of? Oh that\u2019s right; the way Voltemort was originally defeated. Rowling, are you honestly telling me that there was such a thing all along and people made a legendary hero out of Harry as a baby for something anyone could have done by simply drinking this potion? So what was the point of Voltemort wasting four books in trying to undo the plot armor shield Harry had by his dead mommy when Harry can just drink the potion and get it back? And do you know what else that means? Harry\u2019s fame makes no sense by making the super amazing spell only his parents knew of and nobody else could possibly comprehend or copy, to now be just a side effect of a potion everybody knows about and uses all the time. So what the hell does that mean, everybody who drinks the potion is a legendary hero? Holy shit Rowling, you just power creeped the hell out of plot armor, to the point it makes its super importance that you were constantly rubbing in our faces in the first 4 books completely worthless by now. Epic fail!"},

It's like all of my complaints about Order of the Phoenix are gone now with this book. I really enjoyed learning about Voldemort's past and how he became the dark lord, and Harry's time with Dumbledore. Although I found the whole \"he was always evil, even as a child,\" thing to be a bit lazy on the side of the author. She never really shows a turning point, a place where he turns bad, he was just always that way. I really like that Fleur, who has previously come off as pretty shallow, was abhored by the idea that she would leave Bill just because his face got torn up. The looks into Snape's past are pretty good too, and very subtle, in that you probably won't really see them on the first time through the book. I also really enjoy the ending of this book. The betrayal and death, the fight through the school and down onto the grounds after retrieving the fake Horcrux. I was so disappointed when the movie came out and it was like four people that invaded Hogwarts, and like just Harry trying to fight them off. I mean, this was a huge fight with dozens of people trying to kill each other, and destroying the school around them, and in the movie, Helena Bonham Carter skips around being Helena Bonham Carter and vandalizes the place before they walk out the front door. Whoopie. Whoever made that decision for the end of the movie needs a good kick in the ass. I also like how the love stories are used to bring levity to a pretty dark story, and don't really overstay their welcome. Thank god, a YA writer that understands that a love story SUBplot is a SUBplot, and not the main plot.Anyway, if you've recently stepped into our dimension from a parallel universe where Harry Potter doesn't exist and have never heard of it before, please pick it up. It's a pretty fun and entertaining series for what it is."},

It is very action packed and fast paced and altogether just a very well rounded story. My absolute favorite parts of this book are the lessons Harry takes up with Dumbledore. For one, we get to see a lot more of Dumbledore, and a much more personal side of him that we haven't seen too much of before this moment; and for two, I just absolutely love learning about the past in this world; both of the marauders and as it is in this case, Tom Riddle. Harry and Dumbledore's relationship of a mentor and a pupil, almost a father figure, progresses greatly throughout the events of this story and we as readers really grow it love Dumbledore even more than we already do after seeing a more personal and caring side of him. On the subject of Draco Malfoy: I know that there are plenty of people out there who absolutely love Draco and some that even romanticize his character. Now, I will be the very first to admit that I have never understood that love people seem to have for him. I have always found him a manipulative, cruel, bully who does things for his own gain and to see the humiliation of others. As I've said before, I do realize he's a product of his environment and the way he treats people is what he picked up from his parents but I will never, ever, understand how people can call him brave or just a simply misunderstood kid. He always runs away from a fight or anything in which he won't benefit from, and he isn't 'misunderstood' in the sense that there's another side of him that's actually good; he's a rude and vengeful bully who could be good if he realized an accepted that what he's been taught is wrong, but until that time comes he's just a mean, spoiled, coward who would do anything to save his own skin. Did I feel sorry for Malfoy at any point in this novel as he is dealing with his mission? Sure. Did the sympathy I felt for the difficult situation he was in cancel out the way he has treated everyone that he has bullied in the five books leading up to this novel? No. He even continues to prove that he doesn't care for others safety and is willing to put innocent people at risk to save himself; shown in his attack, whether intentional or not, on Katie Bell and Ron as they were both grievously injured and almost killed because Malfoy didn't have the boldness to do what he had been threatened to do and didn't care who got hurt along the way. Obviously I'm glad that he's a spineless prat and didn't kill his intended target, but his basic lack of respect for innocent people has always bothered me. My newfound Harry/Ginny shipper heart was made very happy during this book, with all of the cute scenes leading up to when Harry finally realizes he has feelings for Ginny that are more than that of a friend. So many little things in the series led up to this coupling, as I have pointed out in other reviews and little things that I have paid more attention to this time around on my reread. Proof, in my mind, that they belong together because they can truly, fully understand each other. Or mainly, that Ginny is one of the few people in Harry's life that kind of can understand what it's like to have their life controlled and taken over by Lord Voldemort. The end of this book will never not be heart wrenching and absolutely devastating. This was actually the first book ever in which I felt truly and utterly betrayed by a book character. Even rereading it now for the millionth time, knowing the full story, I am still horrified by the tragic blow that the Order, and honestly Harry, is dealt in that pivotal scene. I cried my eyes out for literally the last two chapters of this book, probably even harder than I usually do. This series has turned me into a puddle of emotion. Again."},

We have three politicians, each of them fighting for supremacy over the other two, but only one of them seems to realize that there is no supremacy to be had, because there's something much more powerful threatening to crush them all. That's when I suddenly started understanding and almost liking Fudge, with all of his fear and mistrust and resignation.Surprises are not over: the second chapter had me tied in knots and set the feeling for the whole book. That's when I started being actually scared - I felt like I didn't know anything anymore and started making guesswork and wondering about every little piece of information I was drip-fed. Oh, and I began feeling sorry for everyone, too - namely, in this case, Narcissa.Just a little while later - this book is chock-full of wonderful scenes - there's Harry's discussion with Scrimgeour, and I was all like \"Oh my, little Harry is so brave and mature!\" from then on. Really, his badassery amazed me. He's clever, loyal, strong - can I have one too?A while later (it seems like a few hours later to me, but that's because I read the whole book in three days - it's probably something like 400 pages later) there's Aragog's burial, where Harry finally manages to get that memory out of Slughorn. I swear, I wanted to cry with Hagrid and Slughorn. I mean, Hagrid loves a spider, which in and of itself is good enough a reason to hate him forever, and Slughorn may very well have given TR the means to rule the world, but how can you not feel bad seeing two grown men cry?And finally, Harry's breakup with Ginny. It's not a particularly significant scene because of the love story, because, as much as I like Ginny, so far I can't really feel the lurve, but Harry's grown up so much! *cries* Can you believe that six years have passed? Six years? When did that happen?Dumbledore. Dumbledore, Dumbledore, Dumbledore. Oh, sweet baby Jesus. Okay, I didn't cry this time - but it was hard. I had to work to stop myself.I loved him in this book. Totally, positively loved him. Mostly because I finally got to see him as, yes, a powerful wizard, a smart man, a wonderful father figure - but also a fundamentally frail old man.Obviously, I can't not mention all the new couples. Lupin/Tonks gets a wholehearted thumb up, I'm still a bit doubtful about Bill/Fleur, although it's actually sweet how she doesn't even think about leaving him (poor Bill...), Hagrid/Maxime is adorable, Harry/Ginny is cute but I need to see more, and... Ron/Hermione. Gosh, get your head out of your ass, guys. I need that now.So, even though this book basically left me with a sense of complete and utter desperation, the prospect of Ron/Hermione is keeping me alive.

It's pretty much everything I've already said in my reviews for the first five books, so yeah.This one was sad. The end was depressing, even though I knew what happened. Poor Dumbledore. :'(Harry is kind of annoying, but oh well. I like Ron and Hermione. They are so cute. They seem quite realistic too. There's none of that sappy, over-the-top romance in these books. All the romance stuff is like, bickering teenagers, which is much more amusing and believable.I don't really like Ginny much, though. I wish she was more interesting ... Maybe she will be developed more in the last book? Also Harry's interest in her seemed rather sudden and random. Like one day he's just like, \"Ginny is kind of hot. I like her. Oh, but she's Ron's sister. Awkward turtle.\" And then he wouldn't quit whining about it. Ack. Well, whatever. Voldemort is a creeper. I love his life history and whatnot, though. It's super cool.It still blows my mind that J.K. Rowling thought out this series so much. It makes me feel like such a slob as a writer. I'm always like, \"I should probably explain this .... NAH. No one will care.\" But, you know, people do care. So I should probably care more, too. But I don't think I'd have as much patience as Rowling does. I mean, GOSSHHH she has a backstory for like every single character.So yeah, I think that's about it.

It's also a book that's a lot more about Malfoy than it is about Harry. I mean, obviously it's told from Harry's perspective so it's still his story. But on rereads, it becomes apparent that Draco is on Struggle Street for the duration of this book. He's shoved into a situation he doesn't want to be in, he's pale and not sleeping, he's ignored by his teachers and constantly reprimanded by his head of house, and he has to resort to Moaning Myrtle for sympathy. In comparison, Harry's year is a walk in the park. ANYWAY. As is always the case, I found new things this time around, but this time the new thing was rather profound: \"Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realise that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different!\" (Dumbledore to Harry, p. 477) Excuse me while I go and think serious thoughts.2/1/2013I love this book. Like, so much. The ending kills me EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. There's so much backstory, so much explanation of WHY Voldemort is the way he is. I must confess, I DO love Deathly Hallows just that little bit more, but I think that's because of the sense of closure we get. This, however, is the book that makes me wish Ginny had been more prevalent in Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire, and Order of the Phoenix. Because Ginny is freaking AWESOME. She's a total badass, and it sucks that her character spends so much of the series languishing in the background because Harry's too much of a dipshit to notice that she's there. I can understand why some people don't like it - there's a lot of detail, and all the action is crammed into the last fifty or so pages. But at the end of the day, this book serves as a set up to the big finale in Deathly Hallows. And it does so admirably. "},

I know, it's a total guilty pleasure, but damnit, I love that ragtag bunch of misfit wizards. So prepare to be awed by my genius analysis of the eternal question: Is Severus Snape evil? Well, in one word - Completely. Quiet down, quiet down, quit your uproaring and just hear me out. In the world that Rowling created for Harry Potter almost every character is either goodness and light or darkness and doom. Sure they have conflicts and sometimes shit ain't easy, but their motivations are always clean cut. Snape is the one mystery. He seems evil, but he protects Harry, sort of. Dumbledore trusts him, but he makes pacts with the Malfoys. What's a muggle to think? Well, I'll tell you what to think. Snape is only looking out for #1. He's got designs on blossoming from the picked on nerdy potions kid to the unquestioned dark overlord or everything. Oh, spoiler alert: If you haven't read the 6th book, I'm totally about to blow the ending for you. You might be saying, 'Well then why does Dumbledore trust him? Dumbledore's super smart and would know if he was evil.' Well it's because when Dumbledore asks him, \"No, seriously Snape, are you done with Voldemort?\" Snape can say, \"Of course, guy,\" and be telling the truth. He's done with that shit and he's got his eyes on the prize for himself. Even under the control of the Veritaserum he can honestly say he's not working for old Voldy. So thus he gains Dumbledore's trust in that he's no longer a Death Eater. Booyakasha! (And how genius was it for Snape to arrange a plan with Dumbledore to kill him (Dumbledore) at the end of the 6th book!? We all know that shit was preordained, what with all the \"Snape, you just gotta do it,\" jive by big D. So everyone's led to think that even though Snape now seems like a bad guy he really isn't. Oh you poor, feeble-minded saps.) Ok, so now you're going to ask why would Snape ever protect Harry? He hates Harry's dad and he's got no love for the boy either, so why has he saved him in the past? BECAUSE Harry's the only one who can destroy Voldemort and quite possibly vice versa. So what's Snape gonna do? He's gonna pit the two of them against one another and let them destroy each other. Then the way will be clear for Snape to rule unopposed. Ha! Goddamn I'm a genius! "},

I also feel that this one brought back the little things you overlook in the beginning are actually important. I didn't know who the Prince was, though when I was throwing around guesses, I did have it correct. I just didn't have it pegged as that person, but I wasn't surprised to find out. The Weasleys remain the best characters in these books, though Ron is falling out of favor with me. I am so happy that Fred and George got their joke shop! The lessons with Dumbledore was brilliant. There was plenty of Dumbledore's sage advise dispensed in this book. I especially liked what he said about fear at the lake. Speaking of which, the bodies in the lake was super creepy. It reminded me of the Dead Marshes in Lord of the Rings. So glad I did not read that part at night!I did have the ending spoiled before I made it that far. I'm quite upset about that, as I probably should feel more shocked and depressed about it than I actually feel. I was shocked and livid when I heard the spoiler, so.....Snape remains the most intriguing character. I am absolutely convinced that there is much more going on than meets the eye.Neville was barely in this book, which was disappointing after his character really developing in Order of the Phoenix. The whole thing with Tonks and Lupin seemed a little convenient. I NEED BOOK 7 NOWI flipped back and forth between the book and the audio. I do this when my life is really busy and have the option to flip back and forth. You have no idea how much I would love to flip between audio, book, and kindle to fit my reading situation, without having to find my place in each one when I switch formats. Anyway, I had the Jim Dale audio, which I found mediocre at best. Some of his voices and inflections were weird. "},

Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince often gets a rap as the least-liked book in the series, where Harry is the most whiney and obnoxious. In this sixth book of the series, Harry appears very self-involved, constantly stirring over his Potions books, that formerly belonged to the mysterious Half-Blood Prince. He is also torn romantically, pining over someone he doesn't feel he should.Ron and Hermione are at odds for most of the book, neither one wanted to admit or be honest with the other about the true nature of their relationship.Despite Harry becoming Quidditch caption, the game is one of the last things on his mind.And yes, there is that weird stalker-ish obsession Harry has with Malfoy that no one, even Ron and Hermione, think is rational.But despite all of Harry's observable faults in this book, I think it is close to the top of the list as my favorite. I didn't used to think so when I was younger (I was 16 when HBP first came out), but reading it now, nine years later, it is clear that this book is so incredibly complex and detailed.As always, the last 100 pages of the book proved almost too *intense/full of feels*, for lack of a better term, to take. I cried even though I knew what was coming because I love these characters so much, they are part of me.I am very anxious to finish The Deathly Hallows soon so I can go back and marathon all the movies and take notes on my opinions regarding the adaptations of my favorite series!So in summation, there just simply isn't anything like HP for me. Always the best! Always 5 stars :)"},

I know a lot of people didn't like how Harry fell for Ginny, but I didn't mind it. And the insights into Tom Riddle's life was very interesting; while Voldemort will always be the stereotypical bad guy, it was great to know how and why he is the way he is. I also got a kick out of Slughorn, and one of my favorite scenes is at the Christmas party when Slughorn has his arm around Snape, talking about his \"star pupil\". Snape continues to be extremely interesting too - and the fact that he IS the Half-Blood Prince that Harry (and Ron!) have been \"worshipping\" via his old textbook speaks volumes as well (ha, I punned). I've always been a Snape-lover, and when he killed Dumbledore I was surprised (at least, I was the first time I read the book!) but I very quickly came to the conclusion that this was planned between him and Dumbledore; that Dumbledore's pleading \"Severus, please\" was not for his life, but for his death. Because of his withered arm and weakness from the potion he'd drunk, I'm also very convinced that Dumbledore was probably dying anyway.It was good to give this book a very close re-read, since the final book came out, and that review follows..."},

Hasta ahora este es el libro en el que Dumbledore ha tenido m\u00e1s protagonismo, y claro que eso me emociona much\u00edsimo. Es un gran hombre, mago y aparte muy inteligente y bondadoso, en pocas palabras Dumbledore es un personaje muy pero que muy virtuoso que ha hecho el libro m\u00e1s interesante al contar un poquito de todo lo que \u00e9l sabe.

Resumiendo este es un libro lleno de momentos que te ponen el coraz\u00f3n a mil y te hacen sufrir pero tambi\u00e9n momentos para re\u00edrse con las ocurrencias de los personajes, es sensacional en todo el sentido de la palabra.Tengo miedo de leer el \u00faltimo libro.

I'll simply revise my opinion at this point to be you can't really go wrong with either narrator in my opinion.  Full ReviewI have to start with the end. Possibly one of the largest spoilers of all time. At least in terms of people being upset finding it out before reading it. I remember being at a convention the year this came out and people seemed to be making it a point of yelling (view spoiler)[Snape kills Dumbledore (hide spoiler)]. I put that in tags on the very slim chance you either haven't read the book, or somehow avoided that. If you did, I'm impressed. Tell me what your secret is please!People got really creative about this too. I remember someone did a mashup with castaway where Tom Hanks was keeping a copy of the book in that unopened package and then someone flew by the island with the spoiler on a banner behind the plane.I also recall just before the final book came out, people who preordered from Walden books had their choice of bookmark one saying (view spoiler)[Trust Snape (hide spoiler)], and the other: (view spoiler)[Snape is a very bad man (hide spoiler)]. I think I was more in the former camp, than the latter, but it's hard for me to remember anymore.Above all I think this division among readers during what felt like a very long waiting time until Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows came out, is what is best about this book. It is certainly THE cliffhanger of the series.Also, in this book, Ms. Rowling finally starts to reveal some of the deeper secrets of the series as Harry and Dumbledore explore memories of the past.As a grown adult, I find the descriptions of (view spoiler)[Harry's feelings toward Ginny (hide spoiler)] both amusing and nostalgic. I remember having similar feelings when I was I was high school. I don't miss that \"monster\" as Harry calls it.[Snape kills Dumbledore (hide spoiler)][Trust Snape (hide spoiler)][Snape is a very bad man (hide spoiler)][Harry's feelings toward Ginny (hide spoiler)]"},

I was such a rebellious teenager keep trying out all my silly phases I want to be u0026amp; it was hilarious! Also, when I first finished this book, I appreciate it a little more because we have a 600 bloody pages of Harry Potter book where Harry focused more on Slytherin characters u0026amp; it made my entire year! The mourning period when I finished this book was so excruciating that I took a day off school because I was busy crying my heart out (the night before) for everything that had happened u0026amp; what about to happened in the last book with all those theories u0026amp; questions keep circling around my mind for so long.This year when I finally decided to join the read-along, I never imagined that it'll be more hurtful that previous years.. From the start, I was so excited to re-read this book u0026amp; the moment I was reading it, I never thought of losing one of the casts who portrayed a HUGE u0026amp; IMPORTANT character in my favourite book will be leaving us. A really tragic news for The Potterheads family including JK Rowling. I was clutching the book when I heard about the news u0026amp; it hit me hard. The book used to make me hate Snape so much but after all this years, I understood what he stood for u0026amp; why he did what he did but that didn't mean that I hate Alan himself. He's such a talented person u0026amp; wonderful human being. He brought what Snape really should be to life u0026amp; I will always be grateful for that.My 1st memory of Alan Rickman was when I was six (15 years ago). My dad brought me to the Philosopher's Stone screening then we bought the book u0026amp; I ended up reading it that night. The scene I remember most was Snape's potion class u0026amp; I think the reason is because of how scary (at that age) I though Snape was but Alan portrayed his part u0026amp; character amazingly well. It might not seem much to people, but it's my first HP memory u0026amp; it happened to include Alan.Gone.. but never forgotten. You'll be remembered as the bravest man we've ever known. You made my childhood more imaginative u0026amp; magical. My thoughts are with his family u0026amp; friends. Rest in peace, Sir Alan Rickman. The world will miss you. Always. Rest, Dear Half-Blood Prince for your soul is amongst the brightest stars in the sky!#RIPAlanRickman \u2661"},

This book has more romance than any the rest of the Harry Potter series and has a teenage soap opera feel to it. When I first read this book I never guessed that Snape was the Half-Blood Prince and he had such a big role in this book and the next book. Hermione says that love potions are not that dangerous but in the wrong hands it can be used very unethically and even as a date rape drug. I really liked learning more about Voldemort\u2019s past and how young Tom Riddle became Voldemort. I love the Weasley family as they are kind and warm and the family that Harry had never had. I did find it odd that Harry mourned more for Cedric, an acquaintance and kind of friend, than Sirius, his Godfather and someone he saw as a father figure. But I did like how Harry and Hermione\u2019s friendship grows closer in this book as it always felt Harry was closer to Ron than Hermione. This is the one book which you can tell it was written by a woman, this is because the way Rowling wrote Hermione\u2019s action and reactions to Ron fit perfectly to how most girls would act. One thing is that Harry likes dull chicks, as while Ginny is described as being fun and feisty I just never saw it, and it felt I was told this, not shown it. Also Dumbledore is such a liar as he said he had told Harry everything about Voldemort and Harry, but he really didn\u2019t, and it shows that even after all those years he still believes in The Greater Good (\u201cThe Greater Good\u201d). Is it just me or does Professor Slughorn with his bald head and walrus moustache remind you of Jamie from Mythbusters? I love Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and I would recommend it to anyone who likes this series. This and my other reviews can be found at Amethyst Bookwyrm"},
{"rating": 5, "text": "This has got to be the best cliffhanger ever. There is such power in this book. It is my favorite in the series for one very important reason: since book one, Severus Snape has been my favorite character and this is his book, albeit not his story yet. His power, his intelligence, his confusing range of emotions and allegiance, finally come to full attention. I argued with many a doubter about his motives, and yet in my wildest imagination, I could not have justified him as well as Rowling doesThis has got to be the best cliffhanger ever. There is such power in this book. It is my favorite in the series for one very important reason: since book one, Severus Snape has been my favorite character and this is his book, albeit not his story yet. His power, his intelligence, his confusing range of emotions and allegiance, finally come to full attention. I argued with many a doubter about his motives, and yet in my wildest imagination, I could not have justified him as well as Rowling does is book 7. Even knowing the ending beforehand, I still found myself wanting more in the inadequate moments between Harry and Dumbledore. The sense of longing was perfectly planted for our heightened frustration and sadness in the end. I figured it was going to happen anyway, but it still got me. Rowling pulls you into these characters' lives. You are at Hogwarts mourning, afraid, alone with the lot of them. Even the emotional conclusion of book 7 did not affect the same power of emotion in readers you find in book 6. But more than wishing for more time for Harry, I wanted (needed) to understand the anger and sadness in Snape's verbal attack. That is the beauty of book 6 is the ambiguity of it.Initially I was frustrated between the summarizing instead of detailed accounts Rowling uses in every other book, but it correlates perfectly with the ambiguity of the story. This one got people talking (all I wanted to do after reading it was discuss). It left room for interpretation. Most importantly it left us impossibly waiting for a series conclusion. I reread book 6 a week before the release of book 7 and my anticipation was so high even those few days of waiting were agony. "},

I never would have guessed! I found all that teenage angst and agonizing over relationships -albeit accurately portrayed- a bit tedious and tiresome. Voldemort's backstory was very intriguing. That said, the sixth book is not the best in the series in my opinion, but it's very, very good in its own right. So far, I like The Prisoner of Azkaban and The Goblet of Fire best. But still, The Half-Blood Prince is a terrific book and the rest are excellent. I cannot wait to read the finale. However, it won't be my next read because I don't want the series to end just yet. They've been insanely entertaining and enchanting reads."},

Rowling)**Read at your own risk**All is not going pretty well in the wizarding world.As dark forces gather, no one and no place is safe. Wizards and witches are being kidnapped, attacked at every turn and some murdered in cold blood. The obituary pages of the Daily Prophet are browsed with as much frequency as the headlines. Nasty turns of events are also felt by the Muggle government as Lord Voldemort and his cohorts wreak havoc on the non magical population. The Ministry of Magic, on the contrary, is doing one hell of a bad job from preventing these and doing all it can to cover up their inadequacies \u2014 much to the chagrin of the wizarding community.However, for Harry, Ron and Hermione, life must go on. In their sixth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, on the prospect of choosing a future career path, they will learn how to Apparate; will have their (yet again) new Defense Against the Dark Arts, as well as, Potions teacher; and like any regular teens undergoing adolescence will learn to fall in and out of love \u2014 flirtations and stalkers included. Still, there are far more that Harry is preoccupied with. For one, there\u2019s Dumbledore\u2019s badly injured hand which he declines to explain and his frequent absences from Hogwarts. Moreover, Harry receives helpful advices from a battered Potions book annotated by someone enigmatically named as the Half-Blood Prince.The beauty of the Harry Potter series is in its structure: with every succeeding volume as we follow Harry through his schooling with his bunch of friends, devoted fans and readers grows along with them. Its genius lies in its utterly captivating magical alternate world of wands and flying broomsticks and as the book\u2019s pages and plot alike thickens, it expands our wonder and amazement at J.K. Rowling\u2019s wicked inventiveness. Constantly present in all the six books I\u2019ve read so far is Rowling\u2019s deftness in creating a character-driven story that engagingly melds a coming-of-age narrative with a dash of action-thrilling scenes interwoven with elements of a quest tale and intriguing mystery to boot. To read her books is like tumbling down a rabbit hole of half-remembered childhood delight, of being under a spell akin to discovering the joys of reading such a good book for the first time.Taking center stage in the sixth volume is Lord Voldemort\u2019s back story from his infamous predecessors; the circumstances surrounding his birth; how he came about his prodigious capacities; his schooling at Hogwarts; his continuing interest and gravitation toward the dark arts; up to how he ultimately reinvented himself as the Dark Lord, whom everyone fears, that Harry discovers via the magical device called the Pensieve, a repository for people\u2019s memories, with Dumbledore as his guide. Right now I\u2019m still marveling how cleverly Rowling used this enchanted tool, fusing it as a narrative contrivance to tell us these flashbacks, which I think was employed rather too much, but with the way she teases our minds with tidbits of clues makes me forgive her at that.Prince is definitely treading on darker grounds and, being one with others who noticed earlier, the occurrences depicted in the book do strike some resemblances to our paranoid times besieged with constant threats of terrorism. Students pass through a sensor (which Rowling called a \u201cProbity Probe\u201d) upon entering or leaving school grounds. Stan Shunpike, a character introduced in the third book as the Knight Bus\u2019s conductor, was arrested in a Guantanamo-style preventive detention on the basis of being a Death Eater without even substantial evidence. Then there\u2019s the Horcruxes which can be made by splitting one\u2019s soul through the act of murder that rendered Lord Voldemort near-immortal and one of the reasons why he\u2019s still alive after the curse trying to kill baby Harry backfired. Well, how more evil can you get than that?Of course one of the memorable and saddest parts of the book is Prof. Dumbledore\u2019s untimely demise which makes this installment the most unsettling and emotionally-charged thus far. At first there\u2019s denial, but as the sudden realization sinks in, you really can\u2019t do anything but accept it. It\u2019s such an emotional blow to Harry and the readers that such a noble character, being the most powerful wizard of the age and the only one feared by the Dark Lord, is also susceptible, all too mortal like us.Harry is tougher now, in complete control of his temper and emotions and unafraid to challenge authority figures. One of the scenes that I really liked is when he nonchalantly and frankly declines the offer of the new Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, to be the Ministry\u2019s poster boy. All too well aware of loss and death, no one can endure such hardships without being altered, and Harry is no exception. His responsibility of being the \u201cChosen One\u201d coupled with his growing reputation as the symbol of hope tasked to vanquish Lord Voldemort makes him increasingly isolated; causing him to sacrifice his romantic involvement with Ginny Weasley given the dangers he would have to face and the burden of playing the role of a lone hero. More than asserting himself of being a \u201cDumbledore\u2019s man through and through\u201d he must learn to be his own. Only by seeking his own identity armed and protected by his ability to love, might be his only slim chance to overcome the looming dark tide of war. It\u2019s such a shame that he sees his capacity to show human tenderness as both a distraction and a weakness, though this attribute, in reality, distinguishes him from his evil adversary as Dumbledore pointed out.Watching the movie first took most of the fun I could have had derived from reading the book. Actually, this one has become a perfunctory reading for me just to be reminded of the plot points (that the screen adaptation brazenly dispense with) as I prepare myself for the highly-anticipated final book in the series. Yet when I started to speculate, think of what might happen to Harry, of what\u2019s in store for him in his quest to destroy the Hocruxes amd his eventual battle with Lord Voldemort in the seventh book is where, I think, the real fun starts. If, in reading this book review bored you enough, then let me tickle your brains with enough questions that remain and begs to be answered:\u00b7 Where does Snape\u2019s loyalty lie? Is he really a Death Eater or in fact acting as a double agent for the Order of the Phoenix? For Snape haters they maybe resigned to the former but as I\u2019ve come to learn from reading this series, nothing and no one is what it seemed to be. I\u2019m hoping that he\u2019ll redeem his character and may have some credible explanation why he did what he has to do in this novel.\u00b7 Is the locket referred to in passing in the fifth book the same as the fake one Harry and Dumbledore found in the cave? If so, then who got it now? Does Kreacher have it since he\u2019s the caretaker of 12 Grimmauld Place or was it stolen by Mundungus Fletcher?\u00b7 And who is this person with the mysterious initials R. A. B. that switched the real locket with a fake one? What is his agenda for doing this? Will Harry be able to speak with him or has he taken his story to the grave?\u00b7 How will Harry proceed now without Dumbledore to guide him and as clueless as it was in the beginning to the whereabouts of the remaining Horcruxes? What were James and Lily Potter were like when tragedy hadn\u2019t befallen them yet? Furthermore, what are the similarities and circumstances that connect Harry to Lord Voldemort that\u2019s left to be uncovered?More than being an exciting denouement and the penultimate in the series, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a good introduction to the last and final book. Like previous books we still hunger to know more about these characters that we\u2019ve grown so much to love, following their fate that\u2019s inextricably tied to the two wizards that will shape wizarding history to come. I\u2019m still clueless how the series will be heading.As the story grips us spellbound, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll still be gaping, enchanted and bracing for more\u2026_____________Published by Scholastic Inc.

I'm sure I've written about it in a review before, but I'm going to recount it -- briefly -- here. We were in Japan, on a night train. (I already felt pretty magical, being in a foreign place AND being on a night train meant I could pretend I was on the Knight Bus.) Shut myself up with this book, and the only memory I have is of eagerly reading \"The Cave\", vividly imagining myself there, too, with Harry and Dumbledore, battling the Inferni.This is my favorite Harry Potter book. The memories, the feeling of it really coming together more, the story and the mystery on two levels. Who is the Half-Blood Prince? What is Malfoy up to? It enticed me as a child, and still gets me to this very day.It's a great book, and it shows JK's real depth of knowledge with this series. I can't imagine the world-building she did for this series, and every time I read it I find it utterly incredible to see little details that show it again and again.Now that I've gotten the gushing out of the way, the rest of my review is going to be focused on a character. I ran a poll for this, because I couldn't decide. The poll results were that I talk about my opinions and feelings about Dumbledore. Aka, this is where I spoil book seven if you haven't read it already, and maybe also make you hate me a bit.I have a real love/hate relationship with Dumbledore's character now that I'm older. When I was younger, I was very much like Harry; I was in awe of Dumbledore, and I thought he could do no wrong. As I grew, I still felt that, but I also could see things that he shouldn't have done. I still thought he was a great character, a trustworthy one. Now, I'm very conflicted. Throughout this series, I've been reading for Dumbledore's character, and I can honestly say I feel more enlightened now that I have. Yet, I'm conflicted. On one hand, I see Dumbledore as an amazing mentor who is flawed, but aren't all adults? He made some bad choices, ones that haunted him for the rest of his life and, again, what adult hasn't done that? Then, on the other hand I see him, again, as very flawed. However, I see him as power hungry. Not in the political sphere, but in another way. Knowledge. Defeating people. And, what we discover about his past in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows doesn't make that feeling go away, merely strengthen it.One of my favorite things, which ties into this, on the internet with theories is about The Three Brothers analogy. Voldemort is the first, power hungry, brother. Snape is the second brother, who pines for the past. Harry is the third brother, who welcomes Death as an old friend. And Dumbledore is Death. It's a great analogy.I can see pieces of Dumbledore in all of them.Voldemort, of course, is extremely power hungry. But, he and Dumbledore are, in a way, alike. As we find out in the final book, we know that Dumbledore was involved with another dark wizard. He agreed that wizards are best and Muggles need to be, slightly, put in their place. He plotted a takeover. The power got to his head, as you see it happen throughout the series in front of you. Dumbledore and finding out that Voldemort has his body back; a new challenge, something new to take down. Dumbledore and the Horcruxes. Dumbledore and the Deathly Hallows. He is drawn to power. Perhaps he doesn't want it for himself, but it entices him. Which makes him somewhat like Voldemort.On the other hand, Dumbledore is incredibly like Snape. Snape will have a whole review dedicated to him, don't worry. He pines for the past, which people know if you've read the whole series. Dumbledore does as well. He never forgives himself for involving himself with a dark wizard and the terrible outcome of that: His sister's death. In \"The Cave\" chapter, you see that so vividly, and it honestly hurts to read it. You can imagine that anguish, that deep hatred for yourself. And... it hurts.And, finally, there's Harry. Dumbledore welcomes death. He is not afraid of it, seeing it as an inevitable end and the next great adventure. After so many years of escaping it, he finally meets it because there's no other way.Dumbledore is one of the most complex characters I've met in a children's book. When you're young, you can see him as perfect. The older you get, the more flaws you see. It's incredible what JK Rowling created, and I don't ever think I'll be able to put a finger on exactly how I feel about him."},

I've tried to read other things in between, instead of just binge reading, but I've found that I have trouble getting into anything else because all I can think about is continuing the series. And I know I'm going to have a book hangover from this series! It's definitely special, and it's going to be hard to read something that compares after this!  I have to say I was kind of underwhelmed with the reveal of Snape being the Prince. I mean, it made sense after Hermione explained it, but there wasn't really a big revelation there. It was just kind of like, Oh, I'm the Half Blood Prince...and then was barely mentioned again even though the book is named after him and the Prince's book was a major part of the whole story.  Also DUMBLEDORE OMG. I had trouble believing it at first, which is ridiculous - I remember his death very clearly in the movie, so I *knew* he was dead but even still, it didn't seem real! I still can't get over it. I did eventually start crying when they were all talking about it, and again at his funeral. I CANNOT DEAL. *sobs*  FINALLY, Harry and Ginny get together! I didn't realize how late in the series it happened. I kept waiting for it! Also, I kinda wanted to bash Ron's and Hermione's heads together. They clearly have the hots for each other!   Something I absolutely love about this series is that there is never a love triangle between Ron, Hermione, and Harry. Harry and Hermione are never more than just best friends. It's so rare to see platonic love in stories, and I wish there was more of it! Boys and girls CAN just be friends, people. I love that Harry and Hermione prove it. And it's absolutely beautiful! They are as close as brother and sister and I love it so much! I think their friendship is one of my favorites in fiction. I want a platonic friendship as deep as they have.

In this book Snape finally got what he wanted aka the DADA post meanwhile Harry has taken a private lesson with Dumbledore to learn more about Voldemort\u2019s background and childhood. Voldemort, despite being a villainous piece of shit, is actually an interesting character. Unlike most villains in children\u2019s books (is Harry Potter even a children book, though? It\u2019s more, YA, i think?) Voldemort is actually dangerous and well.. a villain. He kills, he tortures, he steals, and he done it so well. He actually act like a true villain and to read about his childhood and his history, it was quite a ride. In this book we\u2019re also introduced to the Horcrux (which will lead to a satisfying but devastating conclusion in the next book) and that Harry actually had came across the Horcrux before (the diary in chamber of secret). So near the ending of the book Dumbledore and Harry went off to find one of the Horcrux and when they got back to Hogwarts they found the dark marks glowing bright. Then the worst thing happen, Snape killed Dumbledore. If you haven\u2019t read book 7 you will be furious because all your worst suspicion about Snape finally came true. (But if you have read book 7 you will understand that killing Dumbledore wasn\u2019t easy for him nor was it his decision). I was so sad when Hagrid found Dumbledore\u2019s death (his death itself wasn\u2019t that sad for me). Hagrid had always said about how much of a good man Dumbledore was, he trusted him, looked up to him, loved him even. I don\u2019t like to think about how devastating it was for Hagrid to be the one who had to carry Dumbledore away, to hold his lifeless body. I know, I know, I\u2019m getting melancholic, a bit emotional too, but it\u2019s bound to happen everytime I talk about something Harry Potter related.Once again I have to say that I\u2019m glad I got on the HP bandwagon when I was a kid. This feeling I am feeling right now isn\u2019t something I could feel towards books I read just recently. I can\u2019t quite describe it. Sometimes it is sadness, longing, and joy all mixed into one which I can only relate to something I love from my childhood. Is it nostalgia? Yes, i think it is. And this book is literally perfect.

In Band 5 war es der Kampf im Ministerium, in Band 6 alles ab dem Moment, wo Harry und Dumbledore den Horkrux suchten. Es liest sich immer wie ein einziger langer Atemzug und ich kann vor Aufregung nicht aufh\u00f6ren zu lesen. Keine Pausen, kein \"Ach, und es verging wieder eine Woche\", sondern halt ein durchg\u00e4ngiges oh gott oh gott so much is happening. So. Und nun schaue ich gleich den Film und starte morgen Band 7, miep.Edit:Eins noch: Gerade die letzten Szenen mit Harry und Dumbledore haben mich viel zu sehr an Gandalf und Moria erinnert. Und die Inferi im Wasser waren wir die Toten in den Dead Marshes oder wie die in HdR nochmal hie\u00dfen. Naja. Das nagt etwas an mir."},

I find Harry and Ginny way cuter in the books than in the movies lol.  'I am not worried, Harry,' said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. 'I am with you.'  \"...whether in a month, a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione.\" "},

I think once I finish Deathly Hallows I will be doing a discussion video of sorts because often I'm asked why I don't rate all the HP books 5 stars or why it took me so long to read them etc. So yeah. Overall good book, 3.5/5 stars. And onto Deathly Hallows which is even bigger than this one. Oh boy. "},

{"rating": 0, "text": "I don't really know what I think of the beginning, since the first two (clearly important) scenes are done outside Harry's frame of reference. The whole point of the books has been that we're in limited 3rd person POV - we find things out when Harry does. That's been the clearly established rule for 5 books, I don't understand why we're changing it in the 6th. Obviously the point of being an author is that you make the rules, but once you've made your own rules you're supposed to abide by themI don't really know what I think of the beginning, since the first two (clearly important) scenes are done outside Harry's frame of reference. The whole point of the books has been that we're in limited 3rd person POV - we find things out when Harry does. That's been the clearly established rule for 5 books, I don't understand why we're changing it in the 6th. Obviously the point of being an author is that you make the rules, but once you've made your own rules you're supposed to abide by them until you've also created an exception. That can be done more easily with substantive rules - you can have vampires wander around in direct sunlight eating garlic for all I care, if you say why you're doing it. But a style rule that's been clearly established isn't supposed to be broken, unless you need information that CAN'T be conveyed any other way, and I don't see why she couldn't have conveyed the information in those scenes later in the book in the usual way. Okay, yes, it's clearly important that we know about the Unbreakable Vow, but Harry found out about it anyway, so I'm not sure why we had to know about it when we did. The point could have been to introduce Narcissa and use Bellatrix again, but I'm not sure why we care. Or I guess it could have been that we suspect Snape, which would definitely be fun and games, but I'm suspicious of that clearly planted suspicion. My best guess is that we need to know not only THAT Snape made the Unbreakable Vow, but WHAT he vowed to do, and that must have been the most convenient way to do it. Also, I would like to veto love triangles. I know, I know - we have a bunch of 16 year olds of the two genders in constant close quarters, it would be more shocking if we DIDN'T have triangles. But it's woeful to have to read it for a million billion pages. And Ron really can be a spectacular McAsshat when he wants to. (Lavender? Really? I have nothing against her, but really?) Although I worry about where she's going with Ron and Hermione - they FIGHT. A LOT. And I don't think that would change that much, no matter what happens...it hasn't been the \"bickering of unspoken passion\" all this time. I think Ron started the snarking of move around Year 4, but Hermione has been thoroughly...Hermione until this year. Also, I kind of like her with Viktor Krum, because it was FUNNY. Although I am surprisingly myself by being a supporter of Harry-Ginny. I heart Ginny and I think she would work well with him. I mean, if it goes bad it will go VERY VERY BAD, as Harry himself as pointed out, but maybe it won't go bad. Maybe there will be ONE THING in this ENTIRE SERIES that doesn't end up going bad. ....Or she could be the one who dies at the end of book 7 WAH VETO.One disadvantage of being a Johnny (jill?) come lately is that I knew that Dumbledore died, just like I knew that Sirius died, but I managed to block that out with the supreme conviction of someone who believes that the bad ending will have worked itself out by the time she gets there. Unfortunately, it did not, and I am deprived of Dumbledore as I was deprived of Sirius, and yea verily I cried. I cried harder for Sirius than for Dumbledore, though I'm not sure why - probably because why Dumbledore's death wasn't a shock, how it happened was, and I was too busy screaming \"WHAT THE F!\" at the book to really be emotionally wracked. I had to go back and read it twice just to make sure I really understood what had just happened, because it seemed like there was just no way. So the end.....W. T. EEEEEEFFFFFFFF. I mean, what WAS that? Was it an Imperious Curse? Was it the consequences of the Unbreakable Vow? Or have Ron and Harry been right all this time? And it's so utterly bizarre because earlier in the book I'd been thinking about how even though Snape doesn't always like it, in the end he does usually seem to do what's right, like when he made Lupin the serum or when he tried to teach Harry Occlumency-whatever, even though he doesn't like it, and that was what had me convinced that Dumbledore was right in trusting him. And I'd thought that maybe if Harry just sucked it up and apologized to Snape and actually tried being polite it might help - like if he'd had sorry for his accidental disemboweling of Malfoy. I mean, yes, Malfoy was trying to use the Cruciatus on him, but I'd been thinking if Harry just manned up and said to Snape, \"Professor, I'm sorry I did that,\" without making excuses, that might make a different. But then after all of that it turns out that HOLY MOTHER OF JESUS HOWARD CHRIST ON A POGO STICK SNAPE BETRAYED THE POTTERS???? and I seriously rethought that idea.And then...and then after ALL of that, has he really been still working for Voldemort this ENTIRE TIME? I mean, I'd wondered if everyone circling you for all those years going Dumbledore trusts you but we don't and we just want to make that VERY VERY CLEAR could eventually crack you, and then--wha--wha--what? And Dumbledore DIED FOR A FAKE HORCRUX AND WHO THE FUDGE IS R.A.B.?? My brain has just waved a tiny white flag and crawled into the corner to cry. Dear J.K. Rowling: please cease and desist phunking with my heart."},

However, I will say that in retrospect, this is a fairly entertaining read and Rowling should receive credit for that.There is something about HP despite its lack of quality that makes me want to bury my head in these books and live there. Perhaps even more so than Percy Jackson, which I rate to be superior to these books because Riordan is much more structurally consistent and in control of his writing. Although Rowling's tone is often wobbly, you can see that she's still managed to build the atmosphere of HP from childish and charming into something more dark and mature--the fact that we sense it, regardless of the technical failings, surely exemplifies that. We grow alongside Harry, having fun with all his adventures as well as encountering all the classic marks of the Hero's Journey--encountering of death, first experiences of grief, that sense of conflict we all feel when we realize that not all is right with the world. The characters, although rather unsubtle, feel real in such a way that the story makes sense, even if the world-building and exposition don't. The predictability of the cliche stereotypes and archetypes Rowling uses for her characters is compensated for by genuine, sympathetic psychological motivations she puts behind them. And the social/political commentary regarding the Ministry of Magic and the hierarchy of Hogwarts is fairly well done, if not completely original. I always got the feeling that Rowling had some important observations to make about the world, but lacked the eloquence to articulate them as effectively as the story demanded.Which brings me to my major problem with this book, and this series as a whole. Rowling is rarely in control of her writing. The prose, although charming and entertaining, has a bit of a hit-and-miss feel with the adverbs and heavy-handed descriptors. And as many people have pointed out, the last-minute plot devices (view spoiler)[Horcruxes (hide spoiler)] are badly foreshadowed--if at all--in the rest of the series, making it feel as if Rowling cares more about her world as a source of cheat tools than a well-developed setting. And besides the more specific failings, there's really not much of a better way I can put it: you can feel Rowling's lack of confidence every step of the story. It's there, not just in the technical components, but also in her authorial voice. In my experience, there is a difference between sensing the presence of the author because the story feels self-assured, and sensing the presence of the author because she's constantly slipping and sliding. Rowling for me falls decidedly into the latter.And I don't really buy the \"it's for children\" argument either. I first read this series when I was twelve, and my general impression has remained unchanged. I had trouble figuring out why HP was so hugely popular because it seemed utterly unremarkable to me at the time, but looking back and rereading this, I think I know why. For all the sloppiness of these stories, the emotional content is extremely well grounded; and it makes sense for Rowling, under all the pressure of millions of fans trying to second-guess her every move, that she would try to attach herself to the characters, and even if she overdid it, the character development is the main redeeming quality of this series. Even the introduction of the (view spoiler)[Horcruxes (hide spoiler)]--a common plot device in fantasy stories--is rather nicely smoothed out because it progresses alongside the character reveals of Horace Slughorn, who is quite a realistic depiction of an adult who has failed to fully confront his conscience. At least Rowling attempts to address her literary weaknesses, although she doesn't succeed in hiding them.I know this review might seem insulting to the hardcore HP fans out there, but trust me: I get it. At least I think I do. Rowling has imagination, she has talent, she has some relevant things to say about the world and she says them in a way that makes it easy for the target audience to draw some valuable things--most specifically the ability to identify with the characters and the struggle of growing up without self-centered justification. Maybe if I was a little less skeptical as a twelve year old I might have been pouring over these books until they fell to pieces in my hands. As it is, however, I will continue to think of HP not as a classic destined to withstand the test of time, but as a semi-successful writing experiment on Rowling's part that managed to spark the imaginations of millions of kids--even if I wasn't one of them.[Horcruxes (hide spoiler)][Horcruxes (hide spoiler)]"},

The plot is dark. Harry is back at Hogwarts and things are supposed to be back to normal but sinister plans are brewing at Hogwarts. Worst summary ever to be honest but shit gets really dark you guys. Everyone knows Voldemort is actually back and people are disappearing left and right or dying or going to jail for things they didn\u2019t do. It slowly but surely starts to affect the students at Hogwarts and everyone is choosing sides. My favorite part about this book was finally figuring out some things about Voldemort and to get some answers about his actions and why he became the way he did. Especially after all the instances where you think he\u2019s finally dead and gone, but he just keeps kicking! It\u2019s nice to finally have some answers even though it wasn\u2019t the most pleasant of discoveries. Honestly, I just want him gone for good. Those last few chapters though completely broke my heart. I was totally devastated over what happened! I knew something bad was gonna happen, I knew things were going to collide in a way that would mean pain and heartache but I did not think that that was going to happen! It\u2019s still insane to me. I haven\u2019t wrapped my head around it completely. Harry has grown up. Like a lot. There\u2019s such a huge contrast between the boy he started out as the man he is becoming now. He\u2019s sad and vulnerable but as determined as always. I love him, I really do and I think he has the biggest heart and the best intentions considering how much pain he\u2019s been through. But he started developing these obsessive tendencies that were annoying. I understand why he acted that way and he was completely right but god, it was just so annoying and frustrating. I just wanted to shake him! I feel really bad saying this but I don\u2019t know what Ron is for. I feel like I don\u2019t know him enough and it\u2019s been six books! He just feels like such a shallow character. I like him; I just don\u2019t feel like I understand who he is or his motivations. Hermoine is my boo but she got a bit annoying for me as well. However, she\u2019s so powerful and smart. Those boys would be lost without her, I promise you. I don\u2019t usually mention this character but I have to say that I felt really bad for Draco in this book. He\u2019s always been a huge pain in the ass and an arrogant little shit head but he\u2019s placed in such a horrible position. He has such high expectations placed on his shoulders and he\u2019s trying so hard to be brave but he\u2019s not ready at all. It broke my heart a little bit. But he\u2019s still an ass."},

I felt like smacking sixteen-year-olds doing the teen angst thing - think I got my lifetime's supply from Buffy or something - but I'm sure that's all very realistic; real teenagers make me feel like that too sometimes. Just because its realistic doesn't necessarily make it interesting to read though. The big reveal is fairly obvious, so that you pretty much see it coming from halfway through the book; hmmm... who could the slightly evil expert potion-maker from Hogwarts past be? And Malfoy (gasp!) turns out to be up to no good... now _there's_ a surprise. Actually the whole series is starting to remind me of the X-files, with Harry playing the part of young Mulder in a dress. First, Harry/Mulder acquires a tiny scrap of inconclusive evidence and builds an incredibly complex conspiracy theory on it which ends up blaming his enemies. Everyone around him fails to believe him because his evidence is scanty and hes obviously biased, but in the end, he turns out to be right anyways. The moral of the story is apparently that you should persecute people you don't like mercilessly regardless of fact, because in the end they will turn out to be behind whatever might be going wrong in your life. And meanwhile, after the 5th or 6th time its happened, you want to scream at Ron/Hermione/Scully to just BELIEVE him instead of being reasonable because facts or no facts is he EVER wrong? Dumbledore dying was very sad, but Harry breaking up with Ginny to keep her safe had no emotional impact, since he does it in such a condescending way - never even asks her opinion - and we'd barely seen them together in any case.The first ones were aimed at kids but appealed to all of us because we all, deep-down, still like to think we're a bit of a kid.

With the prejudices of the magical community, Tom could have been given so many motivations beyond just being the wizard equivalent of Demian. I was expecting so much more. The Horcrux adventures were dull... I didn't realize this was an RPG. There was a severe lack of any interesting adult character scenes... this was why I loved OotP so much. The Order was interesting and captivating. PoA pulled me into the series because of the adult backstory it presented... the adults are far more interesting than the kids when they are presented properly. Hermoine being a mopey puppy in love. Ron just making out constantly. DRACO CRYING IN BATHROOMS!? Draco doesn't feel sympathy for others... if anything he'd only be worried about failing at his mission, and that wouldn't cause tears. He's a self-serving weasel, he would only worry about his own interests. This was maybe the only time Rowling tried to give character growth to a child character in this novel and she failed miserably at it. The end of book 6 was miserable. Tonks and Remus are essentially destroyed as interesting characters. I literally threw the book at the love confession. It was so tacked on, so poorly handled, so UNNECESSARY. Most of this book was unnecessary. The franchise ended with OotP for me. I don't know why poor writing isn't more easily recognized.

Because at the moment I think he's pretty shitty and awful!! (hide spoiler)]"}
