I really started to feel the characters after seeing the movies. I could hear them in my head their accents and everything!I forgot that there was a WOMAN behind the scenes. Someone a lot like me.J.K. Rowling was a single mother of two kids and on welfare! She started the books not really understanding what an impact they would make in people's lives!She never thought her books would be banned and hated my many people.Or that many billions more would LOVE her and her brilliant writing skills.I have learned that we all are magical beings. No matter what religion we are, we have love, bravery and imaginations...we are creative and romantic...There is a story in all of our hearts. I found that I have been fighting DEMENTORS and Voldemort's for a long time. I found that my own life struggles are a lesson for me. A journey I must take sometimes alone and sometimes with friends or family.Before I read Deathly Hallows I understood something, Death is a part of our Lives. We cannot survive one without the other. If we are not born we would not die.We must do both.I knew this before reading the last book.I have the Magic in me to survive death, by walking right into it when the time comes.It will not be a terrible thing, only leaving behind the ones we love and knowing that they will miss us sorely. Knowing that and end of our journey here the end of our story...the book will be replaced on the shelve and maybe not read again for a long time...When someone we love takes a photo of us or a letter we wrote long ago while we lived, and read it and for a moment remember us and we will be alive again in a memory in a heart beat in the tears...We will be once more remembered and for a few moments alive...and then we will rest again...a memory for another day. Inside the hearts of those who love us we will remain alive and warm and LOVED...Our spirit will have long journeyed on to a new place a new time making more friends and families and stories...I love my mind how it is.I might not be societies perfect person but who is?I have flaws.I am moody and emotional. I love too much and give of myself. I am a great friend and mother. A healer and artist and creator of stories and I grow plants and care for animals...I am human.I am me.And J.K. Rowling where ever you may be, THANKS I did enjoy my travels with you and Harry and ALL those wonderful people you created to become a part of my life and memories. Because it will add some excitement to the pages of my life-book! I am sure my girls will always remember my nerdish obsession with HARRY POTTER.THIS BOOK: HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Is not for ALL children under the age of oh let's say 10.It is full of death and killing. Of course it was coming, all this drastic drama, but I really do not see a reason for J.K. Rowling to feel she needed to kill certain people.I will not spoil WHO gets the axe, but I have never cried so much in any of these books!However in LIFE there comes DEATH, and some people must stand up and choose between what is RIGHT and what is EASY!And I will always remember the ones who gave their lives in this book to make the Witch & Wizarding world safe once more!A great read, I am planning to keep this as all the books in my collection for as long as I live. I will re read them all again and again.I wait for the MOVIES 6 and 7!THANKS! Nikki Jo"},

And the book not only meets the expectations, but exceeds them.The themes examined in this book are quite mature: how governments twist the truth, how newspapers and media, as the voice of the government, feed misinformation for all sorts of reasons, how trusted adults may have dark pasts and not-so-pure motives. We're past the \"simple\" issues of revenge and love and well into far more complex agendas.Many children's books (fairy tales) have clear sets of morals and well-defined heroes and enemies: the wicked stepmother, the beautiful princess, the knight in shining armor. This final volume is much more grey; the lines of black and white, good and evil, are not so clear-cut in this book. This is probably very unsettling for younger readers who need to feel secure in a world where grown-ups can be trusted. For more mature readers, this is a beautiful example of peeling back the layers of the onion of life. The series began with a very innocent view of the world, from the viewpoint of a young Harry Potter. As he aged and matured, so did our ability to see what was happening, and we saw his attempts to understand the reason for the actions of his teachers, his friends' parents, and other characters in his ever-expanding world.In Deathly Hallows, Harry is now an adult. He has turned 17, age of adulthood for wizards. He is no longer safe with his aunt and uncle, the protective spell now removed. He can take control of his own actions and path in life. As we all know (and maybe even learned the hard way), this is hardly the freedom that teenagers think it will be. That freedom to rule your own life brings the responsibility for how your actions will affect those around you, the ones that you care for. Harry's choices have a huge impact on Hermoine and Ron, and many, many others who valiantly stand by their friend.In one sense, Harry has been set on a path by Dumbledore, and perhaps all that happens is Dumbledore's fault. On the other hand, Harry has free will, and Dumbledore's instructions have always been vague at best. Harry has quite a range of choice in what he does and does not do. Almost every one of those choices are difficult at best.There are meditations here on the meaning of death and life, on the value of sacrifice. Every character has known pain and has made decisions for selfish reasons. There are celebrations of new beginnings, and there are some endings as well. These mediations shows up often in fine literature; this imagery has been around since mankind began civilization and it is an integral part of how our society works. It is central to this Deathly Hollows, and the book wouldn't be nearly as successful if Ms. Rowling didn't address these thoughts.People looking for non-stop high school hijinks and game competitions will be disappointed. This final novel has none of that. In fact, there are long stretches where the characters feel stymied, and it feels like no progress is being made. The book forces the reader to slow down, to think deeply about what is going on, to feel the strain and pressure of achieving extremely difficult goals. There are action sequences and well-described battles, but these are the exception, not the rule. Deathly Hallows is about intense internal struggles and deeply emotional challenges.The vocabulary reflects this as well. This book is not meant to be skimmed or jumped through. The wording and the sentence structure encourage the reader to go slowly, to contemplate, to think about what is being said. While Harry spends weeks contemplating issues and trying to figure out how he feels about an issue, the reader is encouraged to do the same. It's an adventure of self-exploration.As I already mentioned, the bar was set exceedingly high for this book. It was expected to be exactly perfect, a stunning work of literature appropriate for every age group. It was expected to satisfy both those who wanted a blockbuster \"Hollywood Ending\" as well as those who feel realism requires death, destruction, and bleak despair. While it did not quite achieve all of those goals (it came REALLY close), it is an outstanding book which has exposed millions of people to questions and issues they might not have otherwise encountered. It encourages people to think about the world they live in. You cannot ask any book to do much more than that."},

As Rowling turns her universe upside-down and reveals the past of a man who is fully accepted as the greatest wizard of all time, she reveals a character depth beyond belief. Dumbledore is made out to be a sinner, a villain, a God-like figure who does not stand in the way for an innocent sacrifice. He is good, but he is focused on the greater good, sacrificing individuals in order to achieve his goal. He loves Harry, heart and soul, but he still needs him dead. And worst of all? He has coldblodily known it all the time. While people has celebrated Snape's surprising sacrifice, I will always celebrate Dumbledore's betrayal. Purity and peace doesn't come without a price, and Dumbledore is willing to pay. He is a brilliant exception in Rowling's black-and-white universe. (view spoiler)[Along with Harry Potter of course. The part of Voldemort that lives in him reminds us that no one is pure. That we all hold a bit of evil U+2013 even though it has been attached to us by accidental spells and curses. (hide spoiler)]One thing that has been clear to me on rereading these books, is how black-and-white Rowling usually operates. Like the sorting hat, she conveniently divides her characters into good and evil and very few outsteps this path. I have always found it cowardly, how this book dismisses Slytherin-pupils for instance. An entire house of people, thrown out of the defining battle because they happen to be wearing green and silver. Rowling spends the entire series preaching how Slytherin isn't necessarily defined by evil U+2013 and yet, she chooses to dismiss them, when the fight is about to come. I've always hated it. I have always hated how the Slytherins in the end only seem to be allowed a single character trait. This time around, I also had a bit of trouble grasping the scope of Voldemort's evil. Is he about to destroy the universe? Will his rise to power mean the end of muggle-life? And if so, will it mean the end of every muggle in the world, or is his power restricted to Britain only? Why does the world not send help to fight him U+2013 why does the Order not include African, American or even European wizards? Voldemort's power and evil seems unlimited, and yet he is fought by an underground army consisting of Britains only, fighting the ultimate battle at a schoolground. I am confused by the perspective; Voldemort could rule the world, crush every offender U+2013 and yet he is at Hogwarts, fighting children. The suspense is however undeniable. We don't have time for so many strategic questions while reading this book, because it is nerve-wracking to read. Rowling makes you forget time and space U+2013 and even plot holes U+2013 as she drags you along for break-in's, wandlore, secret missions and treasure hunts for pieces of an evil soul.I have always loved the horcruxes and the psychological insight they provide into both Harry and Voldemort's soul. Little by little, you become fascinated with Voldemort's anger and his desire to be accepted, and you even come to understand the darkest corners of Harry's soul. While the treasure hunt itself is a bit tedious at times, its ultimate goal is breathtaking. However, as much as I've always loved the horcruxes, I've always hated the Deathly Hallows. It's puzzling why no one has ever mention Beedle the Bard earlier, as his tales are supposed to be the mythic pillars of the wizarding world. Why has Hermione, who has read about every book of wizardry, never stumbled upon these ancient tales U+2013 and why has Ron, who has grown up with these stories and loved them forever, never mentioned them? Why isn't there a magic frog card with Beedle the Bard? Why has Rowling never let a bit of the enthralling tales slip earlier? It's all so sudden. And to me, it's a bit implausible. As is wandlore itself.Wandlore is mythical, wonderful to read about, and impossible to understand. I'm still not sure about the whole allegiance thing; how exactly a wand's power is transferred or why. It's messy and I'd have loved a bit more explanation.But of course, I'd loved a bit more of everything. I love this book U+2013 mostly because of Dumbledore's character development (even beyond his death), and because it is so actionpacked and gratifying. Seven books, read in the dark with a galloping heart, and then this wonderful ending, where only a few characters are spared, and all are forever marked. This book may be filled with errors, but I am willing to overlook them. It is hard not to as these wonderful characters has been part of my life for so long.The Harry Potter-books are magical. And magic is hard to define. (view spoiler)[ A final note: I hate the ending relationships. This is perhaps more related to book six than book seven, but I've never understood Ginny and Harry. We get no explanation, no gradual falling-in-love process; suddenly Harry is in love with Ginny, while one moment earlier he wasn't. There was so much potential; so many scenes at the Burrow, Rowling could have used in order to build these feelings. Instead Harry falls in love out of jealousy.And then there's Ron and Hermione U+2013 another relationship enabled by hurt and jealousy. I can understand why Ron loves Hermione, but I can't understand why she loves him. He has been mean to her, ridiculing her, never appreciated her and even hinted she was ugly on several occasions. Would you fall in love with someone, who asked you out as a last resort, and loudly exclaimed that no one else wanted to go out with you? Would you fall in love with someone who got angry on the same occasion, because you actually went with someone else? Someone who ignored you, because he didn't appreciate you enough to ask? Someone who created an entire relationship with another girl, because he was jealous of a relationship you had before he had even shown interest in you? I think not. Ron is a lovely person, but he never treated Hermione well. At least not in my opinion. (hide spoiler)][Along with Harry Potter of course.

I kept being like, \"*Reads five pages* .... OKAY! Off to do something else.\" I guess because it was a little slow starting out. The first half of it was a lot of sitting around in the woods and being like *ARGUE ARGUE ARGUE* But, it got a lot better as it went along. I know J.K. Rowling did have to tie up a lot of things, so that's probably why it was so long and had so much information, etc.Anyway. So I read the second half of it in the car on a 2-hour ride home from Connecticut about a week ago. And toward the end it was getting dark outside, so I had to use my iPod as a flashlight and it was rather difficult and I was getting a headache. But I was like, \"MUST. FINISH.\" It was a good ending. Very satisfying. I've heard people complain about the ending being too happy and whatnot, but it wasn't really ... I mean, half the characters died. (Well, okay, not half. But a lot.) It was bittersweet. And heck, after all that crap he went through, HARRY POTTER DESERVES TO BE HAPPY.Blah blah blah. Still wracking my brain for things to say. I don't know. The thing is, the series was a bit ruined for me because I waited so long to read them; hence, I pretty much knew everything that was going to happen and was mentally/emotionally prepared for everything. So it's kind of hard to evaluate.UMMMM well. I know everyone says this but ... oh my gosh, this series has so much detail. As a writer I utterly fail at details. I'm like, \"I should probably explain this more. Nah. I should give this character some kind of backstory. Nah.\" Whereas, J.K. Rowling has some crazy detailed history for every single one of her characters. AGGGHHH. How did she write these books in less than a hundred years? There's a purpose for everyone and everything in these books. And evidently, she had the last book planned even when she was writing the first book. A lot of series fall flat on the planning aspect; they seem like the author says to his/herself, \"Meh, I don't have any other ideas so I'll just write some crappy sequel to that other thing I wrote!\" But with Harry Potter, there's a reason for every book, and for everything that happensU+2013 U+2013even the smallest details. Just .... GAHHH GAHHHHHH HHHAAHGKL;KLDJ. I don't know how to express my awe. It's not fair. I now feel the need to write 100-page outlines for everything I'm writing ... which I guess is a good thing. Anyway, so, the characters. Well, as I said, there's a reason for all of them. And they all have such cool backstories. Except Harry Potter is kind of annoying. And I wish Ginny had been more interesting and that Harry's interest in her hadn't been so random. But, whatevs. I like everyone else. Ron and Hermione are an adorable couple. Voldemort is really creepy (but I love his backstory). Dobby is awesome *cries*. And OHMYGOSH I love Snape. He's so cool. I was the most sad about his death. Especially afterward when you find out his whole backstory. He and Lily had such a sweet relationship. It was so sad. AGGGH. That was the only part that almost made me cry. (Don't get me wrong, a lot of other parts made me sad, it's just that books rarely make me shed actual tears.)Recently I read this thing on Cracked.com about how it would have been cool if it turned out Neville had been the Chosen One all along. Haha. That would've been kind of awesome. But oh well. The ending was still awesome. (This has nothing to do with anything, I just wanted to mention it.)Sorry this review has pretty much no thought or structure to it whatsoever. I'm just not sure how to sum up my thoughts on all seven books. I should read them again sometime to find any cool details I might have missedU+2013 U+2013now that I know everything that happens, yada yada. Right now I just feel kinda overwhelmed by the series as a whole though, so I probably won't be rereading them for a while. But anyway, they were great.I kind of wonder whether Rowling will ever write anything else. Maybe she's the Harper Lee type and only had one good story to tell. Also I feel like if she writes about anything else, everyone will be like, \"THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS HARRY POTTER.\" But, oh well. I'm sure the Harry Potter legacy will live on. People will keep reading these books to their kids. J.K. Rowling is probably set for life. So, WOOHOOOO!ONE MORE THING.I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.I just love saying that. :] Heh heh."},

Always.\"I've been staring at this blank box for over 10 minutes trying to think of a way to start reviewing the majesty of a book that was Deathly Hallows.There are truly too many emotions clouding my judgement at the moment, just give me a sec.First off I want to say that I'm utterly heartbroken, not only because this book was heartbreaking itself, but because I've just finished reading the Harry Potter series for the first time. I had seen the movies, many, many, MANY times, but I'd never picked up the books, don't ask me, I honestly don't know why. Now that it's over, I truly don't know what to do with myself, I'm so invested in this world, and in this story...to not have another book to look forward to is the most saddening thing. But, still, it was an indescribable experience, and I'm so glad I decided to start this journey back on September. I remember that I actually read Harry's first September 1st scene, on September 1st. I don't know why that brings me so much happiness. The coincidence made it feel like fate, and I DON'T CARE IF IT'S CHEESY, IT'S REAL.On to the good stuff: THIS BOOK WAS UNREAL. Everything, literally EVERYTHING was pure magic. Pun intended. This epic conclusion was, by far, the best series closer I've ever read in my life, nothing could beat this magnificent ending. Everything was so well explained, and thought-out, many loose-ends from other books were corrected in this conclusion, making every book essential, every pointless detail was taken into consideration, and made part of something bigger. That's where J. K. Rowling's true magic lies: being able to forge simple details and conversations into something so big, none of us could see it coming.Harry's, Ron's and Hermione's friendship was severely tested in this book, and their weaknesses were enhanced, so we got to witness the good, the bad, and the ugly that each character has, part because of the environment they endured for basically the whole book (being hunted 24/7, and having to live in the woods for a ridiculously long period of time) and because of the Horcruxes' effect. The whole deal with the Horcruxes was utterly fascinating, every aspect of it intrigued me, from Voldemort's fascination with conquering death, to how he came to know about the Horcruxes, to how he started making them, to the importance of his past, to the though-out locations where he hid them, to the effect they had on people, to how they had to be destroyed, and to the fact that he made a seventh unintended Horcrux that lived inside the boy he most desired to kill. The irony in all of it made me relish with amazement. Something I'd missed with the movies were the lengthy explanations that we get with the book, the explanations of why this Horcrux lived inside Harry, why he lived through two Killing Curses, and how Dumbledore wasn't truly the great man we thought he was.I'm not going to go into a lot of details about the book in case some of you haven't read it, or don't know what happens. Basically, I loved all of this:1. RON AND HERMIONE. -- this the book where Ron's actively trying to start things up with Hermione, with his love advice book at the beginning, and his distraught at Voldemort's Harry/Hermione ship (the scene when he destroys the Horcrux), and protecting her at EVERY moment. This book made Ron shine so much, through the ups and downs, we say an incredible, loyal man.2. HARRY AND GINNY. -- I mean. MUST I SAY MORE? I LOVE THEM.3. THAT EPILOGUE, MAN. -- Perfection. I do wish we'd gotten intel about what became of our three main characters: did Harry become an Auror? What did Hermione & Ron end up doing?4. The EPIC HOGWARTS BATTLE -- Neville. UGH what a SWEETHEART.5. EVERYTHING THAT HAD TO DO WITH HORCRUXES -- finding them, their locations, what they were, how to destroy them, their meaning, EVERYTHING.6. DEATHLY HALLOWS -- I ESPECIALLY loved the scene where they share the myth revolving the three objects.7. HAGRID -- THAT MAN KILLS ME. He's a sweetheart, and everything he does and says will always be beautiful to me. The scene where he has to carry Harry's body. Jesus. That scene is powerful. It brings everything full circle. 8. Kreacher's redemption: DEAR LORD, this elf was the death of me. I used to hate his GUTS, and in the movie, his redemption didn't happen, but in the book it did, and it was beautiful. He helped Harry, Ron & Hermione get one of the Horcruxes, and he had a hand in the final epic battle, where he led the elves against Voldemort's army.9. Dobby: Dobby was very painful. I can't quite put into words how much I loved this character and the sadness his ending caused me. 10. I LOVED the breaking into the Ministry's scene. EPIC. And breaking into Gringotts was SO MUCH FUN, Hermione's impression of Bellatrix was everything.11. SNAPE'S TRUTH: This was my absolute favorite part of the book. When we (FINALLY!) get to see his memories, and see how he's been protecting Harry all this time, was truly on our side, and beautiful his character actually was... He wasn't perfect. He wasn't a great guy. He had his flaws. But he was real. He was loyal, to a fault. He protected, even when sometimes he shouldn't. He was a magnificent character with an incredible arc, without a doubt my favorite character of all-time. Watching him during this book was heartbreaking, but the end was worth it. When Harry finally found out the truth...it was worth it. Silver doe. SILVER DOE. Enough said. I'm done. No more.12. \"Not my daughter, YOU BITCH\" -- epic.When Percy came back, to help in the Hogwarts battle... I broke down. I broke down BAD. And his stunning scene with Fred... where Perce made that joke. I still can't quite put into words how much it affected me. My heart breaks. Every time.As I said, this was an amazing experience, I can't wait to reread them, and then re-read all my reviews. It's been amazing.I really can't say more, I keep crying every time I write a new bullet, so I'm gonna go, watch the final two movies, and cry some more. If you're still here, thank you for reading. You're the best. "},

Unfortunately school got in the way and it took me almost an entire month to finish my reread, but overall the experience was pretty awesome.If you haven't read this series yet...um...I have nothing to say.Harry Potter 4eva! ;)"},

It doesn't follow Rowling's typical formula of following Harry's rule-breaking antics at Hogwarts and there is a crap ton of stuff that happens in this book. To read this book as a Harry Potter lover is a very emotional journey; it is truly heart breaking. For me, when this book first came out it marked the end of my childhood. I was in 5th grade when the first one came out and a freshman in college when this one finally hit shelves. My heart has never recovered from the ending of this series...I don't know where this ranks on my \"Harry Potter list\" because it's sort of an outlier to the series and it's a hard book to read (there should be a warning label that tissues are required). Here is my list of Harry Potter novels in order of my most favorite to my least favorite (for those who care...I guess! ha ha): 1.)Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince2.)Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire3.)Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban4.)Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix5.)Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone6.)Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets*Honorable mention - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (seriously I can't rank this one)What a journey it was re-reading these!

Of course I am talking about the millions of fans worldwide that found themselves holding the end of this story on their hands, after so many years, having conflicting emotions about it: on one hand, happiness for finally being able to see how Harry's story ends; on the other, the feeling of loss for having to say goodbye to so many \"friends\" in so little time. I think knowing that is what makes people read this book so avidly;Goodbye is the word that best describes this book, as I see it. Of course I am talking about the millions of fans worldwide that found themselves holding the end of this story on their hands, after so many years, having conflicting emotions about it: on one hand, happiness for finally being able to see how Harry's story ends; on the other, the feeling of loss for having to say goodbye to so many \"friends\" in so little time. I think knowing that is what makes people read this book so avidly; everything that happens to every character seems to matter tons more now than in any of the previous books, because now there's no more room for elaborate cliffhangers and twists and turns. If someone gets badly injured here, they are probably going to die. If someone goes missing, they are probably going to die too or it might be that they already have died. It's only natural that you don't want to see your favorite character gone, so you cling to the pages as if your life depends on it. Also, returning to Hogwarts is not an option for Harry anymore, since the castle is being run by, mostly, Voldemort's minions. Thus we also have to say goodbye to the idea of wandering our beloved corridors and secret passages, indefinitely, which kind of sucks.The bitterness of unwanted adios is not only experienced by us fans, though. Some of the characters find themselves on similar situations. The book already begins with Harry having to say goodbye to the home he was brought up in and also to the Dursleys (apparently the spell that made it impossible for Voldemort to reach him under their roof is going to expire as soon as he completes 17 years of age, so his not so friendly family is not safe anymore). I wouldn't believe if someone had told me how emotional things would get, especially regarding Dudley.Soon enough, knowing the burden that is laying onto Harry's shoulder and wanting to help him, Hermione and Ron also have to say goodbye to their families, for their quest must begin. The way Hermione has to deal with her parents in order to keep them safe is especially heart-breaking.Anyway, once the trio is out in the world searching for the horcruxes, things get increasingly bad. Being on the road with little or no clue what the next step is might be too much for some people; the feeling of desperation starts to seep into your veins until you don't know if what you're doing is worth it anymore. Despite the adversities, the group little by little starts getting some important information about Voldemort's past and, at some point, they start getting their hands on some horcruxes. It goes without saying that on every little step of their journey they have to worry about being caught by the Ministry, now that they are unwanted fugitives of the law, so every little task becomes ten times more difficult. I must say that they overcoming such serious hardships in the real world was very satisfying to see, I felt even proud of seeing how much stronger Harry, Ron and Hermione have become as individuals and also as friends.After some misadventures and major struggles they are finally led to Hogwarts, where some clues indicate that one of the remaining undamaged horcruxes is. Of course, at this point, Voldemort and his gang are well aware of their attempts on finding every single horcrux, so from the point when Harry, Ron and Hermione get to Hogwarts they have to fight their way into the castle and take it back. The following chapters are just breathtaking; it's just surprise after surprise, not only about Voldemort's past but also about Harry's and his parents'. All this events culminate with an epic battle such as I've never read in any other story. So, yeah, take it, World, I find the best action scene ever written was made by a woman.Gender favoritism aside, it is a wonderful book that makes justice to all the years of supporting this series. All the lose ends planted years ago were very well put together, there's nothing left out or poorly executed. I just love it, so it was very hard when the time came to finish reading the last paragraph and say goodbye.  Interesting quotes that I didn't include in the review:  Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it."},

JJuly 2009After my second reading of this book, I have so many more feelings and comments about it than I did after the first reading. But I think those comments mainly deal with the series as a whole, rather than just this book, and this book (being the conclusion of the saga) just brings some of the brilliance of the entire series more fully into focus. I may take a page from Madeleine's book and write a review of the entire series. I also think that this is a series I could read once a year. July 2007Wow. I cannot believe it's over! This book was an absolute emotional roller coaster. I don't even know where to start so I'm just going to list some random thoughts:1. I am exceedingly happy (and surprised) that the trio survived. I was sure Ron or Hermione was going to die. In the scene where Bellatrix is torturing Hermione, I thought that was going to be it and I was pissed that Ron never got the chance to tell her how much he loved her. 2. Along those same lines, I didn't really like how LONG it took Ron and Hermione to finally get together. I understand this is war, and there were more pressing things on their minds than dating, but they escaped death so many times that I thought they'd declare their love for each other out of the heat of the moment. It was cute how, once Ron finally embraced Hermione's passion for S.P.E.W., she lays one on him.3. The death of Dobby was very sad. But Dobby would have wanted to die saving Harry Potter. This was not the first time he risked everything to come to Harry Potter's aid. I think it'll be harder for me to read the second time, though, The first time, I was so worried that Hermione was going to die that it numbed the pain of Dobby's death. But the funeral scene was very sad.4. I was very saddened by Fred's death, but I wasn't altogether surprised. I never thought that all of the Weasleys would survive, and I figured it would be Fred or George. I was really happy to see Ginny, Hagrid, and Neville live. I was also sad about Tonks and Lupin, but I think it's intersting that Harry's godson was orphaned in the fight to defeat Voldemort just as Harry was. It'll definitely give Harry some insight into his godson's feelings. But my question is, who raised him? Clearly, he didn't grow up living with Harry, so did he get raised by Tonks' mother? 5. My \"Yay for you!\" character moments: Dudley shaking Harry's hand. Mrs. Weasley calling Bellatrix a bitch. Percy redeeming himself. NEVILLE stepping up and becoming a full-on leader with the DA, and then drawing the sword out of the hat and killing Nagini, allowing Harry to defeat Voldemort once and for all!6. I wish we'd have had a few more clues throughout the series as to Dumbledore's past. I never even knew he had a sister, did anyone else? Even just a passing mention of her somewhere... I understand now why Dumbledore had to die. I mean, I knew it would have something to do with Harry needing to go it alone, but it was more than that. Had Dumbledore been around for Harry to ask about the Deathly Hallows, I think things would have turned out differently.7. Voldemort's arrogance was his undoing. He was too arrogant to think there would be more to the prophecy, so he went after baby Harry, thereby fulfilling his own prophecy and equipping Harry with his own power, his own soul. He was arrogant enough to think that Harry's blood in his own veins would give him Lily's protection without giving Harry any ties to him. He was arrogant enough to think that his own wand would work against Harry, arrogant enough to think Lucius' wand would work against Harry, arrogant enough to think he could just steal the Elder Wand without earning it.8. Let the Christ/Messiah comparisons continue: not only did Harry willingly sacrifice himself for all of mankind, but he even was, in a way, resurrected.9. Didn't Rowling say that a non-magic person would use magic late in life? Who was it? DId I miss something?10. And finally... SNAPE! I knew he was good, I knew it, I knew it!! Brent and I had just discussed Snape carrying a torch for Lily. Brent even called it that Voldemort was going to spare Lily because Snape asked him to, and that when Lily died, Snape left Voldemort forever. I was disappointed that we learned all about Snape at the end, though, I would have liked to find out little by little, and have Harry piecing it together. I guess this way was more dramatic though. I definitely teared up when Harry named his son Albus Severus and told him that Severus Snape was probably the bravest man he ever knew."},

And even harder thatI just wanted to say that I loved it and it exceeded all my expectations. I know most people finished their books weeks ago, but I didn't have that luxury with everything else I had going on this summer. The Girl and I decided that we wanted to reread some of the more recent books and we thought it'd be neat if we did it together. So, with her hard cover copy we read aloud the 6th book, beginning it the night we bought the 7th. Yes, it was hard not starting that right away. And even harder that I was reading it out loud, since that would take more time. But it was a whole lot more fun. I would do all the voices and inflections. I even did some of the voices with their accents (not all, my British Isles accents are limited). Of course, at the end of the 6th and several times during the 7th, I had to close the book and try to compose myself. I'm a guy and should never been seen weeping. Especially from reading! Now, if I were kicked in the nuts or my favorite team lost or my life long dog died, then it would be acceptable to openly weep. Definitely not from a book. So I had to read a line and I would see the next line and I'd have to take a few moments, while The Girl was agonized. She would exclaim, \"Well? What happened?\" And I would see what happened. I could see the next few lines. But I just couldn't say them aloud just yet. It was quite emotional. And just a few short years ago, I couldn't stand anything Harry Potter. Of course I hadn't read any of the books or seen any of the movies. I just didn't like the mass hysteria surrounding it. So I avoided it. And then people I trusted and respected began to scoff at me. The couldn't understand why I hadn't joined the Harry Potter bandwagon. The promised me that if I made it through the first two books, I would love the third. So I picked up the first book and read it in a day. I thought it was cute. I picked up the second book. And read it in a day. I thought it was cute. Then I picked up the third book. And read it in a day. I thought it was good. No. Really good. This was no Scooby Doo with magic adventure anymore. This actually had a larger story. After that, I read all the books, watched all the movies and had my own sort of theories about what was going to happen in the last book. I made my own death list (people sure to die). I made my survivor list (people sure to live). And finally The Girl and I read the last book. Of course, I went in with high expectations, but with a realistic goal of being mildly disappointed. Isn't it always the case that anything and everything that you highly anticipate never reaches the level that you thought it'd be. The last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was everything I wanted from the ending to the series. I laughed. I (almost) cried. I smiled all through it at the joy of reading it. If you haven't yet gotten into Harry Potter, move out of the cave and go to a bookstore. This is a bandwagon that I'm not ashamed to have jumped on."},

Aside from the fact that it completely transported me away from real life, to the point that people were actually worried about me, it's quite simply a huge accomplishment. It gives a feeling of change throughout the years that makes me feel as if my existence had changed, as if I had been through such life-altering experiences.I've grown with these characters, I've felt what they've felt, I've seen every little change or adventure they've been through, and now that it's over, I feel as if I'd just been ripped apart limb from limb.I'm going to actually be mourning those who have died in this war."},

K. Rowling casting a Confundus Charm on every reader of hers to end this book, then to close it whispering to themselves   \" Woah \" .The themes of true friendship , genuine love and self-sacrifice are so touching , it portrays how false pride ,hunger for power and selfishness always go hand in hand with evil , even in the noblest of characters . i love that Kreacher was the one who led the house elves in their fight in the Hogwarts battle , isn't it one more powerful message of Rowling's books ? that people change if we change our attitude toward them , this series believes in second chances , in true everlasting love , believes that people are actually good at heart .And even with the final book in the series ,the one where Rowling was unlikely to surprise us, she pulls up her sleeves and writes a most incredible sequel to her previous 6 books , the awaited moment when Harry is expected to step out at forefront of the battle , to kill the Lord Voldmort and survive as he always did with a most unexpected skill, Rowling chooses not to walk down that tried and predictable path . Instead, harry's survival is to be seized this time by the acceptance of his own death , from the bravery not in fighting his way through battles but in the self-sacrifice. she shows again that the power of love is to overcome any other .It breaks my heart that no sock is efficient to free Dobby from the grasps of death , it breaks my heart that Sirius, Lupin , Tonks and Dumbledore are no more , it breaks my heart that Snape had never showed the best of him , his winningly helplessly genuinely beating heart , it breaks my heart that for George every mirror would ever be the mirror of Ersid .But, yet, I am to borrow Jhon Green's words \" it would be a privilege to have my heart broken by you \" . oh,yes . most definitely.This series means too much to me. maybe i feel like it took me too long to start reading the books , it doesn't even make sense , may be i even feel a little bit ashamed and confused about this fact , but since i was eleven , since that very year in which i watched the first harry potter movie for the first time ever and bought that schoolbag with Harry, Ron and Hermione faces on it , i loved it , I canU+2019t fully articulate it. It just is so special and it feels weird that all these people around the world share my very same passion . I've always loved that world ,but now i do more profoundly , from a place much deeper much more sincere in my heart , i love it still and i will always do .\"After all this time?Always.\""},

To maintain any sense of plausibility you have to bury the groundwork for the end in something the reader already thinks they understand, such as what happened the night Harry got his scar.Michael FraynU+2019s Copenhagen explores the uncertainty of memory in great detail. How a larger context (WWII) can warp it with equal direction, how difficult it can be for two people to reconstruct the simplest details such as where they walked and for how long. At a minimum the play leaves you with the idea that you can never know something with absolute precision, and that knowing isnU+2019t as important as keeping that awareness in the back of your mind. Worst case, it means I can write whatever I want to fit whatever ending IU+2019ve concocted, and nobody can say IU+2019ve contradicted myself or that IU+2019m just making this nonsense up on the fly, because the facts are in a constant state of distortion.So now Voldemort is Harry, Harry is Voldemort.

Bellatrix flinging her knife to kill a disapparating house elf, after letting Harry and Co walk all over her and all her lame henchmen, is bullshit.But beyond that, although I can understand how you donU+2019t want Harry or the reader to know that the elder Dumbledore is involved, killing Dobby to safeguard your plot contrivance for less than one hundred more pages is a savage weakness.

People say thereU+2019s no greater love than to lay down your life for your friends, but I say dying is the easy way out. Snape gave up his soul, his bloodline, and his reputation, even after she became Lily Potter, and though itU+2019s sad he had to die, he doesnU+2019t strike me as a person who could ever have been happy with life afterwards. Again, a little twisted, a little predictable, and he didnU+2019t take anyone with him, but still a good death.19.

What choice will he make?ENJOYMENT FACTOR:I started this over a year and a half ago and hated it so much I left it unfinished 1/3 of the way. I finally coerced myself to finish it before seeing the final HP movie. I didnU+2019t hate it as much the 2nd time around (I think the loathing may have been partly due to the bad taste that Book 6 left in my mouth) and despite myself I enjoyed the story (for the most part). Rowling fleshes out her characters, showing the good and bad in them (prime example: Dumbledore). Rowling also aces at raising the stakes, shrouding the plot in mystery, getting her characters in trouble and out again. The plotline is convoluted and it sags heavily in the middle but the secrets kept this reader plodding along.WRITING STYLE:RowlingU+2019s love of adverbs borders on the obscene. The greatest affront is in the last chapter:Harry to his son: U+201CAlbus Severus, you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I have ever known.U+201DReally, Rowling? Snape worked as a double-agent to the two most powerful wizards at great personal cost, duped Death Eaters and Order members alike, endured the hate and distrust of all, sacrificed his life for love, and HARRY CANU+2019T EVEN BE FREAKING SURE that he was the bravest!??!Fortunately the movieU+2019s scriptwriters promptly fixed this oversight.OTHER OBSERVATIONS (The X Factor):As I watched the movie soon after finishing the book, itU+2019s difficult for me to divorce the two. I LOVED the movie. If only for those 5 minutes of SnapeU+2019s memories in the pensieve, the most moving performance I have seen in recent years. (All hail Alan Rickman!) I know people are complaining about all the revisions, but I actually appreciated most of the things they changed in the movie. They cut out the plodding (and unnecessary parts), focused on the meat and bones, and fixed all the inconsistencies and awkward plotting I noticed in the book. For example:1)tRavenclawU+2019s diadem (a horcrux) was accidentally destroyed in the book by Fiendyre. The explanation being that the cursed fire was so potent it was one of the few things that could destroy a horcrux. Sorry but I donU+2019t buy that. If so, Harry and co. shouldnU+2019t have wasted their time and energy looking for a magical object (Sword of Gryffindor) to destroy the horcrux when they could have used their energies to learn the Fiendfyre curse instead. They fixed this in the movie by using a Basilisk fang to destroy the horcrux instead of Fiendfyre.2)tIn the book I had no idea how Neville pulled the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat U+2013 wasnU+2019t it stolen by Griphook? The movie makes this clearer. 3)tI liked the scene where Harry realizes what he MUST do to defeat Voldemort (I believe itU+2019s the climax of the entire series), but I found HarryU+2019s face-off with his archnemesis cheesy to the point of being ridiculous. He duels with the most murderous and evil Wizard in history in full view of the entire school because, as he tells Voldy: U+2019I sacrificed my life for them so now theyU+2019re immune to you. You canU+2019t hurt them!U+2019 I understand the rationale (same principle as his motherU+2019s sacrifice) but that doesnU+2019t stop me from rolling my eyes. They fixed this in the movie by moving the duel in a private area with no spectators and not giving anyone U+2018magic immunityU+2019. (Although I doubt if the light saber rays shooting from the duelersU+2019 wands was an improvement).4)tThe plot point of an Ultimate Elder Wand didnU+2019t sit well with me. I thought by this time Harry and Voldemort would face off in a true test of skill U+2013 I expected something along wandless magic. But why bother when you can win by technicality and have an Elder Wand to Rule Them All (a.k.a. deus ex machina). Unfortunately this plot hole was beyond the scope of the movie to fix.That said, I think the book and movie complement each other perfectly. The movie highlights the best parts and improves on the story, while the book gives a thorough explanation of everything. COMMENT ON THE HP SERIES AS A WHOLE:RowlingU+2019s greatest achievement is in creating memorable, distinctive characters and a magical world readers would want to live in again and again. I remember being struck with awe when I read Book One nearly a decade ago. However, I found RowlingU+2019s stories increasingly diluted and un-enjoyable from Book 4. Not because of the dark tone, but because the convoluted plot lines made it harder to figure out the true story beneath. Coincidentally, this was also the time Rowling probably fired her editor and her books afflicted with elephantiasis syndrome.My major disappointment with the series, however, is the uselessness of its main character. Harry Potter never improved in his abilitiesU+2014 his achievements are from pure luck and genetics. He doesnU+2019t study, he doesnU+2019t practice, he doesnU+2019t make the effort. Even his questionable talents in wizardry and Parseltongue could be directly attributed to Voldemort. Harry Potter is mediocre, and remained a mediocre pawn of Dumbledore all through out."},

(I promise!)Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is by far, my favorite book of the entire series. Hands down. I'm very, VERY happy I come to the end of the series, but also sad since the series is over now. It was my 2012 summer goal and I have finally accomplished it! With help and support from my dear friends, Keertana, Jordyn, Inge, and Olivia, they all convinced me to keep reading the series and assured me that the series will keep getting better and it did! This book changed me...It had changed me in a postive way. It's one of those books that changed me and make a lasting impression upon your life. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows suprised me, made me laugh, and made me weep silent tears for an hour. There's never a single book that can changed me and I'm proud to say this is the 1st life-changers book. Why didn't I read this sooner?! Everybody gave raving and positive reviews on it, but crazy me ignored it. I'm very happy that I read the entire series. It has been one hell of a ride! :D I predict in the future when I'm old and wrinkly, I will still read this series over again and again...The characters again were smart, cunning, and well-developed from beginning to end. Lots of tragic deaths has occured in this book which will impacted lots of readers, but I'm not going to name names because it will spoiled the story for those who haven't read the series. My favorite character would have to be Snape besides Harry and his friends. I finally get to see his good/evil intentions present in the last installment. The word \"Always\" that Snape said had shown a new light in its name. This finale shows us that even the evil (bad) guys have good intentions as well and can be refer as the good guy in some cases. Snape is one of them. The ending to the book was spectacular and unforgettable to a remarkable series. The action was fast-paced and very addicting. You will find in no time you'll finish this book sooner than expected! Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is just so epic! :) Enough, said.Overall, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is a phenomenal. It will always engages readers and give us a sense of belonging and emotions that follow with it. I will never forget this series because it had brought possiblities to a new light and changed me in a very, very good way. (I'm almost certain it will change others as well) And for that, I will always be eternally grateful. Thank you, J.K Rowling, for writing such a phenomenal series, one that readers all over the world will never forget and will treasure beyond all else....P.S Plus, a box of tissues would be helpful to read this book....:(I STRONGLY encourage reading this series if you HAVEN'T AlREADY! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!And last, my contribution to Snape...(Thanks Snape.)______________________________________If you want to read my previous reviews of 1st-6th books of Harry Potter, just click the link below.-Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone's review -Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets's review-Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban's review-Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire's review -Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix's review-Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince's review"},

They break into the Ministry, they revisit Godric's Hollow, they obtain the sword of Gryffindor, but mostly they just relocate, camp in the woods, and try to interpret the intentions of the dead and departed, or deal with their legacies by interpreting the artifactual evidence they left behind. Regulus and the locket; Grindewald and Dumbledore and the fragments of their story indirectly derived from Belinda Bagshot; Lily's letter to Sirius; the deer patronus; the anonymous missives of support left at the grave of Harry's parents in Godric's Hollow; learning about the DA and the Order through the Potterwatch broadcasts, etc.One example of this was the scene at the Lovegood's, when Harry discovers Luna's private mural of himself, Ron, Hermione, Neville, and Ginny, intertwined with a golden ribbon of the word \"friends\" repeated over and over. There were some other important narrative elements introduced in this scene, and some action, but the description of this mural had me tearing up. As I read that passage, Luna transformed from an adorably oblivious but ultimately irrelevant side character to this formerly lonely, abandoned human being for whom the DA's friendship was as novel as it was profoundly essential. And I was actually filled with grief that Harry learned this too late, that this crisis was exposing the unbreakable strength underlying all Harry's friendships too late to acknowledge and cherish those bonds for what they were worth. Except... it wasn't too late, because Luna and many of the others were still alive, and still fighting. So why did I feel like they were dead? This brought to mind a passage from Netherland (which I now feel more inclined to finish):An ancient discovery was now mine to make: to leave is to take nothing less than a mortal action. [...] after Mama's cremation I could not rid myself of the notion that she had been placed in the furnace of memory even when alive and, by extension, that one's dealings with others, ostensibly vital, at a certain point become dealings with the dead.For me, this cast the middle section of the book in a completely new light. Now it became an examination of the way the departed, both dead and alive, continue to touch us and affect our lives through the memories and thoughts they leave behind. In Netherland, O'Neil was pointing out the tragedy of this, how even the living can become as distant from us as the dead, but I think Rowling wants the reader to see this as a profoundly important part of being alive, that seeking out and understanding these kinds of evidence makes bearable the void left by the absent. The influence of the dead is important throughout this book and throughout this series, but in this seemingly humdrum plateau of the novel, I think it becomes paramount.There are lots of other incoherent things I could blather on about, mostly the difference between self-sacrifice and martyrdom and the merits of happy endings, but this review is approaching the edge of \"long\" with \"pointlessly long\" well in sight, so I'll finish. I loved this book as I love the whole series, and its existence has made my life better."},

As a whole, with this series, JKR has created a cast of characters and a world that I know I won't forget anytime soon. Fortunately, I was able to grow up with Harry Potter, so this entire phenomenon that she has created is like home to me, in much the same way that Hogwarts was like a home to Harry.

'is snape good or bad?' 'what if hogwarts burns to the ground and everyone dies?!' and furthermore, 'how long would it take for spoilers to come out in the media and from random mean people?'The book didn't arrive on my doorstep till the following week 'cause I chose free shipping at amazon, but miraculously enough I avoided all spoilers. the ones on my newsletter were easy enough by just scrolling real fast with my hand on the monitor as the thread appeared and disappeared. this easy avoidance of spoilers had me worried the book had no thrills whatsoever. especially reading enough at first to know people liked the book. no one would like if Harry were dead.I was not one of those fast readers who finished it in about one second. no, it took me about four days which is a miracle to me. I fell asleep a lot during the camping phase of the story... well, at least till Harry had to jump in and get the sword and Ron showed back up. that made me loosen up a bit.. become one with the characters again. for awhile, it was just a surface read. see, I also wasn't one of the ones who reread the old books before starting, so I really needed a refresher on some of the lesser characters thus stopped in the midst of reading several times to google this info. at least I read enough threads from those who did read the other books over again, to keep certain clues in mind for the big finale.Towards the end, when things heated up, I got a tad worried for Harry 'cause his death would seem courageous and the whole walking ghosts beside him through the woods bit really brought a tear to my eye.. this would be acceptable to all who read if he died this way, right? I thought about having to walk in (since it was around 6am by this time) with a tear in my eye to say Harry died. this idea sounded pathetic, but c'mon, climatic bit! too early to still be awake and reading! the Dumbledore appearance in 'his head'! (I liked this line most of all: \"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\" mom constantly tries to tell me that there isn't a difference between your inner world and your outer world.. what's the difference? what difference would it make if all life were just one big dream? anyway, I won't get too philosophical with this, but beyond what certain people may've thought about how Dumbledore was brought back to talk to Harry -- I had read this wasn't necessary -- I really enjoyed it)So yes, it may've been a bit weak to bring Harry back from possible death, but I'd rather Harry live and get his happy ending than naught. I mean, who would've defeated Voldemort otherwise?One small issue I had--though I am happy I got the Trust Snape sticker at Borders.. I knew better!-- was that Snape wasn't brought to rest at the end. he was just left apparently at Whomping Willow. does this mean he could possibly still be alive? ..the epilogue kind've proves otherwise though. I felt after all he did, he deserves more respect than just to have a namesake. I felt the most compassion for him during 'The Prince's Tale' chapter especially.Beyond that, I didn't regret reading it (since I didn't really have any real wants and needs beyond the quality of the writing) or throw it across the room as apparently some people did (wtf?). one day I'll reread all the books again since I hear it's fun to see how connected they all really are. I think that's brilliant. this is the best children's / YA series I've ever had the chance of reading and am glad I picked it up when I did even if I didn't grow up with Harry."},

It's tied with a lot of people's childhood or first read series and I have read a bunch of series by now and yeah, I loved it but I'm not gonna be like \"I misss it so much\" because I just read it.Because also I read Chronicles of Narnia last year and  I hated it. It's older and it has many different things with HP but it's like one of those series. The characters were so stupid, seriously but instead in this series I found flawed, heart-warming, hard-not-to-love characters. That's probably why I loved it the most because J.K rowling really gave some reality to her characters and understood them.It was better than I expected-- even though my expectations were high--- but one thing I didn't expect was 1) That I wouldn't like the movies as much after it. It just never went through my head.2) That I'd be shipping Ron and Hermione and Harry and Ginny. When I saw the last movie and saw that Ron and Hermione kiss it was a big WTF for me, it was like out of nowhere in my head. it makes more sense when you read the books but you didn't see it that much on the movies. I was like: But Harry and Hermione...? (There's like nothing between them in the books.) I didn't mind Harry and Ginny that much but now I just really ship them.There are probably more things I'd like to say about it but I just can't think of anything right now but it was as good as promised."},

It is so good every time that after it, I just need to stay away from every other book for a while because well, nothing is like Harry Potter.

The book has everything: suspense, adventure, struggle, deceit, loss, and most of all retribution!

The final showdown, at least for me. The final review and the finish to my self-imposed Harry Potter summer challenge. Much like many people, I read the whole series, only in my case, it wasn't in preparation for the movie. Rather, it was me finally coming back to finish what I started ten years ago with these books.And what's the final verdict?It wasn't so bad.*total outrage*Yes, yes, I imagine you expected me to spew venom all over the place, or, maybe you didn't and are now sniggering at my having fallen, once again, under Rowling's spell.To both camps: KEEP YOUR SHORTS ON, I'm not finished.Yes, it wasn't so bad. For instance, we finally, finally, finally see some character development in Harry, and even the Ron/Hermione romance wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. SNAPE! NEVILLE! DRACO! Those three alone are enough of a motivation for anyone to read the series. In fact, I'd like to point them out as examples of how to write good male characters. Alyson Noel, take note!And yes, I was also very much emotionally vested in these characters. I loved all of them, and how wonderfully they interact. I was pleasantly surprised with Percy, who experienced some very impressive character development, as well as Dumbledore, who finally got knocked off his pedestal and was shown, rather, like a character and not some flawless Yoda-like saint. That said, there are shortcomings in this book. In fact, some of its greatest strengths are also its greatest weaknesses.#1 HarryAlright, so we finally get to see the Boy Who Lived to Be a Pain in the Arse to evolve into a character. I loved how Harry grew more responsible in this book, and how he learned that sometimes you have to do what you have to do. My question, though, is this: Why did it take him six and a half books to get there? I know he grows throughout the series, but it's only in this one where he drops the whining and mans up. In a way, throughout the series, he's very much a child, even with all the ordeals he has experienced.#2 Ron/HermioneI still maintain that Hermione is a superior character to both Harry and Ron. I mean, for the love of God, she (view spoiler)[ removes herself from her parents' memories just to keep them safe, and doesn't break down, even when she's being tortured  (hide spoiler)]. Not to mention the dozens of times she has saved everyone's lives, and how she focuses on the bigger picture instead of on her own feelings when the situation calls for it. Rowling really worked on making the romance between Ron and Hermione more believable in this book, but much like Harry, it comes about six and a half books too late. And don't tell me Ron was a prat to her because it's in the character of teenage boys and they bonded through trauma - if that's the case, then explain the epilogue (which I will get to in a minute).#3 DumbledoreSo in book 6 we were seeing the cracks in Dumbledore's saint-like image, but it's not until book 7 that we get a glimpse of the man that he really was. I loved this development, as it showed a lot about his motivation and past.As for the matter of Dumbledore's homesexuality... I admit I was sceptic when I heard it first. Now that I read the book, I think I kinda see it. There is definitely something there, and I can also see it couldn't really be obvious - at the time, it was very unlikely that Dumbledore could have acted on his feelings, and then afterwards... yeah.Now that I read it, I realize Rowling couldn't have elaborated on that aspect of Dumbledore because that's not the point of the series. The point of the series is the power of love and humanity over evil, not the romantic subplots. Although, again, that doesn't fit in with the epilogue, which I will get to... eventually.#4 The Amount of Hammy Deaths in the BookWhere do I begin with this? Okay, you know how Mockingjay is sometimes referred to as 'tragedy porn'? Well, this book borders on it. I mean in the first fifty pages, the owl dies. THE OWL DIES! Right after Harry gives her a nice tour down memory lane. I mean, poor Hedwig![image error] Um, not that one, but... actually... yeah, poor Hedwig. And that's not even the worst of it. The battle for Hogwarts, in its own right, is as horrible as it comes. The deaths of so many wonderful characters (view spoiler)[ Oh, Lupin! Oh, Tonks! Oh, Colin!!! Oh, FRED!  (hide spoiler)] alone are enough to bring tear to the eye. A friend of mine accused me once of wishing some character or another had died in the place of another, and I guess that's not wholly fair because even the most annoying ones shine during the battle. But... some of those deaths were so grisly, and then followed by a moment that was supposed to be... cute? (view spoiler)[ One moment, we have Lavender being savaged by a werewolf, and in the next, Treloni is killing Death Eaters by tossing spheres! What. The. Fuck!  (hide spoiler)] How is this even remotely acceptable? What was Rowling going for with this? I've heard people say that the series grew with the books, but this? Are we trying to write REALISTICALLY here? Because... um...#5 The PlotholesRowling's clearly not squeamish about killing off her characters. And she's not afraid of making the series dark. So why the hell is Harry alive? There was this huge buildup towards a heroic sacrifice which would save the whole world, and then we get this ridiculous cop-out that is so convoluted I'm not even going to try and get in to. Of course, it allows us a whole chapter where Dumbledore's ghost explains everything to our clueless hero, who, instead of letting his feelings run free and telling him to go fuck himself, forgives him nicely and goes back to the land of the living. And so on, and so on. If I went back to explain every plothole of this book, we'd be here till tomorrow. My point is, this victory seems to be based on quite a lot of nice little conveniences. I mean, how nice of Harry to explain how he's won to Voldemort right before he kills him, or that his self-sacrifice (even if he never died) protected the whole frickin' school!#6 The EpilogueHow many people have complained about this? Can't count? Neither can I? So we get this victory which came along through the bloody sacrifice of so many, and then, nineteen years later, our heroes are living the dream, with children and white picket fences? Really?Say what you will about the ending of Mockingjay, but at least it was sensitive to the trauma of war and the horrors the heroes went through. The Deathly Hallows is a tale of pain and loss which ends with an overly cute pink bow on top. Like Severus Lawliet said in her review, where's the emotional scarring? Hermione was tortured in the same manner as Neville's parents. Did Bellatrix just not have enough time to scar her permanently? I realize that all this makes me look like a... rather unpleasant person. Yeah... But I just don't get what Rowling was going for with this book. Did she want the series to grow from one genre to another, like her characters? From a fun children's book to a dark, fantasy epic? Is the story really that realistic? Dragons and goblins and magic aside, I mean. I see the merits of her book. I'm just saying that if she went through the trouble of setting up a tragic ending, maybe she should have gone through with it. So that was the end of my little HP challenge. What do I think of the series as a whole? Decent. I'm sure it'll go down as a children's classic. And, as with most classics, it's best not read too much into it.Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll go read some happy endings.SnapeLupin and TonksDraco and Hermione[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[\"br\"]>[ removes herself from her parents' memories just to keep them safe, and doesn't break down, even when she's being tortured  (hide spoiler)][image error][ Oh, Lupin!

And I feel empty. Hogwarts it truly my home. This story is a precious part of me, as real as any other experience. I believe it will stay with me forever. It's not perfect, of course it's not, but to us that grew up alongside those characters it's special.If you wish to read some of my random thoughts on this book, go there: http://anhec.booklikes.com/post/75043...Here I'll mention only two things.Neville: that one is beyond words. I think there's a bit of Neville living in each one of us. He's a true underdog of the story. He's scared, full of doubts, doesn't believe in himself, tries to meet the expectations of family and teachers, but always falls short. He can never quite measure up. Always insecure, always struggling. And yet he knows the difference between right and wrong and is willing to fight for it. To die for it. He knows who he is, who he wants to be. He finds his strength, he finds passion, he finds what he's good at and makes friends. The way he wasn't willing to compromise and stood up to his friends (after risking first a lot to warn them) is commendable. That is something Lupin didn't know how to do. He's got what young Dumbledor was missing. Ron, George, Harry... they all lose the sight of their goal, of priorities upon witnessing death and tragedy. What does Neville do? What Harry asked him to. He stands up to Voldemort and in this precarious situation, with a burning hat on his head, when he's about to die, he kills the snake. He decides to do what Harry asked him to do even if it's the last thing he'll do in his life, even though he has no idea why was it important at all. Harry wanted to know, needed to know 'why'. He felt entitled to this knowledge.The more I think about Neville the more I love and admire him. \"In a world of leaders and followers, there are some who donU+2019t attempt to fit either mold, and it is those distinct few who really determine the future of us all. That is what Neville Longbottom can teach us.\"Snape: do I even have to tell you? He isn't a good guy - he's an asshole with serious anger management problems. Does he love Lily? Yes and no, he's kind of obsessed, but she always represented something good in his life. It's not empty. Is he, as a young man, compassionate at all? Pff, nope. Does he change completely? NO! He hates Harry! To the very end! He's not angry abut the boy dying, but about feeling cheated out of his purpose in life! Something he was holding on to. Or is he? We never truly know! We don't ever learn the whole truth about him; we can only guess and assume. This is one of the most wonderfully complex characters I've ever encountered. You kind of hate him, but also admire his determination and dedication. Not to mention - you feel sorry for him, sorry for a boy that grew emotionally far, far too late. But in his twisted way he cared, he cared about the Order of the Phoenix, he cared about Dumbledore, he cared about the difference between right and wrong (after years of growing and changing, but still, he got there). What he did... It's beyond comprehension. Harry was ready to die, but before that he had lived. People knew him, loved him. Snape gave up EVERYTHING, ended up alone and despised, carrying great responsibility on his shoulders. I hope the extent of Snape's sacrifice was appreciated in the end. I really do."},

Voldemort's complete lack of menace and dignity. He's soaring around the skies trying to curse Harry? He's also forgotten that Harry can access his mind - in fact, in this book Harry actually reads Voldemort's thoughts which is something he never could do before and is extremely convenient, to say the least. 4.

Really, it underscored what a pathetic sap Ron is - it didn't feel like him overcoming anything, just like him continuing to be a useless, sad sap. Speaking of which 'All's fair in love and war'? Rolling my eyes. Go away, Ron.6. Ron opening the Chamber of Secrets? It's an old bathroom. If random hissing sounds could open the chamber, it would have happened before now.7. The cheap deaths in this book. I call them cheap because they were just pointless sacrifices to underscore that shit was getting real without actually meaning anything or making sense with that character's plotline - apart from Dobby, really. You look at the deaths and a random Weasley, Tonks, Lupin, Ted Tonks, Madeye, Hedgwig? 8. Umbridge's return. So improbable given that she was Fudge's number 2 and no one would want her back & given that her ending in OOTP was actually imo, perfectly resolved.9. The break-in at Gringott's was underwhelming for something that the reader has been anticipating since PS.10. There should have been more dragons. Charlie's whole thing is dragons. Dragons. 11. Voldemort's goals make no sense at all. Even for a megalomaniac. Also his obsession with Hogwarts really makes him a pathetic villain.12. The focus on Dumbledore's backstory - last book it was people trying to reconstruct Voldemort's soap opera of a life and in this book it's Dumbledore, and what a waste of time. Also it's so ridiculous that JKR didn't put Dumbledore's affair with Grindelwald in the book. She had the perfect opportunity to plant even a small suspicion of that with Rita Skeeter's book and chose not to. 13. Percy's comeback made no sense. Percy is the only Weasley I've ever liked and I wanted him obviously to stop being pro-Ministry, but Aberforth became very deus ex machina.14. Everything about Lupin.15. Snape. Enough said.16. That the SPEW plot culminates in Ron and Hermione kissing instead of anything meaningful.17. That Harry is still mediocre and profoundly uninterested in magic. Why doesn't he get better at it? Why doesn't he learn nonverbal magic? When he was going on about how he wanted to meet Snape - lol, last book you couldn't even get out a curse. Come on.18. That at age 17, Harry still cannot recognize people as being complex individuals. He focuses only on his latest perception of them - i.e. for a bit Dumbledore was the worst because he hung out with an evil wizard for two months, nevermind that he's a gazillion years old; and Snape is redeemed for all his sins by his creepy devotion to Harry's mother despite all the fuckery he's been responsible for during Harry's time at Hogwarts and Voldemort attacking him in the first place. Where is your child named after Sirius?19. I cannot believe that there isn't a respectable and notable contingent of Slytherins fighting against Voldemort because despite being traditionalists with their blood purity mumbo jumbo, they don't want to be ruled by an immortal megalomaniac who kills people on whim. How did that not occur to the Malfoys before their involvement, I mean, really. The idea was floated about in GOF briefly but nothing seems to come of it.20. Because Harry was willing to die for EVERYONE, everyone is protected by his love? But he didn't even think that killing himself would save everyone - there was still corporeal Voldemort and Nagini? Ridiculous. It kind of deflates the notion of parental love as well, which I liked.21. Neville should have killed Bellatrix instead of JKR forcing her good femininity vs bad femininity ideas down our throats once again.22. Voldemort's death was absurd. The Elder Wand stuff? What even. And Harry's speechifying ...."},

It was too big: nothing deserves to be that big, not even Jesus, and it was, quite frankly, boring. So I skipped through the book and didn't really pay much attention. I also didn't see the film until much, much later and as a whole, the big pile of fandom just passed me by in to the void of nothingness behind me.As the years passed by, I wanted to dip my toe back in. I was feeling a bit nostalgic, I admit, but I also wanted to see if the magic of Harry Potter that everyone was going on about was there for me, too. TLDR; it is not.This book, the final of the series, is definitely one of the best of the series but it has some serious faults. You can definitely see the pressure that J.K. was under from, oh look, you lot, to finish the book and get it out so they could make the next film. I don't think this was quite the ending she really wanted and that is quite a big disappointment, though we can't hold the author accountable. (It's all your fault, really.)We still have two protagonists who haven't changed much in seven years: Harry and Ron have been the same semi-intelligent, slightly amusing and stupidly brave boys that we met in the first book. Hermione, I am glad to say, has changed from book to book, though there were a few moments when she really went a bit dodgy. As far as the other characters, I have to say they were all pretty much background and dull. I still can't get over how Luna Lovegood just turns up and randomly becomes an important character without actually saying or doing much at all. I also think a lot more could have been done with Neville: I thought he was pretty great and the way he ended the series was wonderful. It's very difficult to enjoy a series of books when you don't like (not hate) the main character. Did anyone really care if Harry died at the end, as long as Voldemort did as well? I didn't.I was also not a fan of the way most of the unpleasant characters were either fat or ugly. Most of the weird characters were a bit odd-looking, as well, and it just felt like an easy get-out of having to think of interesting characters who didn't conform to type. The thing about fantasy is that it's usually mostly the locations and settings that really make it magical. Harry Potter is extremely limited in location and that really made it feel small and closed off. Yes, Hogwarts is a fun Scottish castle, but really how much do we know about Hogwarts; how much did we really see? We barely explore the place and the places around it. I understand that magical people are pretty much hidden away, but it always felt like such a lacking world. Hogwarts was no more magical than Harry's cupboard, really (enchanted ceiling notwithstanding).The Deathly Hallows never quite felt like the ending it should have been. It was definitely the best written of the set, which just shows how a writer learns from their previous mistakes (which, sadly, a lot of authors don't seem to do) and the flow from preceding book to the follow up was better than it had been earlier on.I can't really see myself ever reading these ever again, unless I really run out of things to read. I find that rather saddening, because I can remember a time in my childhood-during the first few years of the earlier books and films-when I really loved this series. I remember the two weeks I really wanted to be an actor so I could be in the film and elope with whoever it was that played Sirius (Gary Oldman, I know, but back then I didn't care). I strongly remember that I felt bad for being in love with Draco for about a year, too (I have a thing for blondes). I will look back fondly on my mis-remembered feelings on Luna and treasure my rekindled love for Hermione. I think I am incredibly lucky to be of an age where I grew up at the right time for this series, but I'm also not supremely disappointed that the magic is no longer there."},

I mean honestly woman, you spend all this time telling us how wonderful James and his friends are, that they were such great, heroic people and you make the Marauders (who in some ways are more loved than the Trio) into a group of utter assholes. I couldn't find the redeeming qualities. And Lily! We spend six bloody book listening to \"You have your mother's eye.\" and promises that Lily will play an important role in the story, then when all is said and done it's because Snape was lusting after her! That's the fucking reason? She dropped the ball here. Tonks was never more than a flat, uninteresting piece of wallpaper. Lupin was unrealistic given the character building you'd done in the other novels. Ginny could have actually had a real role, contributed in some way! Hermione was reduced to a walking 'Hogwarts, A History'. Ron, was, well Ron, useless, immature and pathetic. At least Harry stopped being a whiny, angst-filled 14-year-old GIRL. The list goes on and on.Alright, I am now forced to say something I never thought I would say. The slash (male/male shippers) actually have a point. Remus and Sirius in a relationship makes far more sense than Remus and Tonks. The undercurrents are there and least he was a moderately developed (and promising to be so much more if it hadn't been for the damned drapery) character as opposed to furniture. And what the hell, fucking Dobby was the most poignant death in the entire damn novel. This is so wrong. There is so much depth and emotion there for a secondary character, who for many fans was the HP version of Jar Jar Binks. He gets an entire scene whereas Remus, who is Harry's last tie to his parents, and Tonks get one sentence, a side note in a paragraph.It was predictable and nowhere near as good as it could have been. JKR has talent. There are moments that are just beautiful, and she has created a wonderfully descriptive world. However I don't think she had the chops to sustain it. We could see that in earlier books where instead of showing the action she fell back on \"Harry wakes up in the hospital wing and everything is explained to him.\" Battles and epic quests aren't her strong point. It is sad when your epilogue reads like a bad piece of fanfiction. It's also sad when it seems like fanfic authors could have done a better job writing your story, when they would have stayed more in canon.I will give her this, I loved Neville in this book. He deserved all the screen time he got and more. There has been so much character development for him since the start of the series. However, and this is both a kudos and a critic, the most character development in the story went to the Malfoy family. They went from foil evil characters/villains to real people whose main concern was for their family. The scene where Narcissa and Lucius ignore the battle and are desperately trying to find Draco was spectacular. This could have been a great book, hell it could have at least been good. Instead it is something fans will read because they loved the series. There is so much more to say, but I think I'll cut it short here."},

It can't be.), and considering how easy the first several books in the series were, it just felt like forever. A measly nothing compared to some friends of mine who, from H.P. onset, had to wait a year between each book. Sometimes more-- one friend took 8 years to complete the series due to the epidemic we Bibliophile's refer to as \"release waiting\".I loved this book best of all. It showed Harry's dark and light, with more balance than the previous books. Harry was what you wanted and expected him to be. A friend whose personality you knew well and could predict. That was the other fun part of Deathly Hallows, being able to predict with authority different mysteries along the way, just from your absorption in each character and the different spells and places and names that seemed alive-- you know your magic if you've made it this far. JKR is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Every little detail is important. Everything. In a way that leaves no stone unturned, but not in a irritating fashion. It's concise. It grabs you and it feels real.The last 100 pages were almost agonizing in their emotional force. The book was immediately on a whole different level than all the editions before. I am talking 2nd. page into the book, it was darker and more intense-- a higher level of writing, a deeper level of what you knew was coming from the beginning. A terrible cost. Even JKR's vocabulary choices. It's elevated and therefor all the more impacting. Voldemort comes into his full stride, completing his ultimate symbolism of the dark side of man and the spirit, and it is terrifying. These characters that you feel you know are in life or death situations for over 700 pages. It's utterly gripping.I felt like I had said goodbye to an old friend at the end. That's always a good thing for a reader.Yeah, it's a young adult story. Clearly. But it has a wonderful message and unbelievably inspiring characters and situations that teach lessons that all ages could do well to heed.I treasure my books. If you've been to my house, you know this. If you went in my room as a kid or teenager, you'd know this. My life has been surrounded with books. Rarely loaned and often cleaned, they fill my home. I have Harry Potter sitting beneath my fireplace, in the center of my living room. Just to make sure I can keep an eye on them.\"Would I?\" asked Dumbledore heavily. \"I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find their own surprise that they wear it well.\""},

This is different from all the other books as the war has been lost and Hogwarts is not the main setting of the story. While this is the most adult book in the series, the series does still feel innocent especially as the characters do not think like most teenagers. These books have all been about how love triumphs all and that death is not the end but the beginning of a new story. Unfortunately, it was obvious that the Deathly Hallows were added just to this book as there was no references to them in previous books unlike the Horcruxes. One thing I have never liked in this series is the labelling of Slytherin students as evil, as just because they are cunning and ambitious does not mean they will all turn into Death Eaters. Is it bad that I was more upset over Hedwig dying than MoodyU+2019s death?I always felt that Harry should have died at the end of this series for two reasons, firstly then Rowling would not have been pressured to write more in the series, and secondly it felt like HarryU+2019s entire life was destined to stopping Voldemort and, like Frodo in The Lord of the Rings, I am not sure he would have been able to move and carry on with his life without a purpose. I also really liked NevilleU+2019s development over the series as he has gained confidence and has become the person he was meant to be.I love Ron and HermioneU+2019s relationship and when I first read this book when I was younger, I was hoping that they would end up together but now I feel that with the amount of time they spent together without acting on their feelings they would have been stuck in the friend zone. Snape is one of the most interesting and complex characters and I loved learning more about his past. I also liked hearing about DumbledoreU+2019s darker past which I feels humanises him. I guessed what was going to happen to Lupin and Tonks in this book after Harry was named Godfather, as I could tell that TedU+2019s situation would mirror HarryU+2019s. When I first read this series I thought the ending would have been about Hogwarts and maybe Harry and VoldemortU+2019s links to the houses or that Neville was actually the chosen one. After I finished this book when it originally came out I felt like my childhood had ended as I had grown up with these characters and even now 8 years later I also got the same feeling.

And I did - with four hours to spare. *high fives self*For some reason, this reread brought a hell of a lot of emotions with it. The developing relationship between Ron and Hermione gave me feels. Harry's reaction to Lupin turning up gave me feels. All the deaths gave me feels, obviously. Neville proving himself to be a true Gryffindor and his grandmother's pride in him gave me feels. McGonagall's pride and heartbreak over Harry gave me feels. Dumbledore's backstory gave me feels. And I may have broken down and sobbed during the scene between Ron and Harry that I mentioned below. Basically, this book is perfection, and it's hands down my favourite of the series. Now let's just go ahead and pretend that Snape redemption plot never happened... 29/6/2014Everything I said last time around still stands. But one of the things I find most interesting about Deathly Hallows is getting to see the other side of Dumbledore. In the other six books, he's basically presented as this massive force for good, who would never make dubious decisions or do the wrong thing or endanger his students. But here? Here we see that Dumbledore operated in the grey areas of morality as much as anyone. Which is one of those interesting things that comes with age - realising that your teachers and your heroes aren't infallible. They're human. 18/3/2013There are literally no words for how much I adore this book. It takes a lot in a book to make me cry (almost nothing, however, when it comes to movies and TV shows...), and yet Deathly Hallows reduces me to a weeping mess every time I read it. That said, the epilogue grates a little more every time - it just feels slightly sloppy or a little too neat and tidy or SOMETHING.That said, I love how there are so many tendrils to the story that have been gradually developed over the previous six books, and how expertly they're all pulled together here. Neville becomes more of a BAMF with every reading, and I will never not cheer for Molly Weasley screaming \"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH\" at Bellatrix. While I know a lot of people get all \"Harry Potter and the Prolonged Camping Trip\" about the central portion of the book, those same people likely would have been upset or annoyed if they had, as Harry yells at Ron, been finding a Horcrux a week and home safe and sound by Christmas. Besides, the prolonged camping trip leads to what is arguably my favourite moment in the entire series - Ron destroying the locket, then breaking down in tears, and Harry saying \"She's like my sister. I love her like a sister and I reckon she feels the same way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew.\" It's such a simple moment, such a small thing. But for me, it says so much about Ron, about Harry, and about the honesty that underpins their friendship. In summary, twenty years from now, people will say to me \"After all this time?\". And my reply will be \"Always.\""},

They are among the best written books of whatever level I've come across...They are an absorbing story of believable characters in a well constructed story world. It has it's light and it has it's dark. I come in every case very close to giving them 5 star ratings. I wish we had half stars or possibly a 10 star system as there are 5 star books I like much better, but 4 star books I don't like as well. It's a compromise. So, let's call it 4 stars and highly recommended. Review to be expanded.As you can see I upped the rating to 5 stars. the underlying story comes to a conclusion that also carries a nice allegorical turn. Harry has not only gotten older he has (if slowly) grown. This and these novels do something that the best novels should do.They leave you wanting more about the characters and more about the story, because they have become real to you and you care about them.Highly recommended. Start from the first book, which is much younger in feel and follow the characters as they grow up. Do it many times as it's like revisiting old friends and favorite places. Don't miss it/them.Really. "},

Rowling)It all started on an ordinary train ride from Manchester to London. What follows two decades after is nothing short of magical: million copies of the book in 64 languages have been sold (some in matter of minutes), spawning movie franchise, toys and other merchandise with an upcoming theme park to open some time soon. It has also catapulted its celebrated author from being a struggling single mom to becoming BritainU+2019s richest woman. Then come November this year a renewed U+201CHarrysteriaU+201D will grip the world over as devoted fans flock to the cinemas for the first of the highly-anticipated two-part final movie installment. This, my friends, is the cultural phenomena wrought by the Harry Potter book series which in its wake energized a generation of readers young and old alike.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the final volume in the series (touted as the most anticipated novel in history) is from beginning to end a thrillsome chase between Harry and his arch nemesis, Lord Voldemort. Fully restored to his former self, the Dark Lord with the Death Eaters discusses a new plot to kill the boy wizard at Malfoy Manor. In a deadly broomstick pursuit just a few pages later, where Harry is about to be spirited off into hiding by remaining members of the Order of the Phoenix, may make readers cry out that the cost this early are dear. The Dark Lord no longer lurks in the shadows; his diabolical influence along with the palpable fear on his persona resurges and with his forces mounts a successful takeover and infiltration of the Ministry of Magic itself and Hogwarts. A Nazi-like racial campaign to U+201CregisterU+201D and control Muggle-born and U+201Cblood traitorU+201D wizards burgeons. Harry meanwhile finds himself both a fugitive and a combatant, trying to elude the clutches of Lord Voldemort even as he tries to locate and destroy the Horcruxes. As with other earlier novels, there is a magical puzzle at the heart of Hallows that of the artifacts called the Deathly Hallows the possessor of which enables one to conquer Death.When I picked up the book and felt its sheer heft, fascinated by the exquisite jacket illustration by Mary Grandpre, I felt an odd combination of excitement and regret. IU+2019d been waiting for this moment for so long U+2014 years in fact since reading book one and two in high school; three, four and five in college; then the sixth this year U+2014 and yet I almost didnU+2019t want the experience to be over, didnU+2019t want to know that goods times has reached its end. However, once I opened the book, the feeling was comparable to a well intended Portkey, sucking me once more in a world IU+2019ve grown to love and familiar with, yet with a pang of sadness and awareness that itU+2019s the last leg of the journey this time around.Hallows clearly has the feel of a series finale, as virtually everybody who had figured somewhat prominently in the previous books shows up and most of the settings are revisited. Coming into the seventh book, Rowling had quite a task as she must now answer all the questions and subplot threads she had buried in the preceding six books. In hindsight, I just canU+2019t help but be amazed at the sheer, immensely complicated arc the story has turned and I now realize how clues were strewn throughout the books (with some I readily picked up and some so sneaky with utter obviousness Rowling never truly ceases to astound me).Perhaps the most engaging part of Hallows is RowlingU+2019s character work particularly with Harry in a continuing progression as he completes the painful journey to adulthood struggling with necessary sacrifices even as he reflects on all that heU+2019s been through. He must also deal with the aggressive influence of his link to Lord Voldemort, which tortures him and also enables him to keep track of what the Dark Lord is up to. Rowling also takes the time to bring HarryU+2019s friendship with Ron and Hermione into full focus. She even manages to give remarkable moments to characters such as Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood, among others. Rowling do prove that she can still intrigue as we are made to see that kindly Dumblerdore, sinister Severus Snape and even Dudley Dursley might be more complicated than what we earlier imagined them to be and that they might have hidden aspects to their personalities.Hallows is, indeed, darker, still creepy in some parts and packed with an emotional wallop as entire platoon of characters, both beloved and wicked, are mowed down, the casualties coming so suddenly and furiously, it will disconcert the hardiest of readers; in all sense itU+2019s a very much grown up read. With this final volume, Rowling does some of her best writing yet keeping the prose consistently reader-friendly (well almost, until you see MollyU+2019s cursing) and accessible, with none of the divergence that bogged down the sixth book. I tried to disengage a few times, forcing myself to read more slowly, wanting to savor the plot, but before long I was turning the pages in a blur.At journeyU+2019s end, J.K. Rowling leaves readers with a gift of a whimsical world of magic and imagination that rivals Middle-Earth, Oz and Narnia. Hallows bears the strength and weaknesses of the entire series in concentrated form, like a potion produced pure. It is a satisfying, lovingly crafted final gift from Rowling to her readers and a fitting sendoff to Harry Potter, the boy wizard whose adventures enchanted an entire generation of dreamers thought untouched by a charm of reading, perhaps the most impressive magic trick of all._______________Published by Arthur A.

Zoe describes it as \"hitting a bullseye six thousand miles away.\"More than not, this is how I always think about endings. When you begin, you fire the shot, and when it ends you hope that it lands exactly where you want it to. The more complex the story, the more complex it becomes to hitting a bullseye. And ending a single novel is hard. Giving it a suitable ending and a fantastic climax is really, really difficult. Now add two novels to that. Now you need four endings, a suitable ending for each novel and an ending for all three collectively. And doing that is really hard. Suzanne Collins couldn't do it. Veronica Roth sure as shit couldn't do it.And it's hard for a TV show. I'm a massive LOST fan, and I think hitting that ending as hard as they did, from as far away as they did, is next level writing. They had entire elements of the show they couldn't use (Mr. Eko is the best example), things that couldn't happen, plans that 100% changed and meant guessing at a different version of their already guessed ending.And it's hard for this, the final(ish) installment of the Harry Potter series. Seven books. Minimum eight endings (I'd argue it's nine ...). Tons of characters to say goodbye to... a gigantic mythology to wrap up.... And Rowling, being the insanely ambitious, amazing writer that she is, basically goes completely off the reservation here. Hogwarts doesn't show up until the third act. The entire middle of the book is essentially a camping trip around England. The first act (even from page one) shifts the entire book into a status quo none of us really, actually, truly anticipated. AND THEN halfway through the she goes and introduces a completely new branch of the mythology around which the whole climax of the novel pivots.It is, to say, the sort of thing that probably shouldn't work. I love how much the last installment is the \"light-it-on-fire, go-for-broke\" installment, but this is literally the stuff of absolute legend. And Rowling pulls it off. She pulls it off she pulls it off she pulls it off with finesse and grace, giving the ultimate capstone to what is probably the single most influential storytelling event in western pop culture since Star Wars.It is, to put it simply, basically perfect.It's hard to describe how much I love this book. I adore this book. If I had to pick a Harry Potter book that best shows off why I love the series, this would be it. It's a fucking masterpiece. Watching all of the elements come back once again (noticing every single nostalgia reference is easier once you've had time to absorb it for a while), seeing her weave and out in a victory lap tour of the series, seeing how well she treats every single character who she could possibly squeeze into this book, the continued awfulness of Umbridge, the redemption of Percy, the delicateness with which she treats Severus Snape, the coming-around of Dudley, the hubris of Voldemort.... It is.... so perfect.Truly, this is the book that has everything, only let down by the fact that Harry and his friends don't go to Hogwarts for another year. But after Half-Blood Prince what is there left to do at Hogwarts? How would they be expected to defeat a fully empowered adult wizard without acting like fully empowered and independent adults? It has two massive heist sequences, a thrilling as all hell chase scene, a chapter that's basically as taut a thriller as I've ever seen her write (Malfoy Manor), one of the best extended flashback sequences I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing, a brand new mythology that it's easy to forget SHE MADE UP FROM SCRATCH (Three Brothers), a massive war story on the Hogwarts grounds.... It has the origin story of Albus Dumbledore (providing the layers to his character that make him my favorite character in the series)... It has the best thing J.K. Rowling has ever written (The Forest Again).It is a novel about generational divides, a beacon of progress and humanity, a statement that the old must pass that the new might inherit the earth, because whatever current generation is on top can't save the world. All things change and evolve. The world can only be saved and shaped by those who will inherit it. The last image is of even the next generation who will take over once Harry and his friends are done and dusted.Deathly Hallows is about the best thing you could hope for at the end of a series. It has heartbreak, it has laughs, it has moments of sheer badassery, it has entire chapters that makes us all weep. It is devastating, it is empowering, it sees Harry torn to his utter lowest point and then built up into the hero we all knew he would eventually become. It is massive and epic and yet impossibly small and understated, with gigantic moments flying by as personal and quick in the blink of an eye and feeling impossibly mythic just a few pages later. It ends with a magic trick and its ultimate victory is unabashedly a celebration (and bittersweet) but undeniable in its euphoria.It is perfect children's literature. It is everything I could possibly want from an ending or final installment. And it only gets better every single time, which, in a final installment, shouldn't happen.

ESE FINAL. Siempre fui fan de Harry Potter, no recuerdo cuando vi la primer pelU+00EDcula, ni la edad, y no me voy a poner a calcular. Pero siempre estuve enamorada de Harry y adoraba los magos. En el 2011 me decidU+00ED leerlos y, U+00A1no me arrepiento!Entonces, quiero partir el libro en varias partes y comentar algo chiquito sobre ello. Porque, siendo totalmente sincera, siento que nunca podrU+00EDa expresar bien lo que me pasU+00F3 en cada escena.En la primera parte se resume a: U+201CTe invito a romper tu corazU+00F3n con la muerte de Hedwig y Moody and I don't careU+201D. Les puedo jurar que yo todavU+00EDa tengo en mente que ellos siguen vivos.

U+00BFQuU+00E9 harU+00EDas sin Ron que, ademU+00E1s de ser tu mejor amigo y tu cable a tierra, es la persona que te levanta el U+00E1nimo y siempre estarU+00E1 para ti? Toda esta parte me daba bronca, lo entendU+00EDa, U+00A1pero si yo fuese U+00E9l no serU+00EDa tan cabeza hueca para no llevarlos!DespuU+00E9s de eso: U+00BFUna boda? U+00BFEn serio? Y acU+00E1 vienen lindas partes como: los celos de Ron hacia Viktor Krum, los celos de Harry hacia Viktor Krum... (Viktor, te hubieses quedado en casa).

Leer de vuelta la muerte de Lily y James es desgarrador.Al final... el epU+00EDlogo: A ver, espero no ser la U+00FAnica persona que piensa asU+00ED, pero vi muchos potterheads o fans o personas que leyeron el libro que dijeron que el epU+00EDlogo era innecesario y que estaba mal, que no debU+00EDa ser asU+00ED y demU+00E1s cosas.

Y bueno, tampoco podU+00EDan esperar que Harry, Ron, Ginny, Hermione, Draco se subieran al tren con sus hijos y Rowling escriba un octavo, noveno, dU+00E9cimo libro. Totalmente no. El libro tiene este final y listo.Creo que hasta acU+00E1 termino, concluyo con que Harry Potter es una de las mejores cosas que me pasU+00F3 y vuelvo a repetir, agradezco eso.

Le morti sono dolorose da affrontare, ma coerenti con la situazione descritta, ed anche gli altri grandi avvenimenti della trama non possono che lasciare il lettore con il fiato sospeso, permettendo di ridere, piangere, di sentirsi intimamente connessi con i personaggi che si U+00E8 imparato ad amare ed i cui archi narrativi si sono infine avviati alla conclusione. Il settimo libro di questa serie U+00E8 un inno all'amicizia, ai valori piU+00F9 alti che dovrebbero regolare i rapporti umani, alla solidarietU+00E0, al coraggio, all'unitU+00E0, tutti messaggi che vengono descritti magistralmente nella loro contrapposizione alle forze del male. Il talento dell'autrice riesce a rendere questi valori palpabili, edificanti, con uno stile semplice, scorrevole - anche se certamente piU+00F9 maturo rispetto ai capitoli precedenti - e coinvolgente, cosU+00EC da rendere la lettura piacevole a tutti.Dall'inizio alla fine, questo volume non cessa di stupire e ad ogni rilettura possono essere rilevati nuovi dettagli che lo rendono ancora piU+00F9 godibile e piacevole. E' appassionante seguire il nostro trio nella ricerca degli Horcrux, U+00E8 doloroso vederli soffrire, ci si sente tesi mentre ci si immedesima nelle situazioni di ansia e durante la battaglia di Howgarts non si puU+00F2 fare a meno di commuoversi. L'epilogo, d'altro canto, riesce a tirare le fila della vicenda, regalando un momento di grande gioia e semplicitU+00E0, quell'aria di normalitU+00E0 e tranquillitU+00E0 che tutti speravano potesse finalmente caratterizzare le vicende dei personaggi che tanto abbiamo amato. La fine di un grande viaggio, questo, che non ha nulla di cui essere rimproverato: c'U+00E8 azione, tantissima, amicizia, amore, paura, dubbi, vita e morte, divertimento e tensione, il tutto sapientemente dosato e messo in scena da un cast di personaggi indimenticabili, tanto quanto i luoghi in cui essi si muovono. Un piccolo, grande capolavoro della letteratura per ragazzi, che si conclude in maniera impeccabile, lasciando nel cuore dei lettori un vuoto e, allo stesso tempo, una sensazione di calore, malinconica gioia, felicitU+00E0 per aver portato a compimento questa avventura."},

But my goodness, I love this book so much. Not only does everything come together, but we learn so much more about Dumbledore's history, and what he means when he says that it's choice over ability, what he means when he says that love is the most powerful, what he means when he says to trust in others. As a counterpoint, Voldemort only equates trusting with necessity and regret. This book isn't perfect - it's just NEARLY perfect. I noticed this time around that there were an awful lot of colons strewn about. Places where I think a semicolon or comma or period would be better. But that was only a little distracting. I would also have liked a bit more of the epilogue, to know about everyone that I've loved all this time and how they are doing. And, I might have missed it, but I don't know how Harry and the others could have gotten to Shell Cottage, since Bill, Secret Keeper, hadn't told them about it. Technically, Ron shouldn't have been able to name it. But. But, in light of the otherwise amazingness of this book, I can overlook one tiny little misstep plot hole. I mean, maybe Dobby had to really apparate them there, because Elf magic is different. But I still don't know how they'd have been able to speak the name of the place without Bill having first told them. Anyway. I love the way that the Horcruxes and Hallows are blended here. Both are vital and important to Harry's success, and both must be sought for the right reasons. Not for personal gain or invincibility, but to help other people, to protect them. I've read this series... many times. But it amazes me how I'm still affected by it, every time. I still get nervous for Harry, I still ache for his losses and fears. My heart still pounds every time Hermione is dragged off to be tortured and Ron screams for Bellatrix to take him instead immediately - no hesitation. It makes me love him even more because he doesn't even think about it - it's just a natural urge to protect her. This book makes my soul ache. Love love love love it. I can't help it, I just wallow in it, and as much as I sob my way through it... it's in a proud way. I'm so proud of Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Of Neville. Of all of them. Fantastic. "},

In my own weird journey, I read all of JK Rowling's other books before reading Harry. I am not usually one to follow fads in reading is one reason it took me so long. I almost always regret wasting time on modern books 'everybody' is reading. I was impressed with Rowling's writing and what I considered her honesty. I liked her so when they rereleased the Jim Dale recordings I thought, \"Why not?\" I am so glad I did. I might even read them all again someday; it is hard to say goodbye."},

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows has several powerful themes, but my favorite message that the story expresses is to never give up. Harry Potter has lost many things he cares about in this point of the story. He can't go back to the one place he feels at home (Hogwarts), he can't openly protect his friends from danger, and many of his loved ones have been brutally murdered. Even though his situation seems hopeless, Harry never gives up trying to defeat Voldemort. He moves forward in his journey to destroy the horcruxes without a second thought. He doesn't even seem to consider giving up as an option. This is something to be admired in a hero!"},

It has a really good ending, but how it gets there is pretty dull, unnecessarily convoluted, and relies heavily on characters suddenly not being the same characters they've been for the last six books.I like to look at the first third of this book as being about the same as the first 40 mins or so of Return of the Jedi. The two have generally the same problems and they came about in generally the same way. We have a really epic and thought provoking cliffhanger in the previous volume, but then we have to spend the time at the beginning of this one resolving it before we can move on to the actual story of this one. While not horrible, or even really all that bad, it's unnecessary. It just keeps going on, and on, and on, and on, and on, and it's just like, hey, can we maybe get on with THIS story sometime in the book instead of resolving the last one? And throughout the entire thing I keep thinking to myself, why is this even happening? The cliffhanger didn't really need to be there from the previous book. And we already found out who R.A.B. was in Order of the Phoenix, so anyone who was paying attention wasn't spending the time between books wondering and theorizing. So, really, what, exactly, was the point of the fake locket? It just takes up space, giving the characters busy work to plow through to clean up after the previous book before they can get on with this book's story. In my opinion, Rowling did herself a pretty big disservice with the whole fake locket business, because instead of heading straight into the story of the Deathly Hallows, which aren't even mentioned until over halfway through the book, we have to spend a few hundred pages resolving the fake locket that we really didn't need to. It makes the book longer for no real payoff, much like the beginning of Return of the Jedi, which makes the movie longer, with no real payoff, and, in fact, it made the movie too long, and a very tense and exciting subplot had to be removed from the movie to make room for it. The Emperor orders the Death Star to fire on the moon just after the shield goes down and all of the rebel fighters are flying into it, and there was supposed to be this really tense race to see whether the fighters would reach the reactor before it powers up to fire, with Luke trying to beat Vader and get to the Emperor and make him take back the order. Most of the scenes were already filmed with completed special effects. You can find them on the bonus disc of the bluray boxed set. And all that awesomeness was cut from the final film because George Lucas just had to leave us hanging for 3 years on what happened to Han after Boba Fett got away with him at the end of the previous movie, and spent a third of the run time of this one resolving that plotline. Another thing I don't really like about this book is how Harry is suddenly a genius that knows all the answers and figures everything out on his own. He has NEVER figured out anything on his own in the entire series. He had always needed the help of others to get through things and piece together the mysteries. And here, he just sort of becomes a genius that doesn't need to rely on the others to solve everything in the end. It was pretty out of character for him. I also got really sick of Hermione's nagging. She's never really nagged all that much in previous books, but in this one she is constantly nagging at both Harry and Ron, which seems like a really feeble attempt by the author to introduce some more tension between the characters.Anyway, I do like this book, or at least the parts of it that are actually relevant to the story of this book, rather than dealing with the previous book's baggage. I really enjoy the ending, and how it all comes together with the big battle at Hogwarts. I really like how Neville had a chance to shine in this book, showing how much he has grown as a character. There are some things here that I feel the movie had a better grasp on than the book, however. Some authors are great at writing action, some authors are better at other things, and Rowling is one of the latter. She's great with mysteries and comedy, and day to day frustrations and slow building tension. She's not all that great with action. So, anyway, my final verdict on this one is that it's a good ending, but not without it's problems. There's a lot of unnecessary fluff, and a huge portion of the book is devoted to tying up loose plot threads from the previous book that really could have been cut out and both books would have been better for it. There are some pretty long boring stretches in this book, where it really seems like a good editor and a couple more drafts to tighten things up could have helped, but on the whole I still really liked this book. So if you happen to have built yourself a steampunk time machine and are visiting 2016 from the early 19th century and have never heard of Harry Potter before, give it a try, it's a really fun and entertaining series.And now I'm all caught up and ready for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them next month. Woohoo... except that it means I now have nothing to distract me from finishing Empire of Storms by Sarah J. Maas, which is soooooooooo not very good."},

The conclusion to an epic tale which holds a special place in my soul.* * *The wizarding world and the muggle world is slowly turning into a chaotic mess. Harry Potter is the key to defeat Lord Voldemort. Reading this book never bored me, not even for a second. The story turned more intense and sinister. A lot of people said that this book served as a summary of some sort, because the characters repeated what they did in the past years. Such as; Going to Gringotts Wizarding Bank, riding a broomstick, drinking Polyjuice Potion, and returning to the Chamber of Secrets.I've also read two articles which is connected to this;   The Battle of Hogwarts is the previous six books in reverse order, and   J.K. Rowling used this clever strategy in the final 'Harry Potter' book.* * *One of the delightful things that made me genuinely happy, amidst all the depression and tragedy, is Ron and Hermione. I've been rooting for them since the beginning and this is the book where they seem to be more open about their true feelings toward each other. * * *I'm not a huge fan of Ginny x Harry pairing to be honest, but I wish they showed in the film how their relationship grew. In the movie their love seemed to pop out of nowhere. I also wish they showed how badass Ginny really is.* * *I kind of ship Helena Ravenclaw (a.k.a. the Grey Lady) and the Bloody Baron. Their story reminds me of Penny Dreadful.* * *I love how Xenophilius Lovegood reminds me of Howl, (from   Howl's Moving Castle), and I could not help but associate their house to the Moving Castle itself. I mean, blonde hair, eccentric lifestyle, house cluttered with thousands of objects U+2014 Need I say more? Look at them. What's not to love?* * *  U+201CSaintlike,U+201D repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. U+201CYou see . . . IU+2019m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?U+201Dwaahh I'm in love.I love the twins so much. I love them to bits. Fred and George are inseparable. So, why, just... why did Miss Rowling kill Fred?* * *  \"After all, to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\"U+2014 Albus DumbledoreU+2022 HedwigU+2022 DobbyU+2022 Remus Lupin & Nymphadora Tonks... I was taken aback by their deaths. Big time. And then some.* * *The Tales of Beedle the Bard gave me the chills. There is a theory I've read about The Tale of the Three Brothers. It goes like this:Voldemort = Antioch Peverell, \"The one who died drunk in power.\"Snape = Cadmus Peverell, \"The one who died for love.\"Harry = Ignotus Peverell, \"The one who greeted Death like an old friend.\" Dumbledore = Death, Old friend.If you think about it, yes, it does make sense. * * *So who cast the spell that killed Ariana Dumbledore? I think it was Gellert Grindelwald because he knew how to cast Avada Kedavra, doesn't he? But what if she killed herself accidentally? There's just so many possibilities.* * *Speaking of sisters, I kind of feel sorry for Petunia, because she can't go to Hogwarts. I never liked her character because of how awful she is, but still, her effort to write a letter to Dumbledore was futile. It's kind of pathetic, really. Because of that she was always jealous of Lily, bitter even.* * *It's kind of ironic how Snuffles (Sirius' alias) and Snivellus (Root word - Snivel. Nickname given to Snape by James and Sirius,) almost share the same meaning.* * *  \"After all this time?\"\"Always.\" said snape.Reading the previous books of Harry Potter, I was led to believe that Severus Snape is a neutral character. A literary red herring. He's not good, he's not evil. He's somewhere in between. He's a mystery. But then as the books continued, I believe that he cared for Harry unconditionally. There's more to him than meets the eye. He is altruistic to the core. He tried so hard to hide the fact that he is also a human being capable of loving U+2014 He suppressed himself of this tiny mundane pleasure, mainly because of self-loathing. He always maintained this dark image he wanted everyone else to believe, but he was not as cruel as he appeared to be.He never bothered to credit himself about the good things he had done. Yes, he made some mistakes, but he owned them. He more than owned them. Seriously, if you are not moved by his unrequited love for Lily, then you have no heart.* * *As the characters from the books grow up before my eyes, I realized I have grown up too U+2014 physically, mentally, and emotionally. Words will not be enough to express how much I loved reading Harry Potter. How it helped me cope through some dark moments in my life. Thank you J.K. Rowling. This experience has been beyond magical.

Recuerdo que sabU+00EDa la fecha exacta en que llegaba a mi paU+00EDs, recuerdo que fui a mi librerU+00EDa de siempre a pedir que me lo reservaran porque temU+00EDa que se agotaran en el primer dU+00EDa. Recuerdo que el precio me habU+00EDa parecido caro (una ganga comparado con hoy en dU+00EDa), pero yo lo iba a pagar igual porque era el U+00FAltimo. U+00A1El U+00FAltimo de la saga de Harry Potter!Y me acuerdo que al terminarlo, me sentU+00ED vacU+00EDa. No era mi favorito. Me gustaban mucho mU+00E1s los otros libros anteriores. Pero este era el U+00FAltimo. No habU+00EDa mU+00E1s Harry Potter despuU+00E9s. No habU+00EDa nada. ReciU+00E9n este aU+00F1o, cinco aU+00F1os despuU+00E9s, saliU+00F3 alguna noticia de nuevos cuentos sobre Harry Potter. Pero en ese momento era morir con lo que tenU+00EDas en tus manos, el U+00FAltimo libro: tU+00F3malo o dU+00E9jalo, compadre. Pospuse su relectura mucho, justamente por la razU+00F3n de que no era mi favorito. El quinto de la saga lo leU+00ED unas cuatro veces, y los demU+00E1s, al menos dos veces cada uno. Pero este no lo habU+00EDa vuelto a tocar. QuizU+00E1 porque no sucede en Hogwarts, quizU+00E1 porque ya sabU+00EDa quiU+00E9nes se morU+00EDan, quizU+00E1 porque simplemente era el U+00FAltimo. No lo sabU+00EDa.Pero ahora que lo releU+00ED, me di cuenta de muchas cosas que mi yo de doce aU+00F1os no sabU+00EDa asociar. Me di cuenta de cosas que solo mi yo de dieciocho de ahora podrU+00EDa comprender, porque ahora tengo cinco aU+00F1os mU+00E1s de vida y cinco aU+00F1os mU+00E1s de lectura y de cultura encima. Lo primero que me percatU+00E9 de esta U+00FAltima novela era la similitud con la historia real que todos compartimos. Sencillo: un lU+00EDder que se cree con la autoridad de elegir quiU+00E9n merece vivir bien y quiU+00E9n no; restricciones; toques de queda; autoritarismo. U+00BFLes suena a algo? SU+00ED, es Voldemort, que condena a los muggles por ser de sangre impura y tiene a su sU+00E9quito de seguidores, que son los MortU+00EDfagos. Pero si escudriU+00F1an un poquito mejor, descubrirU+00E1n que el siglo pasado un hombre alemU+00E1n intentU+00F3 lo mismo con los judU+00EDos y los gays y tambiU+00E9n tenU+00EDa sus seguidores...Lo que mU+00E1s me sorprendiU+00F3 de la relectura fue darme cuenta de eso. Que Rowling recreU+00F3 en un libro para niU+00F1os todas las desgracias que el mundo habU+00EDa sufrido a mediados del siglo pasado. Y que seguro un niU+00F1o no lo nota de esa forma, sino que le parece que es algo que solo puede pasar en el mundo de Harry Potter. Esto, concluyo, hace a Voldemort mucho mU+00E1s real y letal de lo que nos pareciU+00F3 en todos los libros. Esto vuelve al SeU+00F1or Tenebroso no un personaje, sino una persona. Lo que tambiU+00E9n descubrU+00ED en la relectura son un par de errores tradicionales que se le escapan a cualquiera, solo que, como coloco a Rowling siempre en un pedestal, pensU+00E9 que ella no caerU+00EDa en ellos. Hay demasiados plot holes  en la novela, que pretenden ser arreglados con un simple diU+00E1logo o dos palabras, justificando ese errorcito. Me molesta, es como un zumbido de mosquito en medio de la noche, pero bueno, supongo que la autora no podU+00EDa remitirse a corregir libros anteriores para hacer que todo saliera derechito y perfecto en este. TambiU+00E9n en su momento no supe ver bien las muertes de los personajes. No entendU+00EDa quU+00E9 tan grave era para la saga en general que muriera tal o cual personaje. Ahora que lo releU+00ED, se me llenaron los ojos de lU+00E1grimas por Remus, Tonks, y mU+00E1s que nadie, Fred, de cuyo gemelo ya todos conocemos el destino (el pobre George no pudo volver a elaborar un Patronus en su vida, y si se mira en el espejo de Erised, solo ve su reflejo - lU+00E1grimas, contU+00E9nganse). Sigo pensando, y esto ya lo hacU+00EDa con doce aU+00F1os, que la pareja de Ron y Hermione me parece sumamente forzada. Para colmo hace poco Rowling confirmU+00F3 que lo mejor habrU+00EDa sido poner a Harry y a Hermione juntos. No porque sonara predecible, o clichU+00E9 (U+00BFel hU+00E9roe principal con la mejor amiga?, quU+00E9 original), sino porque desde siempre notU+00E9 quU+00EDmica suficiente entre los dos. Cuando Hermione queda petrificada en el segundo libro, Harry no sabe quU+00E9 hacer sin ella... Cuando Ron queda en la enfermerU+00EDa, es Hermione con quien Harry se abre al hablar de su padre en el tercer libro... Cuando Harry estU+00E1 por enfrentarse al Colacuerno HU+00FAngaro, es Hermione quien va a desearle buena suerte y a abrazarlo en el cuarto... Estos dos siempre merecieron terminar juntos, aunque Harry se jacte de quererla como una hermana y de estar enamorado de Ginny (que, por cierto, tambiU+00E9n me pareciU+00F3 forzado. Nada en contra de Ginny, me cae sU+00FAper bien, pero cuando uno shipea a una pareja con tanta fuerza no hay quiU+00E9n te convenza de lo contrario). Con este libro llorU+00E9, reU+00ED, y hasta soU+00F1 U+00E9. Fue mi escape a los estudios. La noche previa a rendir mi U+00FAltimo examen en la facultad, este libro fue lo U+00FAnico que me distrajo. En medio de mi estrU+00E9s y desazU+00F3n, me encontrU+00E9 con viejos amigos, con caras conocidas y con algU+00FAn que otro chiste que hizo que me olvidara de mis pesares.Las historias que mU+00E1s amamos viven en nosotros para siempre. AsU+00ED que, cuando vuelvas o por las pU+00E1ginas o por la gran pantalla, Hogwarts estarU+00E1 siempre allU+00ED para darte la bienvenida a casa. ~ J. K. Rowling. "},

What will happen to Hogwarts? Is Snape good or bad? Will Voldemort finally die? And is it possible Harry might die? Many people around the world have been waiting two years for the final installment of the Harry Potter series. As I write this, people of all ages are furiously reading; many have already finished. This is it folks, the last one, with no more planned; and the results are in: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, weighing in at 759 pages, concludes the series in spectacular, jaw-dropping, and awe-inspiring fashion, solidly placing the fantasy series up there with Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, and Stephen KingU+2019s The Dark Tower, possibly as one of the best fantasy series of all time. This seven-book series, which will be published as a complete set on September 18 in a beautifully designed trunk-like box with handles and your very own lock, will be one for the ages, to be read by children for many generations to come.The Death Eaters are slowly but surely taking over, as weU+2019ve always known they eventually would, increasing their numbers and employing the army of Dementors, under the control and guidance of Lord Voldemort. Rowling puts her three main characters U+2013 Harry, Hermione, and Ron U+2013 to the ultimate test here. In the last six books Harry has gotten by with help from friends and teachers, always seemingly getting that necessary and crucial help at the last second; but now the trio are seventeen, no longer considered underage, and able to perform magic wherever and however they so please. Rowling doesnU+2019t hold back, leaving them to fend for themselves, solve their own problems, and get out of each and every situation on their own. Deathly Hallows is nonstop action, one scene of fighting and almost death leading onto the next, as the three seek out the Horcruxes. Going on the vague and barely informative words of wisdom from the late Albus Dumbledore, they piece it together, using their magical and educational knowledge U+2013 not just HermioneU+2019s! U+2013 with the goal of finally defeating Voldemort once and for all. And while Harry has expressed in the past that itU+2019s up to him, heU+2019s the Chosen One, and needs to go it alone, he isnU+2019t given the opportunity here.People are dying, mainly muggles, but also Mudbloods, and any whose bloodline is tainted with that of the non-magical, leading to a growing world that harkens back to the time of the Third Reich in Nazi Germany, as well as echoing the doom and hopelessness of 1984. With VoldemortU+2019s rule seemingly solid and complete, Harry gets help he doesnU+2019t want from the Order of the Phoenix and DumbledoreU+2019s Army, leading up to a great final battle where the castle known as Hogwarts lives up to its name as a defensible fortress.This is the last book folks: who will live and who will die, who will triumph and who will fall is at the mercy of the turning page and the next sentence. But with the size of this book, you can be sure youU+2019ll be on the ride of your life from the first page until the last. And you will feel a sadness and longing at the realization that the long journey in the life of Harry Potter is finally over. Yet Rowling has done such an incredible job with Deathly Hallows, weaving in details and points from all previous six books, that you are left with a strong sense of nostalgia. And whatU+2019s the only cure for this feeling? Why to begin the books all over again with the first when Harry Potter first looked upon Number Four, Privet Drive.For more book reviews, and author interviews, go to BookBanter."},

It's the book with which I have the strongest emotional attachment. Of all the books I've read, this is the one I would choose to read before I died if I had the choice. Not only is it long enough to give me plenty of time to get my affairs in order, but it tells me how to live and how to die. With courage and bravery and by making the choice that is hard and not taking the easy way out. Every one of my favorite characters in this series goes on an emotional journey when faced with the threat of evil, heartbreak, and loss. This book shows me that love is the greatest weapon we have against the throes of evil and misfortune and our own failings as humans. Dobby returning to his former masters' house to save his friend Harry Potter. Hermoine Granger and her compulsion to go to the library. To be the brains behind it all. Luna Lovegood and her indefatigable sense of the unusual slyly masking her emotional connection to Harry and her friends. \"Hermoine my head, Luna my heart,\" I often say. Neville Longbottom becoming Harry's equal in bravery and courage. Harry himself accepting his destiny walking alongside his beloved family into the forest, the family he had longed to see since standing before the Mirror of Erised. What do I see when I look into that same mirror? How am I like Harry? How can I be more like Ron--the heart of the trio? How am even sometimes like Voldemort with his myopic selfishness? Who and what on this earth do I overlook? This book always seems to coincide with emotional upheavals in my life, and this time is no different. It is almost like scripture in that this book speaks to me differently every time I come to it. Some new piece of wisdom comes forward. I leave this reading of Harry Potter with a sense that bravery and courage and walking towards the hard things in your life can only be done with friends and family by your side. But in the end, we all walk into the forest of uncertainty alone, just like Harry. This book holds my dreams and even my tears across the many years I have read and reread it. I know I will return to this world again and again with friends and family old and new. Seeing loved ones fall in love with this world is one of the greatest joys of my life. Welcome to the club. "},

I don't have to send them to school, and I don't really have to read to them. Though, I had a dog who growled during Paradise Lost and a cat who loves Anthony Trollope. Anyway, the point is I am not the targeted age group. I have a soft spot for Potter. Rowling gets children to read long books. It's fantasy. Its about outcasts. It has dogs, cats, owls.I, however, did not really like this one. Why? It didn't need to be as long as it was. It really didn't. It was predictable, at least if you think about everything it was. The real reason, however, is what in Hades did Rowling do to Hermione? I mean, geez, talk about a whining, nagging, annoying girl. She's nothing like she was in the last book. True, she's still smart and far more loyal than Ron. She knows how to pack. But sometimes in the book I just wanted to tell her to be quiet or to stop crying.And what was with all those deaths at the end? Did Rowling just throw names out willy nilly? Remus and Tonks? Because Tonks cares more for her husband than her child? I get people die in war, but the deaths lacked the meaning and feeling that Dobby had. That was a death. The rest just felt like she was running though a list. Real life, maybe. But in this type of book? Why couldn't Harry mourn Hedwig just a little more? Then, I'm suppose to believe that Molly could take out Bellatrix? Really, without Molly showing any real power before? I understand the idea of a mother's rage, but it came across as \"can't le Ginny do it because she's a kid\".And the ending, the fanfic ending? Why would Harry name his child after Snape before naming a child after Sirius? Well, I'm not a kid, so maybe that's why I didn't like this one so much. "},

Harry, Hermione and Ron spend more than half the book just wandering around looking for horcruxes, and they do it in a manner that's alarmingly clumsy given that the fate of wizardom is on their shoulders.2. At various points Rowling conveniently allows Harry (and the reader) to \"see\" (via dreams and visions) what Voldemort is up to, but Voldemort, despite his immense powers, is unable to do the same with Harry. In fact he seems mostly unaware that Harry is spying on him. 3. Help, advice, and historical information (including the secrets of Snape's past) are conveniently passed along to Harry through the pensieve. It's like a magical YouTube.4. Harry gets so much help from a talking image of Dumbledore that the headmaster might as well be there in person.5. Voldemort seems oddly incompetent for an evil overlord about to take over the world.6. The \"last battle\" is unimpressive and even silly at times. (Mrs. Weasley saying \"Get back! She's mine!\" and \"Not my daughter, you bitch!\"? Come on. She's Mrs. Weasley, not Dirty Harry.)7. The resolution between Harry and Voldemort is completely predictable to anyone who's paid attention to the other 6 books. 8. The explanation about the Elder Wand (on which the whole resolution depends) makes no sense, no matter how you look at it. It's just a big, twisted chain of pretzel logic.No, I am not a Harry Potter hater. I loved the series and always looked forward to the next installment. But some of the books were stronger than others and this one, unfortunately, is the weakest."},

When I finished the movies I felt at a kind of loss because it was over but I knew I still had the books to finish so there was still that last bit of attachment. Now..........the books are done.............and I don't know what to do. Lol! You get so attached to the books it's like raising a child and then having them go off on their own. :( I now have a new found respect for J.K. Rowling. The love for the characters, the wizarding world, the detail in each story...........not enough words to say how great these books were. I'm really not the type to reread books, but since I listened to these I think I will reread the actual books at some point. Because I don't think you can have too much time pass without SOME bit of Harry Potter in your life. :)"},

SEvil gets away unpunishedAnd thus Rowling tries to wrap up this clusterfuck of a story by making everything even more absurd. Starting with HarryU+2019s foster parents who are sent to safety. After all these books they remained the same one dimensional evil idiots and they are now simply removed from the story without changing their minds or being punished for everything they did. All Rowling did was having someone scolding them for being bad caretakers, while they are not saying a word in defense. Such wonderful characterization Rowling; I totally believe these are real people. Their son said thanks to Harry but only because he had saved his life. Anyone would have done that; thanking someone doesnU+2019t count as character development, and the reason he was attacked by a fiend was not the result of him being a stupid bully. Meaning, the child molesters and the school bullies escaped and lived happily ever after; justice prevailed children.Too many fakesAnd if you think that didnU+2019t make any sense, get ready to find out how 90% of this book was a wild goose chase. Rowling had no idea of how she could fill 800 pages and just stuffed the story with impersonators and imitations of the items everybody was looking for. This did not make things more exciting; it only wasted hundreds upon hundreds of pages by going in circles, and making the plot even more convoluted than it already was.1) Harry transforms into a ginger kid and many others to Harry look-alikes in order to confuse the villains of who is the real one. He then transforms into a wizard working in the ministry so he can infiltrate the building. And then he gets captured by the villains making this whole plan pointless. He might as well have been captured right away.2) There was a pendant which was switched with a fake one, hidden in a house, where it was eventually found by the villains. You are practically reading a hundred pages of a complicating plan that had zero story progress; there was no point to even go after it in the previous book, only to find out it was fake.3) Harry needs to destroy the pendant by using the sword from the second book. But guess what, the sword which is kept in a treasury is fake. The real one is hidden somewhere else, so we spend hundreds of pages in solving riddles (which could very well be interpreted in any way you like) until they find the sword in the middle of a forest. Once that is done, it is revealed that there a chalice which they also need to destroy. And do you know where that is? In the treasury, right next to the fake sword! They needed to go there regardless.4) I am not even done yet; it gets even more convoluted. Even when Harry gets to the treasury, he doesnU+2019t even get to use the sword. It gets destroyed thus making the quest pointless.5) I am not even done yet; it gets even more convoluted. As soon as he loses the sword, it is revealed that he could have simply used the teeth of the Basilisk he killed in the second book, something which was much easier to find than the sword, rendering once again the quest for the sword completely pointless. And wait a second; if the teeth are so powerful, why didnU+2019t Dumbledore or anyone else take its teeth all these years? This entire quest could have been skipped if Rowling hadnU+2019t forgotten the chamber up until now.6) I am not even done yet; it gets even more convoluted. Another item Harry needs to destroy is a tiara, located inside a secret room which of course none of the adults could find. He gets the teeth, goes there to destroy it, and turns out he didnU+2019t need the teeth or the sword because there is a spell that can destroy the items just as easily, making both quests meaningless. Best part is that the one who used said spell to destroy the tiara, was an ally of Voltemort.7) I am not even done yet; it gets even more convoluted. The only excuse for Harry to know where the tiara is located, is by vaguely remembering he saw it in an area with millions of other stored items. Yeah, such great evidence; totally excuses why you can pinpoint exactly where it is, in a huge room, by casually looking at something, for a few seconds, without being aware of its importance. Great writing Rowling.8) I am not even done yet; it gets even more convoluted. The allies of Voltemort were waiting to ambush Harry by staying in that secret room for months. How did they know he will go there? Why didnU+2019t they simply take the tiara to a safer place first? Why did they use a spell that can destroy it? Why didnU+2019t anyone else find them all this time? How could they even be there if the place was refusing entrance to the supporters of Voltemort? If they found the room before the other teenagers used it as their base and made it Voltemort proof, why didnU+2019t they inform the evil wizards about it, when they knew about it for over a year? And above all, what the fuck were they eating for months in that place? Did they ever have a bath? It didnU+2019t even have a toilet for crying out loud.9) I am not even done yet; it gets even more convoluted. Aside from trying to find the seven items that hold VoltemortU+2019s power, everybody was also looking for three artifacts, which are again replaced all the time so nobody is certain which are the real ones and who are the current owners. By the time they figured out what is going on, the artifacts didnU+2019t matter anymore, so they might as well never had existed. Not to mention how Rowling threw in an extra quest and a bunch of background stories at the last moment which was making everything needlessly complicated.Dark Lord Harry PotterAnd amidst this bullshit is Harry freaking Potter, behaving equally as evil as Voltemort did. Just list the things he did in this book, and compare them to what the Lord of all Evil was doing all this time.- uses his allies as human shields so he can escape- cowardly knocks people unconscious by backstabbing them without any warning- tricks innocents into doing his bidding by impersonating someone they know- frees from prison everyone who is against the government- constantly penetrates places he shouldnU+2019t be in and causes chaos- enslaves those who resist him by using the mind control spell- hides like a coward under the invisibility cloak when his bullshit gets exposed- pretends to be dead so he can get away with it- pretends he came back from the dead only when the entire school is watching him so he can show offItU+2019s the exact same thing. And yet Rowling presents all that as heroic and thinks nobody is going to notice that because Voltemort looks like a fucking zombie while Harry is a victimized orphan. Fucking bullshit.No securityAnd of course the reason all that were possible is because there is no defense against anything in this stupid setting.1) There is no defense against the mind control spell. You can control anyone to do anything you want, even if itU+2019s against his will.2) There is no defense against invisibility or transmutation. Anyone can impersonate anyone else he likes and nobody will suspect a thing. You can infiltrate the most secure places on Earth in minutes because nobody pays attention to the magic alarms or has invented an anti magic barrier.3) There is no defense against elf magic. Even when Harry is imprisoned in a room that blocks teleportation, a house elf appears and frees him just like that. Why are they slaves when house elf magic is far more powerful that wizard magic and can do any shit they like? They can take over the world easier than Voltemort did.4) There is no defense against rebellious teenagers. As always, kids at the magic school were not obeying the adults, the teachers had no way to control them, or find the radio station where they were using for mocking the authorities. Also, teenagers could easily fend off huge armies of monsters despite being rookies who didnU+2019t know of a single offensive spell up until two years ago.5) There is no defense against secret passages. Hogwarts is filled with secret rooms nobody could find for a thousand years, and when Harry finds them pretty easily, they are constantly used by the rebellious teenagers, and again nobody else could find them. The adults kept saying that they blocked every single secret exist in Hogwarts, and yet Harry and the teenagers kept using even more exits to easily go in and out any time they wanted. They even went as far as evacuating the whole school despite being under siege by a huge army of monsters.6) There is no defense against good. Did you notice that throughout the whole story there are a dozen ways to fend off evil but nothing to fend off goodness? The secret room the teenagers were hiding in was Voltemort protected; meaning nobody who was evil could get in. On the other hand, the chamber of secrets from the second book, created so it can be used only by the Slitherin, does not have protection against any other faction.7) The bad guys have defenses that work only against them. They use monsters like basilisks and dragons, and spells like fiendfyre that can destroy the items holding VoltemortU+2019s power. No beast on the side of the good guys ever used it power against them. Furthermore, even after the chamber of secrets is revealed and the basilisk is killed, nobody from VoltemortU+2019s side bothers to take away the corpse despite knowing very well of its power. Also, the special password one must use to get into the chamber is in snaketongue, which despite being hyped up as something super special, anyone can get into the chamber by simply repeating the words without having to actually know the language. And of course itU+2019s so simple to remember something you heard once, 5 years ago, without feeling the need to memorize it. This plot armor is insane; the good guys can do anything, the bad guys can do shit.8) There is no defense against faking death. While Harry was faking his demise, nobody bothered to check his pulse and make sure he is really dead.9) And even in that single time when adults finally try to protect something, the booby trap they use is overkill and causes more damage than benefit.- What kind of a madman would try to stop a thief by making the gold in a treasury to multiply and turn to lava? You are effectively destroying everything you are guarding this way.- Also, what is the point of having a treasury when there is a spell that multiplies gold? Precious metals have no value when you can do that.- And as if that wasnU+2019t enough, they even had a dragon guarding the gold. How does having a huge monster stepping on the precious artifacts and breathing fire on what you are supposed to guard, counts as protecting them?- Also, how do you expect the dragon to fight the thieves when you turn the gold he is sitting on to lava?- Also, what is the point of having a dragon as a guard when a few tiny goblins can scare it and a little boy can tame it in a few seconds?- Also, did anyone notice that Harry essentially enslaved Goblins, used them as robots, and then abandoned them to be burned alive by the gold, while he shows off by riding the dragon.- The idea to make the room immune to magic is a good defense but if no magic works in there, how does the gold magically multiplies and turns to lava and how could Harry cast a spell on the wall so he could escape?- Also, how can you cast an enlargement spell on a hole, so you can make it bigger? A hole is empty space; there is nothing to enlarge. You are essentially shrinking the wall around it.- Also, why is there a hole on the wall of a treasury? How are you guarding a place when you make it so easy for someone to sneak in?Awful romanceNow letU+2019s talk a bit about how good Rowling is at writing romance. Hermione falls in love with Ron in this book, because he abandoned her. Next thing you know, she French kisses him while they ripping off the teeth from a 5 year old rotting corpse of a Basilisk. ThatU+2019s so romantic Rowling, having them kiss for no reason while everything around them stinks like shit.Awful expositionLetU+2019s also talk a bit about her wonderful exposition. Remember Snape who betrayed them in the previous book? Turns out he was faking it (thatU+2019s right, another fake) and that he is actually a good guy. Something that we the audience find out when he is already dead. He didnU+2019t even do something with his double crossing because Voltemort killed him before he had the chance to move against him. And Voltemort didnU+2019t even kill him because he found out he was a traitor. He just did it for fun, effectively making SnapeU+2019s side story completely pointless.Bullshit actionAfter that, the final battle takes place and you are left wondering when did these rookie teenagers learn all these powerful spells when two years ago they couldnU+2019t even wave a wand properly? Most of them were not even mentioned or explained before. And why donU+2019t they simply spam the enslavement spell? ItU+2019s easy to cast and can turn the enemy against himself. Or better yet, why donU+2019t they all drink the luck potion and sit back as the monsters get killed by their own attacks? See what happens when you abuse magic?Anticlimactic endingAnd then we finally get to Harry fighting Voltemort. This has to be epic, right? ItU+2019s the final battle, it just has to be. And it isnU+2019t! Harry wins by doing fucking nothing. VoltemortU+2019s spell bounces back and kills him in the exact same way as before. Fucking horseshit. Harry did zero things in the whole story and the villain defeated himself three times in a row. These books are garbage and anyone who still defends them is a filthy casual who doesnU+2019t like good storytelling, logical plot, proper foreshadowing, proper action scenes, or anything related to good writing. The end."},

The epidemic, of course, would be all those people who want to talk about Harry Potter without me having read the last book. The vaccine, then, would be finally reading the book. I suppose that last comparison isn't exactly flattering, but don't let my poor comparison interfere in any way with the greatness of this book/series. In my last review of Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, I complained about having to set apart time for reading Potter books since my life grinds to a halt until I finish. Last time it was a week of scout camp that came to my rescue. This time, however, I knew there was no way I would last until summer without a major plot point being revealed, but I was so dreadfully busy I could not fathom how I could find any time to squeeze the Deathly Hallows in. Cue an ugly stomach sickness. I never thought I would be so glad to be sick in all my life. My churning, volcanic stomach was the perfect excuse to pick up Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. And this time I didn't need a week; I only needed two days (which for me, usually a deliberate reader, was quite an accomplishment). Ever since the Prisoner of Azkaban, I've always known that the Harry Potter books were a unique endeavor and a noted achievement. But it wasn't until Deathly Hallows, after being zipped around, yanked from one place to another, rocketed towards the finale, and then masterfully escorted through a complicated, yet brilliant and succinct climax, that I realized that I was reading one of the finest pieces of literature that I've ever set my hands on--not a conlcusion that I came to lightly. It wasn't until the conclusion that I realized that the Harry Potter series is more than just a really great story with an extremely clever plot--Harry Potter is a written work that exposes truths of human nature and experience in a way that few other authors, contemporary or \"classic,\" are able to achieve. As I read through the final chapters, I realized that I was reading something that would be attached to my inner core for the rest of my life, and while I might forget details, I would never forget that Rowling really struck the right note, really revealed truths ... and who would have thought she would have done it with a seventeen year old wizard and his friends? As for the book itself, it starts out quickly and already, even with the Dursleys, hints towards the reconciliation that you find throughout the book. The middle part of the book plods, but even as I read and recognized this, I knew it was on purpose. The slowing of the plot reflected the experience of Harry, Hermione, and Ron and sets the reader in the mood for what the characters are going through. And just when you are about to say that you've had enough, Rowling starts the quick unraveling until the very end. Momentum picks up, problems are solved, but even more remain unresolved, the escapes and close calls mount until you feel as if you're reading one per page. Everything is set up for an impressive, epic, and final showdown, and this is where Rowling takes her masterful stroke. She stops everything. In the thick of the action, she stops it all and has some time for reflection. Certainly daring, but such a move in any other circumstance might be considered unwise at the least and extreme folly at the most (I believe Ron would call it \"mental\"). In this case, it's brilliant. It refocuses the story on what really matters, why it matters to us as readers, and makes all of the epic preparations seem paltry compared to the thoughts and reflections of the protagonist that we feast on at the end. When the climax comes, you're already satisfied--you don't even care how it turns out because Rowling has taught you something true that will ring true no matter what else happens. And, while she did skim over some of the loose ends in the plot extremely quickly after that point, I think I prefer that to a long, drawn out explanation at the end. She made her point, and I didn't need to see anything else. For that matter, neither do you. If you haven't had the vaccine yet, get it.Thank you, J.K. Rowling. "},

Rowling's new Harry Potter book on the day it came out. This is the final Potter, and after 10 years of following the series I was pretty interested to see how it would all turn out with Harry and his coterie are on the lamb and everything is going to hell now that the chief bad guy is seizing control of the wizarding world.One of the things that I've always admired about this series is how they started off being childish and fanciful, then matured into more and more sophisticated, dark, and --oddly enough-- realistic books. The Deathly Hallows takes this trend to its conclusion, and not just because the body count is so alarmingly high by the end. I loved how this book looks full into the face of an issue that every one of us has had to deal with on our road towards adulthood: adults are flawed and fallible. And I'm not just talking about the bad guys here. I mean our friends fail us. Our authority figures fail us. Our parents fail us. But it's only because they're real, complex people and we can't see that until we've done some aging ourselves. I loved how Hallows expands on this theme by showing us how people like Dumbledore and even Harry's dad were, at least once, worse people than we thought they were, and how others like Snape and even the Malfoys are better than we thought they were. Rowling teases apart the simple, bold lines she used to draw her characters in the beginning of the series so that they are now possessed of shades and nuances that weren't there before. And yet it flows naturally and you can see that the groundwork was often laid thousands of pages ago.The other thing to love about Hallows is, of course, that it's a rip-roaring good adventure. Despite the disappointing fact that it falls back on the tired old cliche of the quest to collect all the magicle foozles (actually, there are two sets of foozles in play here) so they can be combined/destroyed lest they save/explode the world, our favorite wizardly teens go from one exciting scene to the next. Well, mostly. I could have done with a lot less of the clomping around in the woods that goes on in the middle of the book, but otherwise it's just good entertainment. And things culminate in (MINOR SPOILER!!) a battle royale at Hogwarts towards the end of the book in which just about every major and minor character from the series gets called in to take the safeties off their wands and totally cut loose. That was just plain fun.I did have a few problems with the book, but they were mostly minor. It dragged in the middle, as I said, to the point where it seemed like Rowling was just padding it out. I had also have had QUITE enough of Emo Potter and his hissy fit ways in the previous couple of installments, so that I was banging the book against my head when Harry started to get all pissy and emotional to the point of sundering his friendships. Thankfully Rowling moved on, in the name of character development if nothing else.My only substantial disappointment with Gallows was how it lacked the sense of discovery and world building that earlier books had. What I loved about the early parts of the series was that Rowling's impressive imagination was on full display, meted out in revelations about the wizarding world, its mechanics, its societies, its places, its people, and its, well, magic. I loved finding out what she was going to think of next because it was entertaining and delightful. Hallows, on the other hand, is in full wrap-up mode. We get very little new except the chaos and loss that came out of breaking down everything we had come to know at that point. Still, I guess Rowling had to stop introducing new stuff at some point so that she could wrap it up even if the sense of wonder and discovery is greatly reduced.So, thumbs up from me. The last 100 pages of the book create what is one of the most satisfying endings to an epic series that I can remember, and I'm really glad I've read the books. I hope that my kids read and enjoy them some day. It'll be fun to talk about them."},

A lot oThe Deathly Hallows rips me apart in so many ways, and still leaves me with a feeling of hope and happiness. There's so much death and a loss of innocence, and some of these deaths STILL have me upset, and I read this book for the first time eight years ago. At the same time, however, it's a fantastic book, with great themes of acceptance, death, love, and good triumphing over evil, and it's a wonderful conclusion.Deathly Hallows takes chances, and that's something I appreciate about it. A lot of people have problems with the wandering around in forests stage of the book, but I think it's incredibly brave of Rowling to do, BECAUSE it is so anti-climatic. But that's REALISTIC. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are teenagers thrown into a world of death and destruction; all three are wanted by the Death Eaters for either being friends with muggle-borns or being one themselves. The world is in turmoil, and it's very much like World War II, with muggle-borns being persecuted and killed simply because of their birth status. There's a heavy prejudice in the wizarding world, and Harry and his friends are the only ones who can fix it. That's a lot of pressure for three 17-year-olds, especially as Dumbledore left them very little to go on. So OF COURSE they're going to spend a long time meandering about, trying to figure out what to do. That being said, once things get going, they go. There are some really great action sequences, and the Battle of Hogwarts is one of my favorites in all the books; it's rich, it's complex, it's sad, and it shows how much the characters have all grown. I also love the scene at Malfoy Manor and Gringotts, and the scene at Godric's Hollow still creeps me out.Deathly Hallows answers all the questions that have been brewing since Sorcerer's Stone, and does so in such an interesting, satisfying way. I love all the explanations of how and why things are, and Dumbledore's backstory is heartbreaking and wonderful to read.And oh, the tears. So many tears. Deathly Hallows is one of the few books I don't like to read in front of others; I need to be alone, so I can be with the characters and my grief of losing them, and coming to terms with the end of the series.THE ONE THING I WOULD CHANGE:There's a theory that says the prophecy, which states \"Neither can live while the other survives\" could mean that neither can die EXCEPT by the hand of the other, therefore making Harry immortal. I think this ending would have been a more powerful one, simply because at this point, Harry is not afraid of death. We know that. He's proven that to us. Death is the only way he can be with those he loves: his parents, Sirius, Lupin, etc; so isn't it MORE of a sacrifice for him to never die and join them? I think so. That's my only change I'd make. That, and the epilogue, simply because we didn't need it, and it was just too cheesy. I would've preferred to end with the trio, or with Harry alone. --I love Harry Potter. This reread has proven that the love is still there, still strong, and still a huge part of my life. When I got my Deathly Hallows/scar tattoo, my mom believed I'd regret it, that I'd \"grow out\" of Harry Potter. At this point, it's been 20 years since the first book came out, and I'm still in love with it as ever."},

It all endsU+2026NO! As I picked up the last book in the highly acclaimed and spectacular Harry Potter series, I could not comprehend the fact that it was coming to an end. I began reading JK RowlingU+2019s incredible fantasy series when I was HarryU+2019s age at eleven and was thrust into the most remarkable world, where my dreams were brought vividly to life and which sparked my imagination so that it could soar cloud high. Her books have not only touched many childrenU+2019s lives but also teenagers who can relate to the three main characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione as they grow-up but also adults too because of the strong themes of love and death within. This series although fantasy and un-real (which I did believe to be real for many years!), is based on our own real world and lives as we explore life and death, human emotion and that most powerful of emotions; love. Harry is a significant part of my life for I have grown up with him and have experienced similar occurrences and happenings, as him and his other Hogwarts friends have for the writing epitomized a childU+2019s life and through teenage years; that were tough. HarryU+2019s story is one that touched my heart and soul and which is now buried deep within, as although it has ended it shall certainly live on forever in all of our lives as JK Rowling gave her gift to the world. In this spectacular, intensely gripping conclusion we follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they leave the walls of Hogwarts School to embark on a journey into the unknown in search of the hidden Horcruxes, with the aim of defeating the darkness and killing Voldemort. The magical world has changed since the Death eaters took control of the Ministry of Magic (with the horrid Delores Umbridge at its centre), and even within the school walls where no one is longer safe. As the number of killings per day rise the time is very much remicent of all those years ago when Voldemort rose to power last time, and so Harry and his friends must uncover the secrets before it is too late and before anyone else dear to him gets hurt. No one can be trusted as Nagini lies in wait for Harry when he takes a trip to see Godrics Hollow and the home of his parents, which is a real U+2018stingU+2019 and which is a stark reminder of what Harry is fighting for. As the great battle draws near and one by one members of the Order of the Phoenix succumb to the terrors of the dark mark, Hogwarts prepares to fight as too does everyone who holds love in their heartsU+2026full of epic battle scenes, heartache and the most cutting act of all when Belatrix Lestrange kills Dobby this is a book that really does tug at the heartstrings of human emotion and which pierced a hole in my heart so that I bled inwardly. The Harry Potter series is truly an astonishing piece of fiction and which has not only impacted upon our imaginations but upon life itself, hence what JK Rowling has achieved can only be described as something so great that not even a genius of their craft could compare. I cannot praise this fantastic, outstanding conclusion and the most thrilling, nail-biting, powerful ending to one of the greatest fictional series EVER therefore if I was able to give it a hundred stars I would (rather than 5)U+2026.

This book didn't quite hold up. It's a high 4 though.Early on I was definite I wanted to drop it 4, but as I got closer to the end I was less sure. I'm still a little iffy on it. This is really a story of two halves. The first half is slow sometimes to the point of being tedious.I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. I certainly felt as frustrated as the characters at their lack of progress.The second half of the book is truly excellent. The first part is what spoils a 5 star for me though. I'm trying to be a bit more frugal with what I give 5 stars to, to give that rating a bit more meaning. Cover to Cover this book just wasn't as enjoyable to me as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban or Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.That said, I love this book and I for one am happy with the ending. I have this perception that many(some?) people were upset at the epilogue. I've heard complaints that Ms. Rowling left nothing to the imagination.In some books that would bother me. For Harry Potter, it does not. I think if I had to imagine what would happen next, the Epilogue is exactly what I'd have wanted."},

The culprit? Harry Potter. I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning finishing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows. My drive to finish the book wasnU+2019t fanaticismU+2014it was spoilers.

I knew if I didnU+2019t finish the book before work, it would be ruined for me.Keeping this in mind, I will not ruin the book for anyone else. Instead, IU+2019ll just make some general observations:Library employees have been speculating for days (actually years) about what would happen in the book. They have reread the previous six books for clues. I did not participate in this speculation because I am lucky if I can even remember what I wore last weekU+2014let alone the intricate details of books I read years ago. However, many of their speculations were correct, so kudos to them. Like I mentioned before, I have little interest in moody teenagers, and this book abounds in them. There were several moments when I wanted to give both Harry and Ron a slap. They are on the most important journey of their lives and they act like petulant two year olds? Give me a break. I hate unnecessary epilogues. They detract from the integrity of a book. That is all I shall say. Just because she is a billionaire does not mean that J.K. Rowling does not need an editor. I may be drawn-and-quartered for saying so, but The Deathly Hollows was way too long. The book could have easily been half the length without sacrificing anything. In fact, chopping out all the unnecessary drivel would have made the book stronger. Do I have to know every single person who attends a wedding and what they are wearing? No. Another problem with making the book so long is that readers are rushed to get to the meat of the story and may lose out on important details in their hurry. Of course, none of my criticisms will stop anyone from reading the book. After all, if you are reading the seventh book, in all likelihood, you have also read the six books before it. Having made such a huge commitment, The Deathly Hollows could be the worst book ever, and everyone would still read it just to know what happens. It isnU+2019t the worst book ever, and nothing could have stopped me from reading it either."},

This last novel has many plotlines to wrap-up and covers the disillusionment that happens as we come of age and into the adult world. Admittedly Harry is coming to it at a very dark time in this fictional universe but Rowling does show the tears that happen and the depth of questioning that is left behind when we lose someone. There is a great deal of wandering about aimlessly. It might have been illustrated with less prosaic filler unless of course there was a need to depict every ... last.. campsite .. they ... stopped .. at.. While worthy of a travelogue it drags on -- making the novel drag, not to mention the loss of time perspective by the core characters is a bit silly (they were getting papers) and at the very least I don't think Hermione is that un-organized. I feel there were a few odd things about this novel. For one it isn't ever quite explained why Ron must be the one to destroy the locket horcrux - unless it is as a method to illustrate what the reader should have found obvious about his feelings regarding his two best friends. It might have been better addressed in another manner, however it does bring him back into the main plotline and gives him something to do. For another how did Neville get the sword after the goblin took it? (Possibly I might have missed that bit but I don't think so)But despite all of that we find out quite a bit as the novel goes on its way. There are highs and lows emotionally, as well as challenges. The end is of course quite exciting and while fans are left with the taste for more I felt it wrapped up quite well all things considered. I'd like to also take a moment and make note of the lovely illustrations throughout the novels of this series done by Mary GrandPrU+00E9. They are delightful. I will leave you with an amusing image that has little to do with my reading of this last novel in the series.. just my amusement. "},

I bought it at a midnight release party, devoured it, and knew that I loved it.But now that I've spent the last couple of weeks reading it aloud to my son, I understand why I loved it so much. Does anyone fully appreciate the scope of what Rowling did with this book? She spent years upon years, and six other books building a world and populating it with characters, and then she BROUGHT IT AND THEM ALL TOGETHER. Spells, tools, people, events, that had been sprinkled throughout the other six books were now smoothly woven together into this last great battle. And yes, they spend a lot of time camping, but as Harry says to Ron, \"Did you think we'd be finding a Horcrux a day?\" No, I didn't, or at least I hoped that they wouldn't, because that would have been too pat, too unrealistic. Instead, they had to search, they had to learn, they had to struggle, and be bored, and be lost, and then find what they needed. The Ron-Harry-Hermione friendship is tested, and found to be unbreakable. Ron and Hermione's relationship moves forward, Harry has time to reflect on his life, the people who have helped him, what his future might hold.And I loved it. I loved the moments of solemn reflection. I loved the testing of loyalties, revelations about the youth of Dumbledore and Snape (and if you don't bawl like a baby reading about Snape's memories, YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Lily and even Petunia. There are no throwaway characters in Rowling's world, yet it isn't just some endless catalogue of: And Dean did this, and Neville did this . . . Everything is part of one whole, beautiful story. The Weasleys continue to show their strength and love for Harry (and if you don't cry when Percy shows up, or when Fred . . . you know . . . YOU HAVE NO SOUL!), Neville proves that he is his parents' son, and a true Gryffindor . . . and in short, there are so many stand up and cheer moments that I couldn't sit still while I was reading it. Of course, there are many, many tragedies, but after each tragedy, a moment of triumph to balance it, for which I say:Thank you, J. K. Rowling, for creating one of the best, most magical series for children of all time. Thank you for giving us Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred and George, Ginny and Luna, and so many wonderful moments.And thank you, most of all, for not screwing up the grand finale.Best. Series ender. Ever."},

I'm just gonna list some reasons I love this book, this series, so much. - The characters.  I just want it to be on the record Harry James Potter is one of my top five favourite characters. He is just SUCH A GOOD PERSON. I admire his bravery, his selflessness and his determination ( and also he's literally the most savage person his roasts are life ) I love so much about him - I love that he's not perfect either. He can be mean, arrogant, literally annoying asf but I LOVE HIM. He makes me so emotional, like he actually breaks my heart. Thats why this book is actual crack for me. There is so much of it relating to Harry's parents, his past, his childhood. There is so much about him having to do the right thing even though it's hard, even though he's suffering, even though people have literally been fucking with him for years he does the right thing anyway I JUST LOVE HIM ALOT Other characters, Ron man. Ron. He fucks up bad but he comes back and he redeems himself and urggh I love him. His loyalty is amazing, but he's such a real character. I love how he (quite literally) is able to conquer (stab with a sword) his demons and his character development is amazing and he's just so funny and such a good friend he's my son ?? I love him. HERMIONE I honestly can't say anything except wife me she's so inspirational and passionate and sticks to her beliefs even when they're unpopular and I honestly just love her and the trio so much ?Deathly Hallows is just so good like lets recap on some highlights.  --> Opens on Dudley actually accepting Harry and thanking him --> Wild broom chase, crazy sky wand fights and I'm Holey Fred ... get it ? --> Ron fighting his mother about the wedding. Harry and Ginny. Horcrux planning.  --> Coffee shop death eater skirmish --> REGULUS ARCTURUS BLACK --> Lily's letter --> KREACHER --> Ministry break-in. Harry sticking it to Umbridge --> Potterwatch --> GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN ?!?! --> The DA resisting in Hogwarts, magical graffiti that says Dumbledore's Army, Still Recruiting! --> Speaking of Dumbledore, just the entirely of his and Aberforths family story --> Godrics Hollow. Harry seeing James & Lily's graves and the house. Heartbreaking but beautiful --> THE BIT WHEN NEVILLE WIPES OUT NAGINI --> Snape's story --> Everything coming together so beautifully at the end aND THE GRAND HALL SCENE --> Harry mending the Phoenix wand  --> Teddy Lupin existing --> Harry getting to see his parents/Sirius/Lupin say what he's always wanted to crying bye --> like the whole book tbh ?? I love it ??I could say alot about the beautiful messages and sybolism. I could say about the beautiful and poignant way Harry's grief and loss about his parents is dealt with, or talk about the perfect symbolism of Voldermort's death - and how it shows that he was not special but just a regular man who was devoid of love and took his quest for power way too far. I could talk about how Voldermort's soul is represented and what Voldermort represents for humanity but I wouldn't be the first and I won't be the last and I would have too much to say anyway (and no way to say it how I wanna)So instead I'll just say I adore this book, forever and always. I adore this series and everything it gave me. I love that it created such a wonderful and expansive world I wanna live in. I love that it gave me characters who were my friends growing up. I love that it's defined my childhood and become to important to me and I can't believe it came out nearly ten years ago. I love it so much, forever. "},

And when he \"kills\" Harry, don't you think that a wizard mastermind who's been foiled by this stupid boy as many times as he had, would go make sure the little prat is dead himself? Like he'd go poke him with his wand or something?10. Hermione, in every other book, has had some sort of thing that only she can figure out, but in this book she suddenly becomes this little wussy girl that lets Harry walk all over her.--It took me FOUR days to read this book. FOUR!!! I - little miss read the HP books in ten hours straight - put this book down volutarily for three nights in a row.

What is so compelling about these children's books? The well-woven archetypes, the mystery, the imaginative combination of fantasy and fancy? As another blogger put it, the books are overflowing with story. Never once are they a method for JK to assuage her vanity as a writer, because the writing itself isn't deep, their success is a result of Rowling being an increadibly steady storyteller whose approach has more than a few similarities to classic storytelling. Her main three characters account for the three things Aristotle named as the only necessary ingredients in successful rhetoric - Ethos (Harry) Pathos (Ron) and Logos (Hermione). She extends this to all aspects of the Harry Potter world, to houses in Hogwarts, their respective teachers, as well as borrowing latin for names of spells and words from other languages as names for characters-- Malfoy (quoting wikipedia) is derived from Old French \"mal foi\" or \"mal foy,\" which means \"bad faith\" or \"bad trust\". The Old French mal foy itself is derived from Latin mala fide, which as a judicial term means intentional mischief, ill will or evil intentions.(/quoting wikipedia) Grimmauld place is also a pun on \"grim old place.\" As far as the pacing, it takes into realistic account the rest and hunger the characters go through with no detail spared as to when and what the characters eat. For some reason this makes a story more effective to me, call me weird, I like reading about people eating. Though while I read the Odyssey this made me put the book down more than a few times because it made me hungry. Anyhow, the constant thread through these books was the final showdown that had to happen between Harry and Voldemort, though I think I would have read them anyway for her generously detailed fantastic world...I was surprised Harry didn't die. I really thought it was going to happen and was a little disappointed with the end, mostly because the meeting with Dumbledore in the train station purgatory was a bit much of a deus ex machina for me. I know she had to vindicate Dumbledore and I thought that was fine but something about it was too clean and easy without her usual foreshadowing. I knew Snape would be vindicated in the end! I loved how she rounded out his story, all that was perfect. I was a huge fan of the way in which Rowling discredited the phrase \"for the greater good\" probably much to the confusion of most of her younger readers. Was a little taken aback at the vague comparison of that to the holocaust, how she wrote something like \"for the greater good\" was on the gates of a place where Grindewald killed people but it drove the point home. The Elder Wand ownership thing was...it was like she painted herself into a corner and had to get it resolved before she could finish the book, made the final duel a bit too, er, complex. But my favorite moment in all of these books came at the end of chapter 35 right before Harry regains consciousness for the final battle. It was the most elegant way to finish out this series that has made millions of children into avid readers:\"Tell me one last thing,\" said Harry. \"Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?\"Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry's ears even though the bright mist was descending again obscuring his figure.\"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\""},

I would bring these books with me everywhere and do my best to sneak away to read; dinners at relatives, soccer tournaments, any kind of trip... I've re-read these books more times than I can ever remember and I still love them just the same. It's just this huge part of my life. All of these characters are. And so, this final book, with so much nostalgia, love, death and horror filling it's pages... *takes deep breath*  \"NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!\"I'm not even sure what I'm trying to say. This book is fantastic in my opinion, the series as a whole is, and I love it so very, very much. I'm basically shaky with emotions. I've laughed, cried, chuckled with tear-filled eyes... No matter how many times I read this book, I experience the same thing. No matter that I know what is coming; perhaps that even makes it harder. I guess I just wanna say that it is a huge favorite of mine, holding a spot no other book or series could ever take from my heart. And I love whenever I have the opportunity to visit this world, and these wonderful and lovable characters, all over again.   \"'After all this time?''Always,' said Snape.\""},

As I had said before, I didn't really love this series before this reread - I simply liked it, and that was enough for me to not get the fweels and not to be in pain because of all the deaths that happened.Deaths which, by the way, made the book better and worse at the same time. Worse because duh, characters we learned to love no longer were; and better... because well, doesn't that prove how brave an author Rowling is? She doesn't go the safe, sugar-coated way. She goes in the painful and realistic one, even though this was not supposed to be a book for adults.This book is not my favourite in the series (that place goes for both The Goblet of Fire and The Prisoner of Azkaban), but it's still brilliant. The plot gets more complex than before, it's more action-packed and intense, and all the loose strings in the series finally get attached, that is to say, the missing explanations are given and the last twists delivered, some of which include this:Oh, Snape. A complex character, that one was. I never hated him. I admit sometimes I loathed him when he was unfair towards his students, but it was passing anger and I got over it; besides, he was a damn genius in Potion-making and magic in general. Now after reading book 7, I realised I actually feel kind of bad for him. All the life he didn't have... and all because he wallowed in his past.I'm eternally grateful for my decision of rereading this series. During it, I infected my brothers with HP obsession love, and I finally became one of those people who see the world of HP as real as our Muggle world, because as Albus Dumbledore said,Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?It'd be a lie if I say I'll never get over this series - I've gotten over worse things (i.e. The Monstrumologist) - but nonetheless I'll never forget about this journey, and of course, I'll always keep it in my heart, no matter how cheesy and unlike me that sounds."},

Many plotlines of previous books are barely touched upon (S.P.E.W.) or \"resolved\" in an entirely dissatisfactory manner (Grawp, though I wasn't unhappy about not seeing more of him). Characters who were hyped in interviews but turned out to be of little importance include Ginny Weasley, who winds up doing absolutely nothing of relevance throughout the whole book, whereas she was annoyingly and tediously present (and acting like a complete jerk) in Half-Blood Prince. Despite my dislike of this character, I had expected to see much more of her, and I was disappointed to see her true purpose was bearing Harry Potter's childrens in one of the, if not the, least believable \"romances\" of the series.The book, and the series, then end with a cloying epilogue which tells us little about things that actually matter and instead focuses on who marries who, complete with precocious children (who are naturally of similar ages; so considerate of everyone to get pregnant at the same time!) and insipid names (Albus Severus, but no child named after Ginny's dead brother?). I like to pretend this epilogue, or \"crapilogue\" as disappointed fans have dubbed it, doesn't exist, and that the series officially ends after Harry kills Voldemort. Leaves much more to the imagination and is much more of a fitting end.My expectations prior to the release were faily high. That turned out to be a mistake. I won't be rereading this installment any time soon, possibly not ever again."},

Especially since it is the conclusion to such a beautiful series.Plot:My Blurb:Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived, The Chosen One, is supposed to be in his last year at Hogwarts, enjoying the time with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.Instead, he has been forced to grow up fast, suffering through death, hardships, and even duels.Still stricken by the death of one of the most important people in his life, Harry sets off with Ron and Hermione to find the remaining Horcruxes that will destroy Lord Voldemort.The task proves a daunting one, but with the help of his friends, and some unknown people, he may be able to succeed.If he does, he may finally be able to put an end to the evil in his world, creating a better place for all.My Commentary:This book.This. Book.It killed me.Harry and his friends have to go through a lot of crap in this book. The bias, the society, the prejudice.Harry has to hide his face everywhere he goes, even at Bill and Fleur's wedding. Almost everyone is against him, and those who we think are with him, well, some of them end up betraying the trust. Some of them are people we would never expect that from. And then there are the people who we thought for sure were against Harry but end up being on his side.I can't even express how much this book infuriated, overjoyed, excited, scared, and everything me.Characters:Harry Potter:Harry is still pretty perfect. He forgives Dumbledore, he forgives Snape, he forgives Ron, he tries to save Peter Pettigrew, he saves Draco and his cronies, he even gives Voldemort a chance. I mean, seriously, this guy? Amazing.Harry knows what it takes to save everyone; he knows very well that this could end in his death. But he is willing to sacrifice that if it means keeping everyone else safe.For that, I admire him as a character and as a person. His development throughout this series is incredible and the changes he brings to the Wizarding world are even greater.Ron Weasley:Ron has to once again deal with the pressure of being The Boy Who Lived's best friend. He has to fight his feelings for one of his best friends since he does not want to hurt his other friend. He is struggling still to find his own destiny without being shadowed by Harry Potter's. He's not really sure where he fits into all the plans until he finds it himself.Hermione Granger:Hermione. God, Hermione. She is so fierce, so strong, so passionate. She changes her parents' memories to be like she never existed. If that's not a savage move right there, I don't know what is. She sticks with Harry even when Ron gives up on him, and she does not waver from the quest. She knows what they need to do and she is not ready to surrender.Ginny Weasley:I love this girl. She is not afraid to kick butt or to show that she can. She will defend herself and the people she loves until she can't anymore. She is so much like Harry; they are the perfect match.She, Luna, and Neville, along with a ton of other Hogwarts students, kept the D.A. running so that they could support Harry from afar. That is just so great. I love Ginny.Luna Lovegood:Luna Lovegood? Oh! You mean my favorite character EVER? That Luna Lovegood?She is eccentric and odd, but with that brings her uniqueness and strength. She is her own person completely and does not hesitate to express herself. Even when held captive, Luna does not waver but spends her time trying to find a way to escape with the others. Harry admires her so, Ron thinks she is just the greatest thing, and Hermione is one of her best friends. Luna's personality is so great, and I wish I had someone like her in my life.Neville Longbottom:Neville, the awkward, clumsy, dim Neville Longbottom, has transformed into a hero. He helped Harry defeat Voldemort. Not in a small, cheesy way, but in a HUGE, nessecary way. He was scared and impressionable, but he helped the D.A. and the journey to defeating Voldemort in an incredible way.I just love this chubby, awkward kid. And I love Matthew Lewis in the movies but for reasons other than his personality. . . .Draco Malfoy:He is just one of those villains I can't bring myself to hate. His personality was terrible, yes, but beneath all of that, he was a vulnerable boy whose choices were fogged by his parents. He did not get to choose who he was. His entire life, he spent it shadowed in the legacy of his father, Lucius Malfoy, the Death Eater.He was not evil. He wasn't really a villain.He was the son who never got a choice. He was a young man who needed a second chance. He was a student, like all others, who needed to learn. He was just a boy who needed saving, even if he didn't want to admit it.Plus I ship Dramione, so there's that.Fred Weasley:*sniff**stifles sobs*George Weasley:I cannot express my love for these twins. My sympathy for George is immeasurable. For the whole family it is.I don't think George is ever ok after what happens in the Battle of Hogwarts. I don't think he ever healed wholly, but I do believe that his family helped him. He found a wife, I know, and they had 2 kids. Roxanne and Fred.Of course, there was Fred. Of course he cried, he hurt, he yelled. Of course his children wondered why their dad cried and why their mum had to comfort him. Fred wanted to know whose memeories it was that made his dad smile. George told his kids stories, I'm sure. They know who Uncle Fred is, even if they won't meet him.I hope George got better. I really do.Bill and Fleur Weasley:Geez, The Golden Trio owes Bill and Fleur their lives. He kept them safe when they barely escaped from death. They healed Hermione after she was tortured. They . . . gave up the spot in their yard . . . I can't . . .Percy Weasley:I had honestly forgotten about Percy until he showed up again. In the beginning books, I liked him, then I hated him, and now I love him. He's still not a huge character, but he is sorry, and he has a heart, which is what matters.Molly Weasley:This lady. She accepted Harry as her own even when her family was already so big. She would do anything for her family. She was devestated when she lost one, she was fierce when she fought for one, and she loved when she saw all of them.She was ready to sacrifice herself for her children and she used the only mildly violent curse word in the whole series for herself. Of course, there were Ron's frequent outbursts, but really, Molly gets the fame.She took on Bellatrix for her daughter. And! And! She defeated her!Molly Weasley, everyone.Arthur Weasley:His excitement with the Muggle world is great. He has such a curious mind that wants to explore everything. This is usually something reserved for a child, but Arthur has it too.Remus Lupin:The last Marauder standing. I guess a group that tight knit must all have similar destinies.He is such an amazing guy. All around. Sure there were times where I was annoyed with him because he didn't appreciate Tonks, or he was going to leave his son, or he was going to sacrifice everything, but in the end, I cried for him.When he asked Harry to be the godfather for his son, I was so touched. I had so many feelings combined into one ball of emotion, and I'll admit that I teared up.He would be such a wonderful dad, no matter what he thought.He may have denied his love for Tonks, but it did show in this book. It was a messy, complicated relationship, but beautiful nonetheless.Nymphadora Tonks:Tonks is supportive, protective, and determined. Her first thought in the battle was of her husband's safety, and their journeys finished together. They brought a new life into the world, and yes, their son may be confused as to why his mum and dad left him, but he will be loved. He will have Andromeda, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Ginny, the kids, everyone.Anyway, this is about Tonks, not Teddy. She is hilarious too. Her hair and her features and \"Don't call me Nymphadora.\"Oh, Tonks . . .Severus Snape:Snape, Snape, Severus Snape.So . . . Some of you are going to hate me for saying this but . . .I still don't really like him.*winces* Is it over?I know, I know! His story, Lily, jealousy! Yes, it's all very heartbreaking, and I like him a lot more than I used to, but I still don't really like him.All those years, he was terrible to Harry. Maybe it was to protect him, because he reminded Snape of the Potters. I don't deny that, but at the same time, just because Snape loved Lily, I can't forgive him for all he has done.Snape was Neville's boggart. His biggest fear.Harry was not scared of Snape as Neville was, no, but he was intimidated by him.James Potter may have been a bully when he was a teenager, but Snape grew into a bully. Snape chose the dark arts over Lily; James changed for the woman he loved. That was the difference.Not that I'm glad Snape is gone, because I think he deserved a chance to redeem himself to Harry or prove that he wasn't evil, but I after going through all the tormenting with Harry though the books, I just can't bring myself to forgive him as Harry did.Harry, you are a much more forgiving person than I.Minerva McGonagall:She is such a savage, this lady. Her wizard mind tricks (and physical tricks) are what make her so cool. My love for her can't be expressed in words. And when she was upset about Harry, I loved her even more.She is such a fierce lady and she should he headmaster. I don't know what I would do without her. Haha.Voldemort:He comes last. Ol' Voldy. Probably the most evil of them all. Except for Umbridge of course. But this isn't about her.I think that he thought what he was doing was ok. He thought it was for the good of the Wizarding World. It was not, but he didn't know. His childhood and adulthood were demented and tortured. He didn't know what was wrong and what was right.Harry gave him a chance to apologize for his wrongdoings. Harry gave him a chance to be human again.Voldemort didn't want to be human. He wanted to be the monster he was. But in the end, he died with \"mundane finality\", showing that he was really just Tom Riddle.Author:Good old JK. She is so brilliant. Her story is an inspiring one that proves to everyone that nothing is really impossible if you have enough nerve. If we're quoting Ginny.She went through such a dark time, but she turned it around. Now she is a wife, a mother, she is happy. And that's all anyone could ever ask for: happiness.Recommended To:I doubt there are many people who haven't read Harry Potter, but I didn't read it for the first time until now, and that's WAY behind everyone else, just like I tell you about below. But everyone needs to read these books.Overall:This was my last read of 2015. It was a great finale. The twists, the turns, and the loops send you for a wild ride in this book. I could not have asked for a better conclusion to Harry Potter and to 2015.I am definitely glad I read them. Most people read these when they were 9 or 10. I did start the first book in 3rd or 4th grade, I think, but I didn't really enjoy it. Now, I am glad I picked them up. Thank God for my neighbor who lent them and the movies to me or I never would have gone back to these books. I would have remembered picking them up and ended it there. Now I have completed the reading, no matter how long it took me, and at no matter what age (ugh, 14), but it finally happened!I may not have grown up with these books or had them shape my life, but they have built within me a deeper appreciation for literature itself, those who did shape their lives around these books, and for the great novelty of this series.Everyone needs to know the story of Harry Potter, his friends, his family, his determination, his passion, his forgiveness, his selflessness, his bravery, his sacrifice, and most of all, his strength. Because his strength, will make you stronger. And everyone could use a little more strength.For lack of any possibly better word, this was a truly magical series."},

I don't want to spoil your world view.Sexuality, Adolescence and Harry PotterOne of the funny things about the original discussion and the response to it is the lack of recognition of how important sexuality actually (and overtly) is to HP, especially later in the series.It defies me how people expect someone to write about or think about or progress through adolescence without considering sex or sexuality.Heartstring Wands and Love TrianglesFor me, HP is a love triangle in which there is enormous sexual tension around who will end up with Hermione by the time they escape the chains of adolescence.Obviously, JKR for her own reasons avoids the obvious temptation to let Harry end up with Hermione.However, right up until the last moment, there is some doubt as to whether Ron will get the girl.It's totally misguided to think that HP's adolescent audience isn't right on top of this issue.In fact, they're probably way ahead of most adults in the audience (including me).Let's DanceIn the first Deathly Hallows film, Harry and Hermione dance together, while Ron remains banished in the wild.This was a tipping point in the story, when Hermione might possibly have reversed her sexual selection.When I saw the film, a whole group of kids burst out laughing in this scene.I still don't know whether I missed something (was it Harry's seriousness or clumsiness?), but I was too busy concentrating on the soundtrack and trying to work out its significance.The Ship Song[I wrongly thought] the song was Nick Cave's \"The Ship Song\", which was the last thing I expected to hear in a HP film.It's a great melody, but if you have a look at the lyrics, you have to wonder what was intended by the director, at least.http://www.stlyrics.com/songs/n/nickc...Did Harry create a \"little mystery\" with Hermione?Did Hermione loose her dogs on Harry? Or let her hair hang down?Did Harry have to remove her wings, so that she could try to fly in her own right?Did Hermione have to escape Harry's legendary pull, so she could find happiness?I wish I could have asked those kids.Post Script:I just asked my 12 year old daughter why people laughed at that scene, and she said (in this order) \"because they weren't together\" (i.e., a recognised couple) and \"because they were goofy\".

It would have been rather ironic, considering the fact that he's been the object of every one's disdain--which would have made an outright act of heroism all the more outstanding. I understand that he made a significant contribution to Harry's safety, and Snape's storyline was heartbreaking and interesting...but he could have openly faced Voldermort. He could have raged and fought--he was a powerful wizard, after all... Snape should have gone out with a bang, I think--instead of a blood-soaked whimper. Also..The necklace around Ron's neck...bringing all of his envy and mistrust to the surface...Where have we seen this before? (just take a glance at the Lord of the Rings)...Harry and Ron have already had that fight about inequity in popularity...been there, done that...Why revisit it in such an awkward, hackneyed way?The gratuitous deaths also bother me. If you're going to kill a character off, kill one who is critical to Harry's development. Make Harry a three dimensional character! Do something earth-shattering to him! Also--merely showing a pile of dead bodies on the floor doesn't drive the point home. Some peripheral characters were cast off, as though their deaths were intended to evoke a certain emotion--yet they were clearly not considered important enough to be given more than a page of recognition upon their demise...What does that lead the reader to feel about those characters? Also, why the hell did Harry spend such a huge swath of the book sitting in a tent like a big doofus? Why didn't Rowling use all of those pages to illustrate the maturation of Harry's skill as a wizard--to give us some details as far as Voldemort was concerned...why wasn't there more conflict there? Why am I taking all of this so damn seriously is a better question...bleh.There were some interesting bits in this book. I guess it's time for me to state it--there's better young adult fantasy out there...series that deserve just as much, if not much more recognition...as they are better written, better rendered, etc. I do think of Harry Potter with fondness, however. Perhaps it's the combination of book and film...perhaps it's because so many friends of mine adore the books...I like them for their entertainment value...These are good pleasure reads--and could have been elevated to something much more. Perhaps my expectations were too high for this one. "},

Ms. Rowling deserves to take a little time off and enjoy basking in the glow of the knowledge that she has not only written seven successful books in ten years, but created an entire world that is big enough to fit hundreds more.Anyway, about this actual book. It felt a lot longer than the rest of them did, probably because of the format change - no more Hogwarts, no more Quidditch, points gained, points lost, detentions with Snape and all that. Our Heroes were kept on the run for pretty much the entire book, so that by the time you get to the climax you think, \"Wow, did they do all that in just 500 pages? A wedding, a break-in at the Ministry, a break-in at Gringotts, a major battle in the Malfoy mansion, a brush with death at Godrick's Hollow and all that in just 500 pages? Hot damn....\"Speaking of Gringotts, that's one of the many reasons I liked this book. Rowling told us in book one that you'd have to be a fool to break into Gringotts, and most authors would require you to take it on their word. But she went and showed us, and came up with a hell of a scenario.As much fun as it was finding out that Dumbledore was just as obnoxious in his youth as most of us are was cool, it did feel a bit forced. The entire scene where Aunt Muriel lectured Doge on Dumbledore's youthful indiscretions and mysterious family goings-on should have just WARNING: EXPOSITION stamped on it in red. I'm not sure what the purpose of it was, other than to humanize Dumbledore and to give us a lead-in to the Deathly Hallows. Which I'm still of two minds about anyway. As cool as the idea was, I don't think we should have had to wait until this late in the series to find out about them. At the end of Half-Blood Prince, Harry's path is straight and sure - Horicruxes all the way - and now we have this distraction in the Hallows. Also deserving of the EXPOSITION stamp: Snape's final memories in the Pensieve and Harry's last conversation with Dumbledore.I don't know, maybe it was to give him the choice between destroying Voldemort and defeating Voldemort or something. I haven't really processed it all yet, since I did read the book at approximately Mach 4, which is not the recommended reading speed. Perhaps I'll be more comfortable with the Hallows in the re-read.And then there was the camping sequence. I get it - they're lost in more ways than one. I suspect this may have been an artifact of the one book = one year format. It was probably also meant to keep us in a sense of heightened danger, but that's pretty much where I felt the book drag.Okay, now that I'm done nit-picking...DEATH!Ms. Rowling said in an interview that this book \"isn't a bloodbath.\"Oh really? 1. Hedwig - This was Rowling saying, \"I'm not fucking around. I've just killed Harry's most faithful companion, his tether to the world in which he belongs. Imagine what else I'm planning.\" 2. Mad-Eye Mooney - A fallen warrior, just like the chapter title says. I think Mad-Eye would have been surprised to survive this battle - of all the Order of the Phoenix he seemed most in tune with the reality that they faced. 3. Dobby - This was where I got choked up, I don't mind telling you. Dobby didn't deserve a knife in the heart. Hell, he didn't deserve to die at all. Having said that, he died very well, and his death was handled with dignity. It was also another reminder from Rowling - \"See? I killed off another completely innocent character. You people have no idea what you're in for....\" 4. Wormtail - Devious bastard. Good riddance. I would have liked to have seen more of his super-hand in action, though. What was it truly capable of? 5. Crabbe - We finally hear him speak! And we find out he's been hiding his light under a bushel. Too bad it then proceeded to burn up the bushel, and the room it was in. 6. Fred - I hate being right. Dammit. 7. Snape - Ah yes, Snape. This was done well. She kept us wondering right up to the end, and it paid off. I seriously thought he was on the dark side, but that's probably because I have no faith in real human beings, much less fictional ones. Now since I'm not a fan-fictioner, or a 'shipper, I never caught on to the idea that Snape and Lily might have had any relationship prior to Hogwarts. I thought her reaction to James' hazing was simply out of compassion for her fellow human being. I had no idea. Anyway, it's good to be wrong. Knowing everything will certainly make re-reads a little more interesting.... 8. Remus and 9. Tonks - There seems to be a lot of anger out there about the way they died - off-screen and without much impact. A lot of people appear to have a lot invested in their relationship, which surprised me. I thought they were an interesting couple, and the idea of their child was very fertile ground for future storytelling, but their relationship was never a central storyline to begin with. Every step of it was happing without the reader's knowledge. It was just revealed to us through Harry. Their courtship, their wedding, their child and their death, none of it was meant to be - and I know I'm going to get snapped at for this - important. They were a nice couple, but as we've already seen, \"nice\" doesn't exempt you from dying in this book. If you want to get analytical about it, it is probable that the orphaning of young Ted Lupin was meant to provide a positive mirror to Harry's own experience: here is another child of a wizarding family whose parents were taken from him before he even knew who they were. Unlike Harry, though, Ted will have a loving, supportive extended family to look after him and see that he's brought up right. For his part, Harry will be able to redeem Sirius in that he can be the godfather that Sirius never was. So while the deaths of Remus and Tonks was regrettable, it was not wrong. 10. Colin Creevey - The grace note. One last reminder from Rowling that she plays no favorites with the supporting cast, and a reminder that being innocent and nice and likable won't be enough to save you. See Remus and Tonks. 11. Voldemort - Definitely dead, if the epilogue is to be believed. So there.That's a pretty impressive body count, not including all the nameless characters who died and the people who only got seriously maimed. And it was this willingness to be brutal to her characters that made me love Rowling all the more....Let's see, what else.... Yes, Mrs. Weasley is my hero, and hopefully we can get Sigourney Weaver to play her in the movie. And Neville finally lived up to his promise. He could have been in Harry 's place, and he finally proved that he could have been every bit the hero that Harry was. Bravo for him. And his grandmother kicks ass in every way, shape and form....I loved the callback to Sorcerer's Stone. In that book, Harry, Ron and Hermione were trying to get past Devil's Snare, which can be repelled by fire. Hermione laments that they don't have any wood, to which Ron replies, \"have you gone mad? Are you a witch or not?\" In this book, while trying to get past the Whomping Willow, Ron moans that if they only had Crookshanks with them, they could hit the secret knot and freeze the limbs. To which Hermione replies, \"Crookshanks? Are you a wizard or what?\" Bless Rowling's heart for trusting us to be paying enough attention to get that joke.I really wish we could have seen Dolores Umbridge get her comeuppance. Imagine this scene from chapter 31, The Battle of Hogwarts.... Umbridge dashed as quickly as her legs would take her through the carnage. She was nearly hit by blast after blast of green light coming from wands carelessly aimed. Her thoughts ran on one track - I have to get out of here. She turned the corner and ran into a resilient, pinkish wall. She barely had time to register what it was before Grawp clenched his fist around her. \"Release me!\" she screamed. \"I am the senior assistant to the Minister of -\" And then Grawp ate her.Ahh, the poetry. She was an evil word-that-rhymes-with-runt and deserved to be punished.Oh, also, Pansy Parkinson: \"But he's right there!\" Winner of Hogwarts' first Slowest on the Uptake Award. That was a great moment. I would have liked to have seen a few of her fellow Slytherins stand up as well, but I guess it's tough to go against your own House.The epilogue was a good idea, if rushed. There was a flood of information that needed to be processed in only a few pages, and I see no reason why she couldn't have let it out for a few more pages. It's not like we were going to get to \"Nineteen Years Later....\" and just give up because the epilogue was too long. But it serves its purpose - it lets us know that after all that we'd seen, everything eventually works out. Not right away, and not perfectly - note that after all the talk about not allowing themselves to be divided, there are still houses at Hogwarts and Slytherin is still the \"evil\" one - but all in all everything's okay.Which brings us to my final thought, at least for now: I said at the beginning that Rowling has earned herself a nice break. She's put in a lot of work and reaped massive rewards, both tangible and intangible. But I suspect that she won't be able to rest for long. There is so much Story there, just waiting to be told. The fans will certainly take a stab at it, and I wouldn't be surprised if someone's already written a threesome between Albus Potter, Scorpius Malfoy and Teddy Lupin.Anyway, that's a whole lot more than I was planning to write, and I'm pretty sure I left things out. But there it is, my thoughts on Deathly Hallows. A good end to a good series."},

All along I have considered myself a mild Harry Potter fan, but once you get to the end and Rowling wraps up all the minute details she plants from book one you cannot help but be amazed at her creativity. Building on each of the books, writing each one at a slightly higher level as the characters grow up, all the details, and lets not forget the insignificant matter of the entire world evolving to hold a joint consciousness of Harry Potter. Children's literature has boomed and for that alone I give her immense credit.We are finally rewarded with Ron and Hermione. I am finally justified in Snape being my favorite character. We get to see the emotion to McGonagall and the history of Dumbledore. And of course, we finally, after 4100 pages, get to see the face off between good and evil, see what powers truly lie in Harry, and discover how strong our own allegiance to the boy really are. Rowling satisfies both camps on Harry's fate (without having to scar the boy with a task like Snape's) and even me who cared more about Snape's destiny than Harry's. Yes the book is long and there are a few scenes in the Forest of Deans and at Bill & Fleur's that drag, but they are spaced out and there is so much else packed in to reward you for a few pages spent just as frustrated as the hero trio. Besides my favorite scene happens in that lonely forest when Harry finds the sword. But once the action winds back to Hogwarts, the book is nearly impossible to put down. The wand loyalties could have been explained better, but overall the complexity of the plot and resolution were impressive.The emotion in the book is so strong. Maybe it's that after all these years and all these books, you feel so committed to the characters, but you can't help but feel so full of emotion, and even I'll admit it cry, at the height of the story. I don't think there's an emotion you don't feel in reading this book, but the strongest one is in the end when you have to close the book and say goodbye to the chapter in your life tied up in the story. I can't read this book without feeling sad at the end that it is over.My favorite thing about book 7 is the way it ends, back at King's Cross where your view shifts from seeing Harry's adventures as a lost 11-year-old about to have a fantastic journey to a caring adult guiding a broken boy through the pain and challenges he is about to endure and conquer on this spectacular journey.

Well Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is something like this. All those years of waiting for that Epic epic finale, you get 2 paragraphs of a fight between Voldemort and Harry. I was expecting Harry would use the killing curse at least. But he didn't. The upside though is he used Cruciatus Curse on the Carrows. HAH!!!!! Ooohh I loved that part. Makes me swell with happiness.I don't mind that J.K killed awful lot of characters,(Although I'd be happy to exchange Cho Chang for Fred) I think it was needed to show that the war was indeed gruesome. Because to NOT kill a lot of characters will make DH a wizarding and early version of Breaking Dawn. Where all the characters lived to tell the tale. No, that would be too painfully idealistic. Idealism is not in any way J.K's way of writing. If Harry Potter was too perfect to the point of unreal-ism, then it wouldn't have been the best selling series of all times.I didn't like the ending so much. But the whole book was so great, still epic. Kept me on the edge of my seat. It would hurt me if I give HP less than five stars, and honestly it doesn't deserve anything less than 5 stars.

Or even close.I can't say I was necessarily disappointed by this book, nor was I pleasantly surprised. The Deathly Hallows has its fair share of weaknesses as well as strengths and in the end it's just...meh.That's it.Meh.It left no lasting impression on me. Just meh. Rowling's strengths lie with developing sympathetic characters (albeit not very interesting ones), writing entertainingly enough for the reader to suspend disbelief in spite of all those numerous holes in her world, and, of course, creating something that appeals so largely to its audience.Rowling's world is nothing particularly special, and yet, it's hard not to be a little \"awww I wish I can go to Hogwarts!\" and \"omg that's so cool!\" So yes, part of the reason why I like this series is because it appeals to my inner fangirl. You could say I enjoy these books for all the wrong reasons. I don't make much of the \"OMG AMAAAAZING PLOT\" like its die-hard fans so ardently proclaim, nor do I find much to admire in the so-called \"deep, complex, and strong\" characters. I mean, yeah, it's all right...but what makes Harry Potter special? Why is it a masterpiece? Why should I like it, see it, approach it as a classic? (Oh, I'm not kidding. We've all heard the repetitive \"Harry Potter will withstand the test of time\" crap.)Writing, in spite of its subjectivity and diversity, can also be a precise art. You can tell when authors know what they're doing and when they don't. In this case, whether Rowling finds her stride when writing or not is quite obvious to the reader; it fluctuates from time to time, some places being stronger and others being weaker and more lazily written.Many fans would say that Rowling is an excellent prose writer--at the very least, \"it's soooo much better than Twilight\" etc. etc.--but is she really?Words and language should be well placed with consistency and precision--each word should serve some kind of purpose, regardless of whether it ties into moving the plot forward--but also with style. In this case it's pretty obvious what Rowling was going for: a simplistic style that was nonetheless vibrant and lively, quick, to-the-point, and basically what she sees as the best possible style for children's stories. But as Harold Bloom so eloquently puts it, \"Rowling's mind is so governed by clichU+00E9s and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing.\"To add to that, Rowling not only overuses those clichU+00E9s and dead metaphors, but she uses them so flippantly it's very jarring and irritating to the reader. She doesn't place words with a purpose, she places them with carelessness. And that is what I would call lazy writing.You could, in fact, apply that criticism to the rest of this book. Superficially, it looks like Rowling knows exactly what she's doing. She weaves an unoriginal but complex plot, with elements threading together intricately so on the surface, it looks like a work of art. A masterpiece. Complexity is good...right?Well, no. Complexity in and of itself is not good, nor is it bad. In this case how Rowling applied it I would consider to be more than a little haphazard and...hasty. I found HP to be a bit overcomplicated in some ways. That complexity doesn't have a real justification for it, and therefore feels a little overdone and forced. On the surface, like I said, Rowling is a brilliant and creative author who knows exactly what she's doing, but scrutinizing this book, the text easily betrays her lack of confidence as a writer. She pulls plot devices out of the world on a whim so frequently it becomes extremely annoying after a while. I like characters who get out of bad situations on their own merits, not on the merits of the setting. World-building shouldn't be used as a resource for devices to move the story along, it should be used as exactly what it is: a world. It's not there for the author to be lazy, it's there to enrich the story and the reader's experience.The plot elements and devices--Horcruxes, Hallows, etc.--are so last-minute, it's hard not to imagine Rowling going on the Internet, finding out that people had guessed all her \"twists,\" and throwing in a last-minute punch in an attempt to raise more suspense, in addition to lots of red herrings nearly thrown in the reader's path with a complete lack of subtlety, but in the end it's nothing more than frazzling.Plot twists seem to exist more for shock value instead of being driven from the story. Look, it's really annoying when the author catches you at a \"Gotcha suckers!\" moment and you feel like you're being cheated. Aside from being rather belittling and insulting to my intelligence, it's ultimately very pointless. Any benefit that could be gotten out of shocking the reader and nothing more is completely short-term. Character development is just the same--uncertain, last-minute, and rushed. I'm not exactly sure how Harry and his friends develop as real people. I mean, sure, it's easy to point out how Rowling puts them through hell and beats them up at every opportunity, but horrifying experiences do not instantly constitute character development. In this book especially, there was also a loss of intimacy with the characters--the emotional distance between me as a reader and them as characters was so great that I just didn't care about them.Rowling seems to have a little trouble manipulating tone and pacing. The lead-in and buildup to the climax was so jostling and distracting I didn't even realize the climax had come until they started celebrating the defeat of Voldemort. The events building up to the climax were dragged out, while the climax itself wasn't fleshed out to be rewarding enough to compensate for all the dullness and dragging that came before it. Combined, it made for a very unbalanced story structure and haphazard book as a whole.The morality and \"life lessons that are good for children to learn\" are muddled, contrived and forced. Oftentimes I felt that Rowling was deliberately shaping her story and characters to fit the \"ideal\" book and \"strong, likable characters,\" rather than letting those merits develop naturally as the novel progressed. Doing what she did--trying to force her books to fit the mold of society's standards instead of, if she so desired, letting it happen on their own--just makes the novel look so much more fake and lazy as a result.Basically, my main complaint with this book can be boiled down to this: Rowling doesn't know what she's talking about. She seriously doesn't. Everything is so disjointed and strewn all over the place it's pretty obvious that Rowling wrote this not to write a mind-blowing amazing piece of literature, but because she was afraid to disappoint her fans. She got caught up in that fear and focused more on playing it safe, and guess what? The novel suffered because of it.As a reader, it's frustrating when you can tell the author feels incompetent. Not incompetent, but feels incompetent. Rowling doesn't seem confident as a writer, and her writing betrays that to me personally. If the author is isn't sure, then how will the reader ever be? If Rowling isn't willing to take risks, how will this installment ever be anything but just that--safe? Mediocre? Just okay? Nothing more than that?I liked this book. I truly, honestly did. But my enjoyment did not come from this book being actually amazing, it came from its subjective entertainment value. I would call this book an adequate one, not an extraordinary one."},

Wouldn't they come in handy when everyone was dying? Why not turn back the clock and warn someone about what was going to happen? After all, aI wasn't happy with my previous review, and decided to re-write it.I will round all of my dislikings of this book to three things;1. The PlotholesOh, JK Rowling. You and your plotholes. Firstly, we have the issue brought up many times by others -- the time turner. I assume Minerva McGonagall had more of those, since she was able to just give Hermione one. Wouldn't they come in handy when everyone was dying? Why not turn back the clock and warn someone about what was going to happen? After all, as shown in the fourth book time is not set in the Harry Potter world.Secondly, we have the confusion of the ending. How did Harry come back to life? Can someone explain this to me? I thought his mother's love broke when he turned seventeen. How did Voldemort die, but he lived? Why can't Volemort kill a seventeen year old boy with seemingly infinite magical knowledge? The first four books it was cute how Harry kept escaping, but then it started to get confusing. Is there another magic at work here, besides Dumbldedores love? Can we make this more clear? Sigh. Believe me, love is cool and all, but love won't solve all your problems. What about hard work and perseverance? We have a little of that, but not as much as there should be. Love is the answer to everything, I guess, but there comes a time when you need to be practical. That time is when people are dying and you know, you're seventeen and not eleven and you're a chosen one and hey, things are starting to get serious.2. Hermione Granger's Lonely Hearts ClubI really wanted to use that. Moving on,I admit, I ship her with Harry. However, that is not why I'm miffed at her ending up with Ron. From book one, Ronald Weasly has belittled her, underestimated her, called her stupid, annoying, hinted that she was ugly, ignored her, yet begged her to do his homework, and promptly not proved that he deserved her affections at all.And yet, we have book seven, they're supposed to be in love????Now, I'm not going to pretend like she hasn't been mean to him too, but let's face it -- Hermione was never a jerk towards Ron without reason. He usually always did something to provoke her first, like call her a know it all, ask her to the Yule ball at the last moment, say that she has no friends, imitate her, act as if he was above her and generally be a prat with the \"emotional range of a teaspoon\" as she so fittingly states.We are not given any reason as to why she should be in love with Ron. We are just told that she is. That bugs me.3. Why Do Donuts Have To DieMaybe that last title was a bit random. By donuts, I mean excessive amounts of minor characters.I know it isn't meant to be this way, but to me as the reader, it seems that JK Rowling killed off a lot of minor characters to sub for one major character. Since I didn't like any of the minor characters she killed off, I guess it seemed gratuitous to me. I mean, I just didn't care that much. Granted, there are casualties in war, but it seemed like she was showing this off at the end to seem badass. It didn't work. It was just annoying.BONUS TIME!4. Some Scars Can't Be SeenWhere's the emotional scarring? Everybody ends up happily married at the end, as if a horrible war hadn't taken place but twenty years earlier. They were tortured for the love of god -- some of them were even locked in a dark cellar for weeks on end! Tell me that isn't scarring. Please do.In conclusion,I gave the book one star for a reason. Despite that, there are some things I did like about it;1. Snape!2. Dean, Luna, and Oliver.3. ...Snape?4. We got a lot of Harry/Hermione bonding scenes, even if they were ignored.I'm sure there were other things, but I can't remember them/am too lazy to go into them right now.Keep in mind, I like the Harry Potter series and think JK Rowling is a pretty decent author. But this book just didn't do it for me."},

Good because I've experienced it all, bad because it's now over.I knew the plot before going in because the last movie was the freshest in my mind, so I braced myself for the deaths that were coming, revelations that jumped out to reveal themselves, and the creative wrap-up. Rowling used her imagination at top form to show the hidden natures of some of the characters we previously viewed as villains, backstories of heroes, and twists in escaping death and losing for Harry Potter himself.Since it was the last book, it was the darkest as the battle reigned supreme for Hogwarts and Harry and his friends - they finally had to face that final fight, leaving no one unscathed. My favorite part was definitely at the school when the battle was waging. McGonagall remains a favorite, I wish we knew about her story afterward. Bellatrix versus Mrs Weasley was an epic time, Neville standing up for his friends, and of course the sad, sad deaths that happened to some series regulars.Truthfully some of the down parts were a little dull at times - Harry and Hermione and Ron wandering around had some interesting scenes though, such as the snake Nagiri in the Hollows scene being so creepy it was like something written out of a horror book. The scene where Harry finds the sword was awesome as well, but it just seemed like a little magic was missing when the gang was separated so long from the school and other characters. Those characters, classes, school, hiding from teachers...all of that was a strong binding substance for the story being as great as it was. It would be nice to know more in the epilogue about what happened to some surviving characters, such as the Weasley's besides Ron and Percy, Luna and her father, and a few others. Hopefully Harry kept Kreacher around as a personal house elf for life. The resolution was sweet since it showed the future and who the main characters got together with, as well as Harry giving an important tribute to two main characters in the naming of his son, but it did feel a little off for some reason, not sure why. It almost felt a little forced. It answers marriage and kids but what about careers and other stuff? I know some wanted Harry to end up with another girl in the series, but I'm happy with how it ended. Even J.K. Rowling herself now says she wish she had done that differently, but I think she made the right decision the first time.As evil as Voldemort was, he made a memorable villain. On the other side of the coin, Harry and his friends made intelligent and worthy heroes. I'll miss the school and the stories - everything from laughing and learning, to fighting and plotting. I'll miss the characters who were killed off, and wonder what happened to those left behind. I still think it would have been more interesting had a certain professor lived and played a part in the ending.Of course this series couldn't last forever, but it's good the author wrote seven lengthy books that are impossible to forget.

IU+2019ve known it for years.U+201D U+2014 Harry PotterMost seventeen-year olds donU+2019t view the possibility of an early death as being, well, possible. But then again, most seventeen-year olds havenU+2019t come face-to-face with death almost half a dozen times before their first kiss either.In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh and final installment of the ridiculously popular Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling brilliantly ties up every loose end that she has planted over the last ten years since the very first outing of the series was published in 1997. Truly, Rowling has learned exactly what her fans want and subsequently delivers a book that answers every PotterheadU+2019s questions U+2014 and then some. Not only does Deathly Hallows revisit key places and characters from all of the previous six books, but Rowling even manages to make clever references to previous bits of dialogue from her earlier books. Case in point: near the end of the first Potter book, after Hermione fails to see the magical solution to saving the trio from a nasty patch of DevilU+2019s Snare, HarryU+2019s best mate Ron bellows U+201CHAVE YOU GONE MAD? ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?U+201D Now, six years later, Hermione finally gets her revenge on her red-headed friend when Ron believes that all is lost until Hermione yells to him U+201CAre you a wizard, or what?U+201D thus reminding Ron to use his wand to solve their problem. Subtle references such as this are a large part of what makes RowlingU+2019s books so enjoyable to re-read as there are always deeper meanings and additional allusions that are often only discovered via multiple read-throughs.HarryU+2019s bold statement regarding his own potential death is also a prime example of how much Rowling truly wrote HarryU+2019s last tale for her long-time fans. This line seems to read as a secret U+201Cshout-outU+201D to the Potterites who have also known for years that the series might not end happily ever after. The prophecy in the fifth book revealed that U+201Cneither shall live while the other survivesU+201D, and therefore by the end of book seven either Harry or Voldemort had to die. Rowling cleverly fills her last installment with so many twists, turns and complications, however, that it becomes practically impossible to determine which way this book is going to end. More than any of the other Potter books, Deathly Hallows is a true quest narrative, with the trio spending the majority of the story hunting for horcruxes and hallows whilst evading capture by VoldemortU+2019s Death Eaters. The multiple close-calls that all three main characters find themselves in throughout the book add to the tension that continues to build until the predictably bloody battle at the end of the tale. The book does, after all, chronicle a brutal war, so be prepared for a lot of killing and, consequently, a lot of tears. This is not to say that Deathly Hallows doesnU+2019t offer up a great deal of laughs as well. The hilarious twins Fred and George Weasley make several appearances to ensure that the book isnU+2019t all doom and gloom. By far, the funniest part of the story is the secret radio show Potterwatch, anonymously hosted by former Hogwarts Quidditch commentator Lee Jordan with special appearances from Fred, George, and ex-Defence Against the Dark Arts professor Remus Lupin. Rowling perfectly mixes this blend of humour, tragedy and adventure so that her epic-length novel never lags or drags.To write a 607 page book that millions of die-hard fans around the world are able to devour in less than 24 hours is no mean feat, but RowlingU+2019s farewell to the Boy Who Lived is an incredibly gripping page-turner that will leave all Potter lovers immensely satisfied."},

This will contain spoilers (though since I'm writing this a year after the release I don't think it's too much of a tragedy), it will be long and it will be negative because I really didn't like this book.Reading books one to five I was very impressed with the storytelling from a novice novellist. There was magic, there were characters you could love, and sure there were some cliche'd storylines, but they were interspersed with really interesting sidestories (Peeves, SPEW, Weasley's Wizard Wheezes). I was enthralled as a teenager and I am enthralled now as an adult when I re-read them.But I have to say the the quality dropped markedly in books six and seven. The ramblings (that started out cute in GoF and OotP) have become pronounced and boring. The characters have lost much of what made them endearing, and the plot has gone to hell.Focusing on Deathly Hallows, I had a very strong feeling that six months before her deadline, JKR went on to the internet, discovered that everyone had guessed her 'twists' (honestly, who didn't know that Harry was an accidental Horcrux, RAB was Sirius's brother, the diadem was at Hogwarts, the locket was at Grimmauld Place, Dumbledore ordered Snape to kill him, Snape was in love with Lily and Ron would be a it and abandon Harry and Hermione?), and felt the need to come up with a new plot device. This would explain the incredible stupidity that is the deathly hallows and the plot holes and gaps in logic that involve them.Now, it has been a while since I read it so some of my names and such might be wrong, and if it does answer the questions in the book in such a round about way I apologise, but the Elder Wand does not make sense. I'm willing to accept that it follows it's own set of rules separate from those of other wands (where Haary can use Hermione's wand almost as well as his own and all of the disarming they did in book five didn't make their wands all change ownerships) but the course of events whereby Harry became the owner of the wand are just plain silly. If Grindelwald simply stole the wand from Gregorovich (sp?), how did that make him the wands owner? If the wand is unbeatable, how did Dumbledore defeat Grindelwald (I know Rita Skeeter theorised that Grindelwald surrended, but how does that pass the wand's ownership to Dumbledore. Surrender is not the same as defeat). And if the wand is unbeatable, why was Dumbledore unable to defeat Voldemort when they dueled on OotP? And also, is Harry really so conceited and stupid to think that no one would ever defeat or disarm him, making them the owner of the wand? Shouldn't he have broken it? If he does become an auror in later life someone is bound to disarm him eventually, and if they knew about the wand, they could easily steal it back from Dumbledore's tomb.The other major thing that ticked me off was the characterisation. Hermione, Harry and Ron have always been some of my favourite characters, but here they are acting completely different from previous books. Harry using Unforgivable curses without a hint of remorse, and not comforting Hermione when Ron takes off, instead staring at a 'Ginny-dot'. Can we say creepy and stalkerish? And Hermione, who for the most part was still loyal and brave and smart (loved the bottomless bag bit, and her being there for Harry at Godric's Hollow), was so pathetic when it came to Ron. I know love makes people do the wacky, but crying for days on end when they're supposed to be searching for Horcruxes, kissing him in the middle of the war because he finally showed a tiny inkling of care towards the house-elves. And Ron. Gah! I mean, I love Ron, but you would have thought he could have grown up a little, just a smidgen. But no, running away because of the locket (one ring to rule them all...). Those who defend him saying it affected him more than Harry or Hermione because he had more insecurities is just dumb. Harry and Hermione had just as much to be insecure about. Harry, with his saving-people-thing, could easily have gone nuts with the locket around his neck and ran away from the others because he was terrified that they'd get killed. And Hermione has always been insecure, about being Muggle-born, about proving herself, about Ron and Harry and their friendships. Sure, he wanted to come back the moment he left, but he still left. Which I could accept were it not for such a stupid reason. And then he got his 'super-moment' which was so lame. Honestly, 'Ron can remember and copy paseltongue', uhuh. Wouldn't it have made much more sense to say, have Ginny come along, who could possibly still say the word from when she opened it under Tom's control in CoS. And then Ron mentioned the house-elves, to make himself 'worthy' (JKR's words, not mine) of Hermione. For one thing, why does he need to make himself 'worthy' since she already loved him for all his insensitivity and insecurity, and why did that 'worthiness' have to be something that Harry already had in abounds?Yes, I am a H/Hr shipper, but that is by no means the reason I hated this book (as you can see from above). If H/Hr had been handled as badly as R/Hr or H/G, I would have hated it. But the fact remains that the most romantic scenes in this book were between Harry and Hermione. At Grimmauld Place when Harry showed Hermione the picture, at the wedding where Hermione beamed at Harry, at Godric's Hollow where they strolled arm in arm under the kissing gate in the snow. While in canon, Harry married Ginny and Ron married Hermione, that will never convince me that they are the better couples. Harry and Hermione had the friendship, the trust, the alchemy. They were the most developed relationship in the series, and the fact that they didn't end up together in the book doesn't change that.The final things I feel like picking on - the epilogue came across as being written by a teenage fangirl. No depth, no meaning, just stupid-named kids. I get that JKR wanted Harry to end the book with the normal family life he never had, it could have been handled so much better. And seriously, Albus Severus? That poor kid must have been teased horribly. And why Severus? Sure, he turned out to be not evil, but for Harry to chance his mind about the man after seven years of abuse and ill treatment just because he was scamming on Lily. It's just gross. And unrealistic. I was so hoping there was more to Snape's story than twenty years of unrequited love. Gah. It may have been a sweet way for him to become not evil, but Lily was very, very dead for a very long time, and no one holds on that hard to love. If caring for her wasn't enough for him to stray away from the dark arts while she was alive, why was it enough when she was dead?Also, the invisibility cloak was supposed to be infallible, and yet Moody saw through it in OotP and Dementor's could see through it in PoA, supposedly. And, my god did the death scene's suck in this book. Yes, its a war so plenty of people, including main characters were going to die, but when I felt worse about Dobby than I did about Remus (who is one of my favourite characters) you just know that the author hasn't put enough emotion into it. He was the last of the Marauders, for god's sake, he deserved an on-page death at the very least. Maybe defending Harry or Tonks. Something!Well, there ends the rant. There were a few good points in the novel (like Godric's Hollow, before the stupidity of Harry not realising that Bathilda was Nagini, and the awesomeness of Neville) but they were few and far between and do not at all make up for the rest of the drivel.Read it because it is the conclusion to a series that took seventeen years to write, but do not expect the fireworks that such a finale could have been. There's better fanfics out there."},

It is not an in-depth analysis of the work in general, nor is it a review on any one particular installment.Harry Potter is a work of art. I got made fun of onceU+00B9 when I was out to dinner with some friends, because while we were discussing these books I made the mistake of referring to them as U+201Cliterature.U+201D I felt like I had to defend that assertion because, although the definition of literature is pretty broad, it seems like it should really only apply to works with some definable qualitative value or literary merit. In this case, my friends were wrongU+2014Rowling explores themes and concepts in this series that I think are valuable to children and young adults who look to her characters for qualities they seek to emulate, and I believe her works will have lasting impact on this and future generations.IU+2019ve heard it said before that everything you need to know youU+2019ve learned in kindergarten. Well, that might be somewhat of an oversimplification, but I do think children or young adults who grow into this series, seeing Harry and his friends mature as they themselves mature, can glean some pretty important life lessons from it. They are impressionable human beings who are learning about themselves and are starting to make the choices that reflect the kinds of people they want to be.So what does Harry Potter teach them? Well, here is a bullet list of what it has taught me. And if youU+2019re good, IU+2019ll think about turning this into a PowerPoint presentation. Or maybe not.U+2022 The quality of your character is not a reflection of where you come from or who your parents are; rather, it is a reflection of the choices you make, so make them wisely.U+2022 The way you treat other people, especially those less fortunate than you, reveals your true colors more quickly and more completely than almost anything else you do.U+2022 It is a good thing to have dreams and ambitions, but that alone is not enough. You cannot expect success without effort.U+2022 It is far less important what your abilities are than what you actually do with them. Your abilities alone do not define you.U+2022 Nobody likes to fail, but to refuse an attempt at success on the grounds that youU+2019re afraid to fail is failure in itself.Growing up is about figuring out who you are and coming to terms with your strengths and weaknesses, and it is about deciding how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses in order to become a better person. ItU+2019s a lifelong struggle, but it starts early, and I think Harry Potter offers the tools to help achieve that. It can help young people find their way, and maybe thatU+2019s an oversimplification for a seven-volume series of novels, but thatU+2019s what I got out of it, and thatU+2019s why I will recommend this to my kids as they start to become ready for some life lessons of their own.U+00B9This is misleading; IU+2019ve been made fun of countless, countless times."},

I felt how it's different than the movie,The characters more alive ,forcing you to feel that they're your friends, like you're already living with them in the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry,it was like my other HomeI finished the series in Arabic and start it in English 2 years ago,It was still fresh and as thrilling, emotional ,great as ever.Here I'll try to stick to review that part of the series only ,till I write more about the experince of living The Harry Potter SagaThe Plot********Remember before book 7 release how were we been feeling?**Harry still got 4 Horcruxes to find -and even to know what it'll be- and even how to destroy it.**And then Fight the 7th Part of the shuttered soul...Voldemort himself, his Death Eaters and the traitor Snape. **How he can do all that without Dumbledore , Black and all of those he can't tell about his quest as Dumbledore ask him to not tell but to Ron and Hermione.We all thought it will be difficult to fit it all in one last volume ,and to wrap up characters and events. But the amazing plot of that book didn't only fit for that all. and also add a new element \"The Deathly Hallows\" and fit it perfectly into the full story.. I can't believe how that book fit everything we're all been asking about since the very early beginning ,and some of the facts that anyone wondered about like How the trace dedicate the underage magic, Why we can't just create food from thin air, or why there was a Taboo on saying \"Voldemort\"'s name..and so more.It dive deeply into the past of important characters we thought we know enough , Dumbledore and Snape.From the beginning you see a wrapping up for the characters,the places -like Private Drive- and the events.. you'll see a lines that connected to the very early of the series and book one..you'll be in a journey toward the ending without feeling disconnected from the whole previous events and characters.There's no something you'll feel-if u pay enough attention - out of place ,out of the plot or out of the characters .The Characters **************Was so glad that J.K.Rowling announce that there's no \"new\" character presented in the last books which was perfect since it's the end of the series and it's better to focus on our beloved characters and the ones we lived wit them for years.The characters deals here with the \"real responsibilities\" that comes with the coming of age. or the quest they asked for and they have to do for their good and greater goodThere were no any \"Exaggeration\" or over acting, the characters go normally ,naturally and very real, The writer chose to describe even the smallest feelings they feel in some important situations like for example Harry's final visit to the Dark Forest, or the boredom of the days on the run from place to place.And won't forget the wrapping up of Every character sometimes with surprises which is never out of character.She was always have it all planned and well drawn The Message ***********I have to admit at my second reading I find an extraordinary spiritual amazing messageIt starts with the 2 quotations one is pagan, and one is from a Christian tradition.. one about the Death and one about Friends..and it fit perfectly to the theme of the book,and the message of Love that can beat any other force.I saw also a symbol in the Dumbledore's character and the whole Harry -Dumbledore's relation, complicated symbol of Faith, religion and religious people. in many ways that you have to look carefully to dedicate it.U+0650 U+0650And look at the final fight between Harry and Voldemort ..I was like..My God you're the best writer EVERU+201CYouU+2019re right. But before you try to kill me, IU+2019d advise you to think about what youU+2019ve done. . . .

Try for some remorse. . . .U+201D  It's not just normal fight between Good and Evil , It's amazing written novel.Can't seriously describe all of what I want to say about this series Just one thing I can admit,It's my wonderful journey, It's my friends, It's the books that made me- trying to be- a better person. It's where I meet my friends.. It's where I truly Laugh while reading/living the story..It's where I cry with characters and feel sorry for some. It's magic..It's real magic cause It's words of LoveSo glad to finish it at 2nd May, And so strange I didn't feel I'm going to miss the Harry Potter books although I finished it before in Arabic, and that was the ending of my experience with it in English, But deep inside me is sure I'll go back to Hogwarts again ,re-reading from one to seven soon ISA.Before I finish I have to share this great man's word..Who really was the best transforming a paper character to a real life Thank you Joanna Rowling.

I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, and theme parks.Being that it came out nearly a decade ago, I think it holds up pretty well."},

I'm also really angry because I'm giving it 5-stars because it's so freaking clever. But I've got complaints. But HECK. Life is short. Eat dessert first. Give books 5-stars. But I feel emotionally manipulated by this sneaky paperback, DARN YOU HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS. MY LOVE FOR YOU IS COMPLICATED.First: let's talk about why Cait is a Grumpy Gills:U+2022 The fact that the pacing is rubbish. Sorry?! But it kind of is. The beginning borderlines B.O.R.I.N.G. Not enough that I wasn't interested? But enough that I was annoyed. It felt like JK Rowling didn't know what to do with her characters if they didn't have Hogwarts classes to get to.U+2022 I'm annoyed that the Slytherins were still labelled at the end as \"badies\". C'mon. Honestly?! Especially in that epilogue when (view spoiler)[Ron (hide spoiler)] says \"don't make friends with Slytherins, kids!\" I mean. Rubbish and growls. (I am a defensive Slytherin, FYI.)U+2022 And speaking of Slytherin's...I kind of thought Harry and Draco might've (view spoiler)[made up or something?? Been tentative friends????? BUT NO??!?! (hide spoiler)] Apparently all the stuff I'd gleaned from the internet is wishful thinking. Heh.U+2022 There was VERY cliche Voldemort-must-monologue-before-his-kill scene.U+2022 To be realistic...Harry should've passed out from FOOD DEPRIVATION. Why is not one angry about this?!? The lad barely EVER ATE. I was hungry reading this blasted book. Someone give the kid a scone before he kills a thing.U+2022 I'm annoyed Luna and Neville didn't get more page time. REALLY annoyed.U+2022 I still don't ship the ships. In bk6 I was totally onboard with Harry and Ginny. But now? Meh. They like have no chemistry, sorry. And Hermione and Ron? LET. ME. LAUGH. No. Still...no. Though Ron did mature a lot in this book and I am proud. ...okay. My wrath is out. Now time for the FEEEEEEELS. Don't say I didn't warn you.EVERYTHING I FREAKING LOVED AND THE REASONS THIS BOOK IS GETTING 5 FREAKING STARS OMG FEELELLELELELELS:U+2022 My darling baby Neville Longbottom. No joke. I HAD A DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT. (I have not seen any movies, btw.) But my motorbike had broken down and he came and fixed it for me and it was adorable and my heart melted. I want a Neville Longbottom, please and thank you. MY CRUSH. U+2022 The plot is clever. Okay seriously IT IS CLEVER. I loved how things tied in and tied up and I loved all the \"reveals\" and it was just clever.U+2022 And the world building is my favourite as always. I want to live a Hogwarts. BUT DOESN'T EVERYBODY?U+2022 Professor MacGonagall. Because she gives life. She is everything. All my love for Professor MacGonagall and her terrific dialogue lines, okay?U+201COur Headmaster is taking a short break,\" said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snape-shaped hole in the window.U+2022 I love Harry. I really do. Like at the end there, he was almost a little too perfect, which was boderline irritating? But he is a precious little piece of pumpkin juice and I LOVE how he makes mistakes and sometimes needs slapping with a broomstick, but at the end of the day he's just a GOOD KID. Likey.U+2022 Obviously Hermione. U+2022 I hate hate hate hatttttte when the word \"bitch\" is used in a derogatory way towards women. But. There was this scene with Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange = and I liked it. YOU KNOW THE ONE, FOLKS.U+2022 Snape. Omg. Snape. I do agree that his a very complex character and I LIKE that. But I still hate him. Why? Because he could've done EVERYTHING just how he needed too -- sans bully children. I get why he hated Harry. I would've hated Harry if James had been like that (question: why the hell did Lily marry James?!??! Seriously?! HE SUCKED) but Neville?! Why did Snape pick on Neville so bad? He literally traumatised my darling baby and I shall not forgive him. I do not \"like\" Snape but I like the complexity of his story. And I kind of wish there as a book about Snape. His backstory seemed too rushed.U+2022 THE DEATHS.  Okay that sounds marginally sadistic. But hear me out. I hate when big battle finales keep all the \"favourites\" alive. It's dumb and unrealistic. There need to be deaths, and I think HPatDH did it really well. I got all tied up in knots several times. SNIFFLES. U+2022 I love Luna. She is an amazing special creature and I wish she was in the books more.U+2022 Speaking of which...I have to admire how ALL the characters are just so epic. I would seriously read spin-off series on anyone of them. THAT takes skill to write even secondary characters so the reader is invested.U+2022 I LIKED IT EVEN THOUGH IT KINDA MANGLED FEELS AND IT FRUSTRATED ME. But it surprised me! When I thought I'd seen all the spoilers of ever. And I was emotionally invested. Omg. I WAS.U+2022 (No tears though. I am a Vulcan.)*** ABOUT THAT EPILOGUE ***Okay but, spoilers about the finale below. (view spoiler)[I am twitchy about the finale. I thought there'd be more. All we know is who married who and how many kids they had and what STUPID names they gave their children. And Harry's son James is basically Harry's father reincarnated. Does that not disturb anyone? *raises hand*But what did Harry and Ginny do? Like did they get a Killed Voldemort Pesnion and get to retire? Did Harry become an Auror? Why the HECK didn't he get to teach in school? I think he'd been an awesome Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.Did Lunar and Neville marry?Or did Neville save himself for me?What did George do, sans Fred? Like, could George exist without a Fred?Why did Hermione settle so low when she married Ron?What happened to Kreecher? I want to hug Kreecher. I also want him to bring me a sandwich too.Did Professor MacGonagall stay in school to teach or did she scream when she saw Harry's children and say \"I QUIT\"?....I am kind of angry there are no answers to these. Let me huff. (hide spoiler)]Aaaaand...I'M DONE. What else do I say? Yes. I loved it. YES. I love this series. I had a rocky start, and I thought it was dumb. But seriously? If I'd been reading this as a kid. I would been obsessed. OBSESSED. As is, I really want to own the books just for the sake of it because they're good and they're amazing and they deserve the world-wide cult fandom. It's a satisfying and grand and perfectly wretched finale and I should like to cheer enthusiastically.Omg, look at me. I'm a little HP fangirl. IT'S OVER FOR ME. I'VE REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN. U+201COf course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?U+201D(Also that quote means so much to me I cannot even.)[Ron (hide spoiler)][made up or something?? Been tentative friends????? BUT NO??!?! (hide spoiler)][I am twitchy about the finale. I thought there'd be more.

He accepts that he must die and understands that there are far worse things in the living world than dying.U+201D  -Albus Dumbledore  To you, yes you, reader of this review, should you decide to read this review from beginning up to the very end, I offer you my deep thanks for your resilience, bravery and loyalty for this may be one of the longest reviews youU+2019ll ever read on Goodreads. You still have time to back out though, so donU+2019t tell me you havenU+2019t been warned.^^  To J.K. Rowling, there is no argument about your brilliance. You are a certified genius, a person with superhuman writing ability and imagination and I canU+2019t praise you enough for writing these books that have forever changed my life. But youU+2019re still human and surely youU+2019ve recognized your flaws. One of which is your penchant for killing your characters. You canU+2019t blame me for thinking that one of the reasons you created so many great and memorable characters is for you to be able to kill as many of them as you want to. I accept though with the heaviest heart that certain characters needed to die, needed to sacrifice their lives for the greater good but I find no good reason for the death of (view spoiler)[Fred! (hide spoiler)]. Why? Why kill him? HavenU+2019t you killed enough already? Why did he even have to die?! Why not Percy instead? (kidding). I honestly think no Weasley should have died for obvious reasons I donU+2019t think I still have to enumerate. Also, I honestly believe the last book lacks at least 200 more pages. Why jump to 19 years later epilogue right after the devastating war? DonU+2019t the rest of the other characters deserve a few pages about them? A simple tribute perhaps to all their sacrifice and pain and loss? I have gone so far, have read hundreds and hundreds of pages from book one only to be spared of better resolutions before an epilogue. Also, donU+2019t you think (view spoiler)[Professor Severus Snape (hide spoiler)] deserved a better, more respectful way to die? And whatever happened to (view spoiler)[Professor MoodyU+2019s (hide spoiler)]body? So you see, even though I admire you with 99.72 percent of my heart, .28 percent percent is resenting your choices. But thank you. Now my heart is tougher and braver. Characters in the next books I read could all die and I probably wouldnU+2019t shed a tear. I just wish I read your books before Allegiant and Mockingjay. I probably would have considered those happy endings.  To Harry Potter, I will never forget your brave and pure heart. You showed me that heroes can be an average boy with no special superpowers except courage, trustworthy instincts and strength of will, oh and of course, a bunch of awesome wizards and witches supporting and protecting him the best way they can.   To Hermione Granger , you are the most kick-ass heroine IU+2019ve ever met without needing to actually kick ass. You only needed your intellect, level headedness and kind heart and like Ron said, without you and your beaded bag, he and Harry would not have survived a day during your quest.  To Ron Weasley, you probably are the biggest idiot in the story but you showed the best of you in times you are needed the most. I admire your loyalty, sarcasm and free spirit and there is no better man for Hermione than you.   To Fred and George, when in tears, I could always count on you guys for a good laugh. It's no fun without you. (view spoiler)[George, itU+2019s hard enough losing a part of your body but to have to lose your twin brother too. Oh Gaaaaawd! *wails*  (hide spoiler)]  To Hagrid (and Graupy) , *hugs* IU+2019ll never forget your gallons of tears and rock cakes! Thank you for your loyalty, friendship and bravery. You will be remembered for generations.   To Professor Snape,you are indeed the bravest of them all. Your sacrifice is utterly self-less and certainly the biggest of all. Your memories Harry and I saw in DumbledoreU+2019s Pensieve ripped my heart to pieces and I spent days and nights crying for you. You're a true hero and you deserve a monument. Maybe I'll name my son after you. *wails*  To Professor Dumbledore, you are the true epitome of sacrifice, love and humility. You find something good in every person and you never fail to offer kindness even to those others deem undeserving.  To DumbledoreU+2019s Army led by Neville, Luna, Ginny,, you guys are awesome!  To the Order of the Phoenix, you were amazing especially you Mrs. Weasley! IU+2019m so sorry for your losses but thank you, thank you so much.  To the Hogwarts Professors led by Prof. Mc Gonagall, you did an amazing job holding off Voldy! You were all brilliant!  To the Malfoys,uh I donU+2019t know. How about I just stick my tongue out at the lot of you!  To Dobby,  *wails* I canU+2019tU+2026just thank you so much. YouU+2019re the most loyal elf. The bravest free elf I know.  To Kreacher, you poor thing. I had no idea what you had to go through and what made you the way you are. In the end, thank you for your bravery and for leading the elves to the battle.  To the Death Eaters and Snatchers led by Bellatrix and Greyback, I have two words foryou. U+201CAVEDA KEDAVRA!U+201D  To Umbridge, off to Azkaban, you go!   To Voldemort, thatU+2019s right, I dare! I am completely with Harry, You donU+2019t learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?  To the rest of the fallen, (view spoiler)[Professor Moody, Cedrick, Sirius, Remus, Tonks, James and Lily, Colleen Creevey and many others (hide spoiler)], like Neville said, your death was not in vain. Thank you! *wails*  To the movie makers and actors, thank you for bringing to life the characters we love. We will always look up to you people. Don't you dare disappoint us!^^  To my Goodreads friends who bullied me into reading Harry Potter, thank you for destroying my life! I was doing perfectly fine without these books. You wrecked me pretty bad especially when I was reading the last book. I felt like hundreds of Dementors were surrounding me while reading it that I had to constantly cast a Patronus Charm while reading. It was really exhausting. My Patronus is a baby elephant, btw! Oh and I'm House Gryffindor, hurray! I'm afraid, I'm becoming worse than Luna Lovegood.  To Jia and Kyra, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, my young, smart and beautiful friends (March 06 is their actual birthday). You are both gifted for having such passion for reading at such young ages. Savor that gift and seize your most special day! [Fred!

I fell in love with the awkward, grew-up-in-his-brother's-shadows Ron... and most of all? I fell in love with the snarky, unplatable, snarling, rude, hygienically-disinclined professor of potions, Severus Snape.Almost ten years later, I'm still obsessed with it in many ways. This is the Seventh Book. This is the end of Harry Potter. I cried, I wept, I laughed, sometimes quite hysterically. And overall? I loved it. I loved Ron's humour, Harry's angst, Hermione's smarts, Snape's devotion, Dumbledore's love, Percy's return, Dobby's sacrifice, the change of Kreacher, absolutely everything. I kept waiting and waiting to be disappointed and yes, I was disappointed on the occasion, but the thrill far outweighed the flaws. As for Snape? One of the characters I fell absolutely in love with? THIS IS A HUGE SPOILER.Snape..................Snape dies. He dies working for Dumbledore. He dies, looking into Harry's eyes. He dies because for the last thirty years of his life, he has loved Lily Evans and everything he has done and everything he sacrificed was for her. His death provoked a number of emotions in me and one of the major ones was utter, utter grief. He's been abused and used his whole life, whether by his parents, by his classmates, by Voldemort, by Dumbledore, and I felt such freaking anger that in the end, he wasn't even given the proper funeral that he totally deserved. In the book itself, it made sense, because whatever Snape did for the Greater Good, he was still a bastard. But as a reader, my heart broke into ittybitty pieces over him. There were tons of other things going on at the same time. I say, Rowling is an excellent action scene writer. I'm terrible at writing action that's vivid and engaging, but she managed to do it. Harry himself lives. But he's been forever scarred by his experience. And that, actually, is one of the best parts of his book. He was such an arse in books 5 and 6, and to have this mature young man emerge was one of the greatest joys in this series. I was so, so, so happy that he got the happiness he wanted. The ending was much WTF? for me, since it was like a SOOPER HAPPILY EVER AFTER ending, but at the same time... Harry is finally happy and that means a great deal to me. Well. Harry, I've been a fan for almost ten years and in those ten years, you've made me laugh, cry, scream, whoop, run around, obsess, tender, hard, awesome and about a million other things. I've watched you grow from a scared, unsure first year into a hopeful young man in the third and fourth, an angsty teen in the fifth and sixth, and in the seventh? You came full circle and you were as your parents were. Happy, with children of your own. You changed so much and it felt like I had grown up partly with you, though I was but fourteen years old when I read you. I love all of the characters, I love all the books, and well? R.I.P. Severus Snape. You'll be missed. Same with you, Fred, Dobby, Lupin, Tonks, Moody, Colin, Scrimgoeur, Bellatrix, Peter, yes, even Voldemort. A lifetime has passed and HP is going to be one of those books that'll stay with me forever. So... peace out, Harry! You deserve out!"},

Was this book splendid because we knew all the characters and cared about them like they were real?  Yes.  Was this book so great because it made you laugh, cry, gasp, emote out loud?  Yes.  That was one of my favorite things about the book.  Regardless of where I was, whether it be sitting on the couch next to my roommate, alone in my room, or standing in my shop, I found myself cheering and gasping and all other sorts of reactions, I was just that into the story.The most emotional part for me, one of them at least, was when Dobby died.  I don't know what it was about that, but I was sobbing and had tears streaming down my face.  When they describe putting the socks on his feet, that was the part that opened the floodgates.  I am one of those people that supports the theory that socks are a very imporant symbol in the Harry Potter series.  I even did a report in one of my high school English classes on it.  \"Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped off his shoes and socks, which he placed upon the elf's bare feet.  Dean produced a woolen hat, which Harry placed carefully upon Dobby's head, muffling his batlike ears.\"  Rowling, master of subtle detail, still includes that brief mention of socks.  It was that which really did me in.Another thing that impressed me was how well the story flowed.  Probably a combination of being a good writer and knowing, without a doubt, where the story was going and what she wanted to have happen allowed Rowling to keep the story smooth and not jerky.  So easily, especially in the beginning/middle chapters in Harry, Ron, and Hermione's search for Horcruxes things could have become so choppy.  And while time did pass quickly in brief sections it still flowed.  A lot of writers, even good writers, can't seem to make something like that work, yet Rowling did, proving herself yet again.I was also really impressed by her ballsy moves of killing off several main characters, especially right in the beginning.  I thought it was going to be in the big final battle ('cause c'mon, you knew it was coming) that we lost all our favorites, not within the first few chapters.  RIP Hedwig and Mad-Eye.  That was one major way you got sucked in because you're thinking, \"Oh my God!  Characters I love are already dying!  What the-\" and then you keep going because you need to know if anyone else is going to kick it.  For some reason though Rowling just loves killing off my favorite characters, Dumbledore, Moody, Fred (and George too in a way), Lupin, Tonks.  I was especially angry over the Lupin/Tonks death.  It felt like a sort of snub because, yay they're married!  Yay, they're having a baby!  Yay, he's a little metamorphmagus.  Boo, both parents are suddenly dead.  Rude.  But I guess it made the whole thing hurt a lot more, and it did.Honestly, I felt Rowling tied things up beautifully and not in that harried, \"Oh yeah about that?  Um... this happens!  Yeah, that's it!\"  I think many fans feel vindicated (i.e. the Snape/Lily shippers, those who thought Harry was a Horcrux, don't mess with Mrs. Weasley) after reading this book.  Of course there are probably some who are broken down and upset that what they thought was going to happen didn't.  In the end we all got one hell of a story and went on one fantastic adventure.  No matter what happened, no matter who died or who ended up with who this book was more than I could have hoped for, I was not disappointed at all.All I can say now is: Jo, thank you."},

Love conquers all, and without delving too much into spoilers, that is where I will leave this. Please pick up this series if you have not, I promise it will not disappoint.This next portion is a little bit into my history with Harry Potter, to better understand how I come up with my thoughts about this series. The first time I read the Harry Potter series I was 13 years old. Now, that may seem a bit older than most when they started reading this miraculous series, but I was skeptical to the power that these books had on so many. Although I was older than most when I first read this series, I was also still pretty young and could really only relate to Harry and the others up to about the third book, Prisoner of Azkaban, when they were 13, like I was. Now, exactly five years later, I have been every age (other than in '19 Years Later'), that Harry, Hermione, and Ron have been throughout the entire series, which I think benefits me greatly in understanding their thoughts, feelings, and decisions in each book. When I first read the books, I knew that I could never love anything more, and now, five years later, I am even more sure that this series will not only stay with me forever, bring me light in my darkest days, and be passed on to my children, but also that I have not felt this way about anything. It might seem silly, but I think when one finds this in something, they know, whether or not others will understand. I will most certainly be rereading this series in the future many more times and will continue to be astounded with the growth that I see in myself as I get older, but also with this series, because as I change, it changes with me. It would be a dishonour to give this anything less than 5 stars! Infinity out of 5!"},

However the lack of supporting characters (that you might find at Hogwarts) means that this book is darker and the lack of humour makes for a depressing hundred pages around pg200.The deaths... a little weird how the human deaths are less effective, maybe that's just me but Hedwig and Dobby's deaths broke my heart. With mad-eye... well, he was an asshole so i didn't care. With Fred... well, there is another one so the impact is lessened. With Lupintonks... well if they were stupid enough to name Harry godfather (even THEY should have seen the parellalism!) then they deserve to die. No i don't mean that, but as we didn't see them die it seems less horrifying.So much more interesting and original than the others this daring new direction led to some bad writing which didn't go anywhere in the end (wtf was the hallows about?).The Hallows was a ridiculous idea and frankly i was horrified that Rowling was attempting to introduce such a 'major' theme in the last book with only one brief reference in book six. They were pointless, in the end what did it matter who had ownership of the elder wand? no one used it in 'the final duel' anyway.I no longer like Dumbledore, JK dragged him through the mud and didn't thoroughly wash him off. Harry forgave him but i sure as hell didn't (and who didn't see the 'Harry is a Horcrux' thing coming?The chapter 'King's cross' made me cry. But not because it was well written, rather the opposite, it didn't make sense at times (where the hell were they?) i had to reread the section on harry's 'phoenixlike' ability several times and i still hate it. It was so weak. This sequence was nothing like the other 'endofbookharryanddumbledore' explanations we have come to know and love. Nothing was explained in this chapter everything was re-explained and slightly embellished. The chapters immediately preceding this were the real treat of the book, Snape is finally redeemed (although after ten years of waiting i did expect a better ironclad reason for trusting him than loving lily). Harry facing his mortality is heartbreaking even though most of us have imagined it countless times. The moment right before his death is about as perfect an HP moment there is. He should have stayed dead and the narration flick to another.Voldemort's Invincible Army is defeated too easily and Bellatrix's death is unsatisfying as Molly has no real motive for revenge (nono Fred's death doesn't count). Harry should have done it. He also should have performed at least one killing curse in the book, he performed the other unforgivables, so why not?Voldemort is killed by a reflecting spell.What?WHAT?Are you KIDDING me?Could it possibly be more anticlimactic?What was the point of the elder wand then? Why the elaborate buildup when Harry doesn't even perform the execution?Anyone could have duelled to a reflection, and since when can that happen?A true HP fan must take alot on faith to enjoy this ending.The less said about the epilogue the better. Probably been written since book one and it shows. There is no depth, any hp fan could guess (or assume) this ending, its not even worth reading. Albus Severus was the only icing on this unsatisfying and dry cake.If you do read this book close it at the end of 'the forest again' and write your own ending.OR wait for JK to realise her mistake and re publish with an alternate ending.This was not a rant.Update: Look.

Rowling is not at all shy about killing her characters, especially good ones. George R.R. Martin often gets all the slack for doing thisbut despite Harry Potter's author saying that she feels bad about killing good people, a great number of them died in the series (and outside it if you start counting from Harry's parents). Some of these deaths are still as tragic on the second time around. Harry's gradual discovery of Dumbledore as not-quite-good-guy is brilliant. It took me two reads to grasp all the nuances of this. Now for the bad parts which unfortunately made me reduce otherwise perfect rating by one star. Ron - to use his favorite word - is a git, especially in this book. He was destined to remain forever in Harry's shadow, but this is exactly the place he deserved. He did not do anything exciting on his own since fated chess match in the first (!) book. As a character Ginny Weasley cannot be even compared to Luna Lovegood, not to mention Hermione Granger. If Harry could not get Hermione, I hoped he ended up with Luna - sure she is loony at times, but she is always understanding, brave, and smart; read carefully her parts if you do not believe me. She was able to help Harry more than Ginny whose only help was kissing him a couple of times. The forest sequence of the book was way too long. This is probably the only part of the series which felt drown out. The whole epilogue feels off. I understand the need to show happily ever afterbut it still feels out of place. So as I mentioned with these complaints I have to reduce the rating by one, reluctantly. The whole series however deserved unconditional perfect rating. If you have not read it because you think this is for children or because it is too mainstream, or because you think it offends your religious beliefs - get off your high horseand head to your nearest library for the magical experience.

I find I get a bit muddled from watching the films, too, in that after watching them I can't remember if bits were in the book or the film and vice versa. Oh well. Really must stop over-thinking things! [Scroll down for my first review, from 2007.]The final Harry Potter book always looks too short to me, like, how could everything possibly be wrapped up in a book that's not as long as The Order of the Phoenix, when there's still so much to do?! I felt that the first time, and I felt that again. But once again I admire Rowling's skill in crafting a tremendous story and a powerful ending for what is to me one of the best fantasy series out there. There's a lot going on in this novel, but it's nicely balanced with quieter, slower parts and you really get that last chance to really know Harry, Ron and Hermione. Rowling never lets plot overpower her characters or her story, and she won't be rushed: the pacing is steady and consistent throughout, which only adds to the tension-filled scenes where you start biting your nails.This is a book that makes me cry, and I'll tell you why - in a bit. I wondered how I could share all the things I love about this particular book, and figured listing them was probably the best option.  Hedwig dying. I had completely forgotten, and it's so, so sad. I like how they did it for the movie, giving her a role and using her as a visual means of identifying Harry, since in the book it's more complicated.    Hermione erasing her existence - removing knowledge and memory of herself from her parents' minds and sending them off to Australia under new identities so that they aren't a target. There is something incredibly tragic about this, though it doesn't get much attention. I can't imagine the kind of strength and resolve it would take to do that, though the realities of the world would probably help give you the resolve.    Kreacher becoming an ally. And all for an act of genuine kindness (Harry gives him \"Master Regulus'\" locket after hearing his story). And what he was made to do for Voldemort. Nothing, not even Kreacher, is black and white, and that's an important lesson to learn. He betrayed Sirius at the end of The Order of the Phoenix, but when you learn more about him, you realise it's not a simple matter at all.    Dobby's death. He was such a brave, selfless elf, and as characters, he and Kreacher really brought into sharp relief the whole issue of house elves and their mistreatment.    The mortality of the Weasley's. Until this book, they always struck me as one of those solid features who come close to utter tragedy but always manage to avoid it, like with Arthur getting attacked by the snake. Here, though, George loses an ear and, at the end, Fred is killed. Fred's death is one of the saddest things for me.     Likewise, Lupin and Tonks' deaths at the final battle - I remember reading that the first time and feeling that sense of utter disbelief. I felt it again here, like someone had surely made a mistake, especially when Harry sees their bodies next to Fred and their described as sleeping. But with a newborn left behind, and the fact that Lupin only recently found the first real happiness he's ever known - to have that cut short, it makes me want to cry just typing this. The deaths of these characters had a much bigger impact on me than the death of Dumbledore - as big a surprise as that was on first reading - at the end of The Half-Blood Prince. In a way, Dumbledore had to go so that Harry could come into his own. But these characters, their deaths are so needless, and they were too young and left too much behind.    Snape's love for Lily. I knew there was a good reason why we forgave Snape at the end, but I was glad I couldn't remember exactly what it was. Snape is another complex character, who shows that it's not a simple matter of right or wrong, good or evil. He's not someone to be judged at face value or first impressions, though obviously that's what everyone has been doing all his life. It's not even pity that I felt for him, but empathy at losing the woman he loved and sacrificing everything in memory of her. He never stopped loving her. Timeless love. No wonder Dumbledore trusted him implicitly: he understood the power of such emotions and never dismissed them as insignificant.    The truth about Dumbledore's past, and his sister Ariana. So sad. I haven't seen the second half of the movie version yet but I hope they include these details.    Harry walking to his impending death, supported by the ghosts of his parents, Sirius and Lupin. I cried when James and Lily and Cedric appeared at the end of The Goblet of Fire, and they had no less power here, bolstering their son and being there so he wasn't alone as he went to Voldemort, knowing he was going to be killed - and not knowing that he would survive it.     The dragon kept imprisoned in Gringott's Bank. I felt so bad for the poor tortured beast, and so happy when they freed it.    Xenophilius Lovegood. The position he was in, having his daughter taken away and used as a threat against him, to betray his beliefs (i.e., in Harry as the Chosen One).    Petunia Dursley, Harry's aunt, is a sad figure in her own right. It becomes clear in this book why she was so anti-magic: she was jealous of her sister Lily's ability. The scene where Lily mentions that Petunia wrote to Dumbledore, asking to be let into Hogwarts, and Petunia's feelings of embarrassment and shame and longing, of feeling excluded - you can't help but feel for the little girl who grew into a resentful woman in denial.    There's lots of happy things here too, like Fleur and Bill Weasley's wedding and Ron and Hermione finally getting together, as well as great mini-adventures that all lead up to the final show-down. The plan to get into the Ministry of Magic, and later the Gringott's Bank break-in, for example, were really fun and exciting and scary. And one of my favourite scenes is the Neville Longbottom snake-killing scene - really, I just love all the Neville scenes but that one in particular really stuck in my head all the intervening years since first reading it.And underlying it all is this Hitler-like race and class war that Voldemort is enacting. Muggles and Mud-bloods become demonised and terrorised and everyone has to prove their \"purity\". The film captured this really well in the set design, especially inside the Ministry.I loved that there was so much I couldn't remember when I started this book - I couldn't remember what the Hallows were, or what was inside the Snitch, or how they found the other Horcruxes. I had forgotten Dobby died until I watched the film a few months ago. It was wonderful to read it almost like it was the first time.And then there's the epilogue - I'll mention it because I remember how much fans railed against it when the book first came out. I'm still not sure why, except maybe it wasn't up to the standards of the rest of the series. I read somewhere that Rowling wrote it at the beginning, which is kinda cool, and shows just how well she planned it all out. The line that I love is this one, where Harry tells his son: \"Albus Severus, [...] you were named for two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\" [p.607] It gets me every time.2007 REVIEW - 1ST READINGSo, there were huge expectations - and quite a few bets, debates and demands - for this last book, and personally I thought it was a great ending to the series. One of the things that I love about these books, that has always impressed me, is how tightly plotted they are, how detailed. Others have complained about the plotholes in Deathly Hallows, but I didn't see any. Granted, I wasn't looking for them, and I didn't succeed in my intention to re-read the previous books before this one (managed Philosopher's Stone but left it too late for the others) so I had forgotten some details. Deathly Hallows made me laugh, made me cry (seriously, I bawled - and there were no tissues at the cottage so had to mop my face with paper towel...), had me pressing my knuckles to my mouth (the closest I come to biting my nails), and kept me on the edge of my seat. What more could you ask for? Quite a few characters die in this book, but everyone knew there would be some deaths because Rowling said there would be. She's also said, apparently, that the books are about death, though, having read the last book, I understand now that she doesn't mean they're about death, but about death. The whole idea behind The Boy Who Lived was that his mother's sacrifice protected him from the killing curse, and when Harry in turn sacrifices himself, he protects everyone at Hogwarts (where all the characters assemble for the big show-down) from Lord Voldemort. I also liked how the death of Dumbledore (in the previous book) and Snape's betrayal are resolved; I liked that Snape did it all for love of Lily, Harry's mother. It worked, brought out the humanity that has always lurked deep beneath Snape's corrosive veneer. The saddest deaths were of Fred, one of the Weasley twins, and Lupin and Tonks, only weeks after the birth of their baby. Is it any wonder that I cried? And even though there was always the hope that Harry would survive, still the section leading up to his sacrifice was written so convincingly, so non-melodrammatically, that I actually had to put the book down for a minute and do a quick turn about the house to calm myself down a bit. The only bit that looked like a glaring plothole at first was when Neville pulls the sword of Gryffindor out of the Sorting Hat to lop Voldemort's snake's head off with. That confused me - last we saw of the sword, the goblin had taken it and disappeared into the depths of Gringotts with it. Then I remembered: Harry had pulled the sword out of the Sorting Hat in the Chamber of Secrets, too. The last lingering doubt is why the hat was on fire and why exactly Voldemort wanted to non-sort them then and there. Ah well, it works for dramatic effect! Another part of the book which has received a lot of flak: the epilogue. Saccharine, it's been described. I have to agree, and it's the only bit of saccharine in the entire series. Apparently it was written way back in the 90s, but I don't think that excuses it. It was like icing on the cake - sickly sweet, not at all filling or satisfying, hiding the cake beneath which is what you really want to eat, as long as you can have the icing too. So we learn how they paired up and what their kids' names are, that Neville is a Herbology professor and, well, very little else. Noticeably, Harry's conversation with Dumbledore in King's Cross Station shows how much Harry has grown and matured. He's moved through his teenage angst and become reliable, responsible, thoughtful, more patient. By not going after the Deathly Hallows, his first impulse is tempered by a new, cooler head. Aside from the humour, reminiscent of Roald Dahl, and the plotting, the character development of Harry is another reason why the books are so enjoyable, and long-lasting."},

I wanted him to die in his prime, to be celebrated in song, like all the great heros before him. Alas...Rowling didn't write so much a novel, as she did a Hollywood screenplay! Complete with lame wincing juvenile lines like the one uttered by Molly Weasley to Bellatrix LeStrange in the Battle for Hogwarts, \"Not my daughter, you BITCH!\" A line meant to draw applause, cheers, and laughter from a bunch of teenagers in a darkened movie theater, not a line that would have been used by the prim and proper mother, Molly Weasley, that we grew to know and love in books 1-6.The book could have been better edited as there were long stretches of BORING reading throughout. It's as if Rowling just ran out of creative juices in the end and chose to let her fans write the final book for her. She inserted \"PotterWatch\" as a nod to the PotterCasters(PotterCast and MuggleCast), and she wrote in a nude scene for Harry Potter, as a nod to Daniel Radcliffe's nude stint in Equus. The whole *camping out in the forest waiting for something to happen* part was NOT something I expected after Book 6, when it was shown with such great care how Voldemort had hidden the locket horcrux. I can't believe they are making 2 films out of this, the crappiest book in the series!Oh, and that Epilogue, where to begin? If Rowling sent out apology letters to all her fans for writing it, that still wouldn't be enough of an atonement! The woman should be tarred, feathered, drawn, and quartered for that criminally putrid Epilogue! The visual of a middle aged Harry Potter waiting at the train station to get to his 9 to 5 job was the let-down of the century. I loved Harry because he was special and because of his aura of destiny! I loved that, despite his emotionally abusive childhood, he chose to become a decent human being, instead of following Tom Riddle's path of evil and bitterness! I loved that, when presented with a challenge, he almost always chose to do the right and moral thing, over what was easy. I didn't want to see him become a regular, boring adult, with a lame, humdrum life, he was too talented, too moral, too heroic for all of that mundane crap!"},

I'm too much of a completionist, too OCD for this shit. Even though I rated most of these books below three stars, I felt compelled to finish them because I started them. Even after it took me six months to read GOBLET OF FIRE, I pressed forward. Even though I one-starred ORDER OF THE PHOENIX, I continued on. I had to know why people love these books as much as they do. At least I got my answer.J.K. Rowling did one major thing right with this series. Her writing matured along with her readers. As Potter got older and wiser, so did Rowling's style. This helped her quite a bit because the first three novels are horribly formulaic. But how many middle-grade kids are going to dissect overused plot points and cliched story structure? Not many. And by the time her audience was old enough to start questioning the borrowed ideas and storylines, Rowling had already established her characters and readied her pawns for battle. Had the series maintained the goofy middle-grade tone throughout, it would have likely failed. Had the first three books been as dark as the final four, the series wouldn't have seen half the success it did. In the end, it became a phenomenon because it spoke to the proper age groups at the proper times.I give this series a lot of grief, but not even my cynical ass can ignore Rowling's accomplishments. After writing this series, she went from homeless mother to one of the richest people on the face of the planet. Good for her. But I think her greatest success was getting kids reading again. And while I do not fan flail over these books, I do understand the draw. I understand the nostalgia and fond memories they invoke in their readers. THE DEATHLY HALLOWS was a little heavy in the middle. Its belly meandered and dragged some, but I was never bored to the point I was with PHOENIX. Then again, I think a lot of what I enjoyed about this book stemmed from the knowledge that I was reading the last one in the series. That thought alone made me smile and was a big reason I didn't want to put the book down.I'm glad Neville got his time in the sun, but Snape's story arc was my favorite of the bunch. Luna was another one I liked. Harry didn't really shine for me until book six, and I fucking loathed everything about Ron. I wanted Hermione and Draco to end up together, as they seemed hellbent for each other, but maybe that was just me reading too much into their hatred of one another. I kept expecting Harry to catch them rage fucking in a closet between classes.Finally, I'm pretty sure Peeves and Trelawney were screwing each other every time they were able. Next time you reread this, see if you can catch why I say that. The scene I remember the best out of the entire series is the underwater stuff in GOBLET. In summation: Six easy reads and one big pile of shit equal a series that owes a lot to young readers and nostalgia. Books six and seven are clearly the best of the bunch. If I had to rate the series as a whole, I'd have to give it three stars. Final Judgment: Done at last. Done at last. Thank Tom Cruise almighty I'm done at last!A rundown of my ratings for each book:The Sorcerer's Stone ***The Chamber of Secrets ***The Prisoner of Azkaban **The Goblet of Fire **** (Wow... I don't remember liking this one enough to give it 4 stars...

Perhaps Rowling was more concerned with closure than constructing a more complex story. Then again, she may just be glad to be free of it after all these years. I do congratulate her on getting out while the getting was good.The epilogue particularly felt like an attempt to make an utter and unapologetic finish to the story. Unfortunately, it will likely not keep the questions at bay. I, myself, couldn't but wonder if the older Harry might have adopted a fatherly middle-class mustache. I'll have to pen a letter.Despite the claims that the books were plotted out and foreshadowed from the beginning, we get a lot of last-minute additions to the world to build toward a convenient plot coupon ending. Rowling was, more-or-less, beyond the power of editors, and I wish she had used that power to write an interesting, audacious book, but this ending was very safe, and free from the surprising plot twists Rowling sometimes managed.I guess she was trying to please her fans, but she had a lot of people to please. Hopefully she pleased some of them, but I was disappointed that as the series neared its end, it became less quirky and character-driven, and more predictable and cliche.My Fantasy Book Suggestions"},

I have been a fan of the HP series since about 2000, when a friend recommended Book 1 to me as a cute little book that she was tutoring 5th graders with. I read it, liked it, and figured I'd pick up the next book when it came out.As each book came out, many critics and fans commented that JK had a unique style of approaching her series; the way that her books grew with her targeted audience. The series became darker and more complex, the writing more intense as the series continued.By the 5th book, I was well and truly hooked, and read each book voraciously when it came out. I re-read the entire available series just before the next book was released, and enjoyed them immensely.When Book 7 came out, I was disappointed, but only in the way that a fan is when what they have enjoyed so long is at an end. There would be no more HP books to look forward to. As I had not been part of HP online communities, nor did I enjoy the movies, this was the end of the series for me.Then I read the book, and I was furious. Six books she spent preaching about house unity, and how Hogwarts must unite or fall. Six books she spent warning of a terrible and devastating war that Harry would be in the thick of. Six books that were well enough written between plot and description that I could overlook her lack of characterization for antagonists or the fact that Ginny was essentially a flat character. And then book 7, where she completely ignores everything she spent 6 books setting up, skips around the reality of war by having Harry wander around lost on the moors for a bit, and then pulls a religious analogy out of her hat. Although the religious analogy did make me laugh -- I can't help but wonder if all those who said HP was the devil's work will be praising it like it's Narnia in 10 years.Still, I couldn't believe what she'd done to her work. I don't know if that honestly was her vision from the beginning, as she claims -- if it was, then the entire series suffers for it, and her vision is severely limited. The other alternative is that she sold out or simply didn't care because she's already richer than a queen. Whatever the reasoning, it was an awful, disappointing end to a beautifully textured series.---EDITED TO ADD---I still dislike book 7, although I love the rest of the series. I love how JK structured the books, right? I mean, she's a genius with the foreshadowing and with dropping in information about the characters backgrounds without being heavy handed. She's just a brilliant writer who structured these very rich, well-crafted worlds that hold up to multiple re-readings. I love how the books \"grow\" with the reader, with the first books being written for a younger reader and the later books being written for an older reader. Most of all, I love how she foreshadows across the books, so things that happen in, say, Book 5 are foreshadowed in Books 1 and 2. It's AMAZING. She's so incredibly talented, and it makes reading her books a real treat. Which was why I am still so incredibly upset at reading book 7. See, in Book 7, she brings up this whole notion of those three items (the Elder Wand, Invisibility Cloak, and Philosophers Stone) being tied together by the myth of the three brothers. That's the part that pissed me off. It felt ... cobbled in. Pulled out of a hat, last minute. Like, JK had told us about the numberless clock in the Weasley's house warning us about danger, about hunting for garden gnomes, about the time Ron's teddy bear got turned into a spider ... but she didn't mention this apparently incredibly common wizarding childrens story? She talks about all these daily aspects of wizarding life on a regular basis, introduced through Ron's family, but never once -- never once in 6 entire books does Ron or Ginny or anyone even let out a breath of a whisper about this apparently common wizarding fable? Think about how often you reference common fairy stories and fables in your life. Cinderella, Red Riding Hood, Big Bad Wold, etc. So if JK Rowling actually had this idea of a wizarding fable/myth as a major plot in her overarching series, I think she would have woven it in as foreshadowing much more effectively. What I think happened is this:Right around the time Book 7 was being written, all these internet/ social media/ fanboard sites were really taking off. They weren't huge before then, but they were really taking off as she'd released Books 5 & 6 and was writing book 7. I think that the fans had pretty much figured out what was happening, plot wise -- which is a mark of what a great writer JK Rowling is -- and JK felt bad about that -- which is a natural creative response.I think her publisher advised her to keep quiet about reading the fanboards for legal reasons, which she wisely did, but I fully believe she read them, and that she wasn't happy about two things:(1) The proliferation of fanfic and noncanon fanfic pairings(2) How thoroughly the fans had guessed the key points of the plot (particularly what would be happening with Snape and Dumbledore and the Horcruxes).So I think that JK just sort of pulled that bit about the 3 Wizarding brothers and the ancient fairy tale and 3 legendary items out of her hat (with no foreshadowing regarding this plotline in the previous 6 books) because she wanted to surprise her fans with a sort of \"gotcha\"/ surprise moment. Furthermore, I suspect she wrote in the epilogue as a sort of middle finger to the proliferation of fanfic writers, as though to say, \"And by the way, no. That is not how it happens. Harry and Hermoine do not end up together. Harry and Draco do not end up together. Ron and Pansy do not end up together. These people end up together, in these pairs. I do so decree it, and thus it shall be.\"So that's why I don't like Book: 7. I feel like it's less true to the ethos of the series than the rest of the books. I feel like JK Rowling kind of strayed from herself as a writer ... that she reacted (poorly) to her fans, and that it reflects badly on her work. I can't really enjoy reading the book even now. It feels out of step with the rest of the series.I've mostly moved on. I've forgiven her (even if the insult is imagined). She's a truly talented writer and generous and compassionate woman. She's an inspiration to me, as a writer. And it was a weird time in fandom and for the internet, when that book was being written. Everyone makes mistakes. I think JK has more than made up for the upset of book 7, though -- she wrote 6 other amazing books, she's gracious and considerate in the fandom community, and she's a principled and compassionate woman. A true role model. What's one book in comparison to the rest of her legacy? "},

And I started to understand what he meant. Then I re-read all the books and I thought I needed Internet to help me understand better.I found an awesome article online which made me realize that maybe he was right (you can check it here if you want)Basically the idea is that James Potter generation and Harry Potter generation follow the same pattern. Think about it:- Harry is like James, a leader of the group- Ron is like Sirus, faithful friend- Hermione is like Remus, really smart, a little bit outcast at first but then fully part of the group- And then Neville is Peter Pettigrew. Everyone is making fun of him. Clumsy and chubby.(- According to that theory, Ginny Weasley is Lilly Potter)But this is where the story change. Neville is loyal where Peter is a coward. He stands by Harry no matter what, even if Voldemort asks him to come on his side. This theory says that JKR wanted to show that only one \"side character\" changes the all story. Instead of darkness and terror, Neville is the one who kills the last Horcrux (Nagini) and who defeats Voldemort, instead of joining him and betraying his friends. Just think about it, if Neville would have acted like Peter did, the ending would have been probably the opposite.  U+201CWeU+2019re all going to keep fighting, Harry.

If you don't like him, please see yourself out right about now.Severus Snape is my favourite character of all time. He is such a complex and interesting character, so obbbbviously The Prince's Tale is my favourite chapter.I loved Snape even before the big reveal in the last book. He is very clever and sly, and I just love his sarcasm and his bitterness about the world.Snape isn't the dictionary definition of either \"good\" or \"bad\". He's in the grey area between those two polar opposites. His character taught me that it's human to make mistakes and be imperfect. Most of us aren't the chosen ones or the perfect Prince Charmings; we all have flaws, it's what makes us human. . ....My Review of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"},

The first four were so wonderful and even though the next 3 books (plot-wise) went downhill for me, this ending had me smiling and reminded me why these books are so much more than children's tales. There are so many great moments throughout this series and these characters are some I am never going to find and love in other books as much as I do in these books. Hagrid always remained a favorite, along with Ron Weasley and of course Dumbledore!! The boarding of the scarlet train to Hogwarts scenes were another magical yet simply beautiful piece to the story. HEDWIG!! Hermonine and the house elves, Christmas at Hogwarts, Hagrid's dragon Norbert, and the wise and wonderful words of Dumbledore about love for each other. It's a bittersweet feeling completing this series. ALL WAS WELL."},

Maybe I'll be out of my funk by then."},
{"rating": 5, "text": "As a whole series, my average rating for the series ends up roughly around 4 stars. This is purely because once the series gets over its initial roughness, keeping the charm and developing the characters it becomes a very solid and imaginative series. It may not be the 'epic' that some people are looking for in their fantasy - but like The Chronicles of Narnia its a quirky and appealing little series. Let's be honest: nothing I say or do not say about this series will persuade or dissuade anyoneAs a whole series, my average rating for the series ends up roughly around 4 stars. This is purely because once the series gets over its initial roughness, keeping the charm and developing the characters it becomes a very solid and imaginative series. It may not be the 'epic' that some people are looking for in their fantasy - but like The Chronicles of Narnia its a quirky and appealing little series. Let's be honest: nothing I say or do not say about this series will persuade or dissuade anyone from reading these books if they put their mind to either standpoint. All I can say is how I found the novels and with all honesty I found that they improved so much that I think I will actually miss not having another book in the series to move on and read. I'm a huge reader of fantasy and have been since my mother read The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe to me as a six year old child (I went on to read the novel for myself the following year). There's something about the way a truly great fantasy novel can take you to a whole other world (same with sci-fi) and yet remind you about real world concepts, themes, emotions and values that is appealing. So, I admit that when other children grew up on Harry Potter, I grew up on the novels which preceded Harry Potter. I grew up in Narnia, Middle Earth, Wonderland, Neverland and so on. So as I saw the hype for the Harry Potter series (coupled with the fact that my parents thought the books a touch too dark for my age) I may have decided to avoid reading them, thinking that they were copycats of other, better, books. How snobbish of me.I would easily add this series (for the improvement, character building, world etc.) to my list of unique fantasy series. Of course this would be a list featuring the before mentioned books and also anything by Brandon Sanderson (particularly his Mistborn books), The Wheel of Time (if you don't mind looooong drawn out epic fantasy tales) and The Name of the Wind (as far as it has gone till now). I definitely am willing to recommend any books that you might like if you grew up on Harry Potter or anything similar. Pardon my ramblings, all I wish to say is that I was very impressed with the series after being less than so with the first two and a half books. The other four fully make the most of the promise of the first few books however and therefore create works of fiction which perform all that I believe literature should do.In the novels there are subtle and nuanced reflections on education and the influence of governments and politics on daily life. Rowling seems to imply that while government is a great thing behind the scenes to keep the world running there are times when it meddles in the greater good. Leonard Nimoy (RIP) passed away earlier and he once said (in character) that 'the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few'. I believe this is the concept that Rowling wished to convey about education and government. The few are in power and authority and it is their job to fulfill the needs of the many, not their own.I also love the final part of this novel with its very Christian message. In some ways Harry becomes a rough Christ figure in these novels (which has lead to the book's fair share of criticism such as how can you mix a message of faith with magic etc.) with how his love and sacrifice for his friends enables him to be able to defeat dark magic. It's a similar theme to that used in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe but in a different way and I loved how it was used here. I was often told that the books were so non-Christian with the magic and everything but this conclusion is very Christian in how it conveys that evil is created through fear and a desire to become like God (all-powerful like Voldemort attempts to become) and that only sacrificial love can truly defeat the curse of evil. It's a great message and I would definitely not hide these books or ban them, I would encourage children to read them and then ask them questions about those themes!All in all, I definitely enjoyed the books and have also been enjoying the movies simultaneously. I wish in some senses that I had read them sooner and definitely recommend them for the story. Don't be sucked in by the hype, but do read them for their beautiful little story and thematic expression!"}
